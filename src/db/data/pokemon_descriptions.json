Sample set. Stay tuned for updates!"

  "Alomomola": {
    "name": "Alomomola",
    "text": "Alomomola's gargantuan HP stat, good defensive typing, and access to Regenerator make it one of the best defensive pivots available. The combination of Wish, Regenerator, and Flip Turn makes it the premier Wish passer in OU, able to heal defensive teammates without reliable recovery like Dondozo and Ting-Lu. Scald bolsters Alomomola's defensive presence, with its burn chance permanently threatening physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Meowscarada while cutting down the longevity of switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and opposing Alomomola. Flip Turn separates Alomomola from other bulky Water-types as a slow pivot, letting it bring in other Pokemon safely while creating momentum on the slower-paced teams it often finds itself on. On top of reliably gaining recovery from Wish, Protect has many more applications for Alomomola; it allows Alomomola to scout Choice item users like Walking Wake and Gholdengo, scout for potential double switches by the opponent, gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, and stall out an additional turn of burn damage from Scald. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs ensures that Alomomola is as slow as possible for pivoting effectively. Tera Flying turns Alomomola's weakness to Grass into a resistance, letting it better take on Rillaboom. It also allows Alomomola to avoid Spikes damage if it loses its item to Knock Off, letting it act as a good Knock Off absorber. Tera Dark and Tera Steel are viable alternatives; the former lets Alomomola more capably check Hex Dragapult and the latter giving Alomomola a generally solid defensive typing to aid against Meowscarada and Fairy-types like Enamorus. These also let Alomomola act as a solid absorber of Future Sight from Galarian Slowking. Maximum HP and maximum Defense strengthens Alomomola's monstrous physical bulk, becoming better suited to face the likes of Weavile, Iron Boulder, and Barraskewda. Meanwhile, thanks to Alomomola's astounding HP stat, an EV spread with maximum Defense and Special Defense is also solid, letting Alomomola capably take hits from special attackers such as Hex Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus while still possessing solid physical bulk, letting it pivot into a more variety of attackers in general. Rocky Helmet and Red Card can be run over Heavy-Duty Boots; the former further enhances Alomomola's role as a physical wall, letting it switch in and punish Pokemon like Weavile and Meowscarada for Triple Axel while also being able to wear down Kingambit, and the latter allows Alomomola act as a one-time phazer against setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Kingambit, and Dragonite. Alomomola performs best on balance and stall teams due to the sheer value of Wish for teammates that lack reliable recovery. Potent defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Great Tusk heavily appreciate Alomomola's gargantuan Wish to heal them reliably, as these walls often struggle to recover themselves after chip damage. Similarly, on stall, the likes of Dondozo and Clodsire appreciate Alomomola's Wish help them better deal with chip damage while also letting them preserve Rest and Recover PP, respectively. Additionally, they appreciate Alomomola's effectiveness as a pivot, as it can let them switch in without taking any damage thanks to its relatively low Speed. Special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Skeledirge can cover Alomomola's weaker Special Defense, handling the likes of Iron Valiant and Heatran. Other Pokemon with Regenerator such as Galarian Slowking and Tornadus-T can form potent Regenerator cores, making them difficult to wear down in the face of entry hazards. All of these Pokemon also appreciate Alomomola's capability to take Knock Off rather well. Alomomola is deathly afraid of Ogerpon-W because of Water Absorb. It can easily set up on and decimate Alomomola even after it Terastallizes. Thus, checks to Ogerpon-W such as Rillaboom and Zamazenta make for excellent partners. The former two also appreciate Alomomola's Wish supporting their otherwise shaky longevity. Amoonguss's access to Toxic lets Alomomola have an easier time chipping down and stalling out foes with Flip Turn and Wish, respectively. Offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, , Meowscarada, and Landorus-T appreciate Alomomola's slow pivoting and ability to pass large Wishes to assist with their longevity. Alomomola can use Assault Vest to improve its poor Special Defense, becoming a mixed defensive pivot at the expense of Wish. Alomomola can soak up both special and physical moves from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Iron Moth and pivot out with Flip Turn, with Regenerator recovering most of the damage taken. Scald is Alomomola's best move if it wants to stay in, fishing for burns that help pressure defensive switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire and cripple opposing physical attackers like Dragonite, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Play Rough hits Pokemon that would switch in easily to Scald such as Raging Bolt, Hydrapple, and Walking Wake while chipping down Ogerpon-W decently. Play Rough also helps pressure Calm Mind Iron Valiant, which can otherwise punish Alomomola's Mirror Coat with Encore or repeated use of Calm Mind, and threatens Dark-type special attackers like Darkrai and Greninja that do not fear Mirror Coat at all. A Sassy nature completes the build to be as slow as possible, as it notably Speed ties opposing Alomomola as well as underspeed Hydrapple, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, allowing for Alomomola's teammates to enter safely. Tera Fairy is the primary option to help against rampaging Dragon- and Dark-types like Dragonite, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon while additionally boosting the damage from Play Rough to the point of securing an OHKO against Roaring Moon and a 2HKO against Hisuian Samurott and Iron Valiant. Tera Steel is a secondary option that improves matchups against Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Grass-types like Rillaboom, Meowscarada, and Ogerpon and lets it resist Stealth Rock. Either Tera type can also help against Raging Bolt and Hydrapple, two special attackers that can boost past the threat of Mirror Coat and thus pose a major threat to Alomomola. The additional 20 HP EVs allow Alomomola to survive Tera Ice Choice Specs Kyurem's Freeze-Dry after Stealth Rock. Assault Vest Alomomola fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to tank hits and pivot but do not require the sustained healing from Wish. Strong and fast attackers like Darkrai, Dragapult, and Deoxys-S appreciate Alomomola's ability to provide them with a safe entrance after a slow Flip Turn while at the same time being able to switch in on potential revenge killers like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Weavile, and Roaring Moon. Offensive pivots like Landorus-T, Raging Bolt, and Cinderace can form a VoltTurn core with Alomomola and appreciate it tanking hits and pivoting on Darkrai and Walking Wake. Physical walls like Zamazenta and Skarmory can benefit from Alomomola handling special attackers like Iron Moth and Dragapult, allowing them to wall or set up on remaining physical threats that can threaten Alomomola such as Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, the latter of which can even prevent Alomomola from pivoting around freely. Ground-type teammates like Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Iron Treads are a must to handle foes like Raging Bolt and Zapdos; besides the threat of setup from Calm Mind Raging Bolt, they can also pivot out with Volt Switch, doing big damage and avoiding the answer of Mirror Coat by pivoting to a Dark-type like Kingambit or Ting-Lu. Alomomola is vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, so Poison-types like Iron Moth and Pecharunt can be a good fit. Similarly, Spikes and Stealth Rock can also wear down Alomomola due to the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots, preventing its ability to survive and pivot for longer and ruining the surprise of the Assault Vest. To handle this, teammates like Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Hatterene can help to remove and prevent hazards. Corviknight can also help as a check to Grass-types like Hydrapple and Rillaboom."

  "Altaria": {
    "name": "Altaria",
    "text": "Altaria's wide variety of utility options like Defog, Will-O-Wisp, Haze, and Roar, great defensive stats, useful ability in Natural Cure, and excellent typing allowing it to check a wide variety of Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W, Golurk, Bruxish, and Hariyama make it one of PU's few forms of entry hazard control and a decent wall, although it needs to watch out for Ice-type coverage from Pokemon like Golurk and Scrafty. Brave Bird allows Altaria to not be completely passive and helpless against Taunt from Pokemon like Bombirdier and Skuntank while also doing more damage than Hurricane against specially defensive Pokemon like Florges and Delphox. Altaria's choice of its final move is flexible; Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers Altaria switches into like Paldean Tauros-W, Scrafty, and Decidueye. Haze allows Altaria to prevent setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Delphox and Zoroark as well as Curse Arcanine from using it as setup fodder, while Roar does the same but also functions better against Substitute users such as Scream Tail, although it can be counterintuitive with Defog due to not being able to accrue chip damage from hazards that Defog removes. The given EV spread allows Altaria to outspeed Golurk and Adamant Emboar while still providing as much bulk as possible, although a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD can be used to be bulkier if outspeeding these two is not needed. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 120 SpD / 136 Spe can allow Altaria to become a better special wall, checking Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Meloetta better. Tera Steel flips all of Altaria's weaknesses, allowing it to more safely threaten Pokemon like Alolan Sandslash, Florges, and Scream Tail, although Terastallizing does make it unable to check Fighting- and Fire-types like Flamigo and Delphox as well as removing Altaria's Ground immunity, making the matchup against hazard setters like Gligar and Mudsdale harder. Due to its relative passivity, Altaria fits mostly on bulky balance teams needing a Defogger that can also compress multiple roles. Altaria's ability to absorb status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave is appreciated by other walls like Wo-Chien and Gastrodon as well as setup sweepers like Delphox and Virizion. In turn, Pokemon like Wo-Chien and Virizion can be reliable Knock Off absorbers for Altaria, so it does not lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Altaria finds itself extremely susceptible to Ice- and Fairy-types like Alolan Sandslash, Froslass, and Florges as well as coverage moves like Triple Axel from Ambipom; checks to these threats like Bronzong, Skuntank, and Rotom-H thus make excellent partners. Specially defensive walls like Bronzong, Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, and Florges create a defensive backbone with Altaria. Altaria's ability to check and burn physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-W, Zoroark, and Flamigo allows Pokemon that are checked by these threats like Arcanine and Houndstone become more potent attackers. Altaria's ability to remove entry hazards allows Pokemon particularly weak to them like Choice Scarf Staraptor, Arcanine, and Galarian Slowbro to become bigger threats."

  "Ambipom": {
    "name": "Ambipom",
    "text": "Ambipom is a capable offensive pivot that can create momentum as an anti-offense lead, or it can revenge kill foes and clean up late-game with its Technician-boosted Fake Out and impressive Speed tier. Opposing sweepers, other revenge killers, and fast pivots such as Shift Gear Toxtricity, Choice Scarf Staraptor, and Kilowattrel, whose Speed tiers make them otherwise hard to deal with, can be picked off or forced out by using Fake Out. U-turn allows Ambipom to escape after dealing Fake Out chip or maintain pressure on an anticipated switch. Knock Off serves as coverage for Ghost-types such as Decidueye and Golurk while also making progress by removing key items like Heavy-Duty Boots from users such as Bombirdier and Eviolite from foes such as Hisuian Qwilfish. Triple Axel provides Technician-boosted coverage for potential switch-ins, being most effective against Gligar and Altaria. Alternatively, Double-Edge provides a more accurate and STAB-boosted option that has a chance to OHKO frailer offensive Pokemon—Tatsugiri and Salazzle being two examples. Double Hit is another STAB-boosted option that trades accuracy and some power for longevity, especially when paired with Protective Pads. Because of its frequent pivoting, Ambipom often uses Heavy-Duty Boots for greater longevity throughout games, avoiding chip damage from entry hazards. Protective Pads guards Ambipom from contact effects like Flame Body burns and Rocky Helmet chip damage, which are most inhibiting to sets with Triple Axel and Double Hit. Silk Scarf and Tera Normal achieve a similar effect for Ambipom, improving key Fake Out rolls in a pinch by consistently 2HKOing Kilowattrel and Salazzle, whose high Speed can mandate trading Pokemon for Fake Out hits. Tera Normal or Silk Scarf Double-Edge and Double Hit also have respectable damage outputs, OHKOing Tatsugiri and Zoroark. When used together, Ambipom gains legitimate wallbreaking potential: Tera Normal Silk Scarf Double-Edge has a favorable roll to 2HKO Galarian Slowbro and Bellibolt, the two best physical walls in the tier. Ambipom is well suited for bulky or fast offense and balance teams susceptible to fast threats and opposing setup. Sweepers such as Dragon Dance Scrafty and Calm Mind Scream Tail that have fewer chances to set up may be picked off by speed control or trade damage with bulkier Pokemon like Goodra and Meloetta. Thus, Ambipom's ability to apply pressure after they faint and prevent counter sweeps is a helpful addition. Entry hazard users like Gastrodon and Gligar also synergize with Ambipom, taking advantage of Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots to wear down susceptible foes—removal options like Alolan Sandslash and Defog Scyther rely on Heavy-Duty Boots to switch in several times. Hazards also allow Ambipom to wear down teams by repeated switching and enable Silk Scarf sets to break through chipped switch-ins like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, which it 2HKOes with Stealth Rock up. Unfortunately, without Protective Pads, Ambipom is very susceptible to contact abilities like Static and Flame Body, and it struggles to break common physical walls like Bellibolt and defensive Galarian Slowbro that it cannot consistently 2HKO after Terastallizing without Silk Scarf. As such, it benefits from wallbreakers such as Toxtricity and Golurk that clear through these checks. Ambipom also appreciates bulky teammates with recovery such as Milotic and Florges, allowing a safe switch in after using U-turn. Finally, variants of Ambipom not using Heavy-Duty Boots are easily worn down by opposing hazards and appreciate removal from teammates like Coalossal and Altaria, which in turn appreciate Ambipon providing more opportunities for them to be brought in on favorable matchups and remove hazards or make progress with other utility moves."

  "Ampharos": {
    "name": "Ampharos",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Ampharos is flexible to use thanks to its decent bulk, useful ability in Static, ability to pivot, and its above average Special Attack. It can be used as a slow pivot that punishes U-turn, a low budget wallbreaker with Choice Specs, or a setup sweeper with Agility and Meteor Beam. However, due to its low Speed, Ampharos is prone to easily being KOed before doing much and is easily forced out by any Ground-type. Slow Pivot: Ampharos's low Speed coupled with Volt Switch allows it to safely bring in wallbreakers. In addition, it can easily spread paralysis via Static and Thunder Wave. However, due to its lack of recovery, this is limited, and it is quickly worn down. Setup Sweeper: Ampharos can become a sweeper with the combination of Agility and Meteor Beam. It can struggle to set up though, so it often needs dual screens support or a free switch. This set also thuds against many Ground-types, so they need to be worn down before it can sweep. It also fails to outspeed faster Pokemon with Choice Scarf or Booster Energy. Primary STAB Moves: Thunderbolt, Discharge, Thunder, Volt Switch Setup Moves: Agility, Meteor Beam, Cotton Guard Utility Moves: Thunder Wave, Roar, Dragon Tail, Brick Break, Rest Coverage: Focus Blast, Dazzling Gleam, Power Gem, Tera Blast Reflect / Light Screen: With Light Clay, Ampharos can work as a dual screens setter that can safely bring in a teammate with Volt Switch. However, due to its low Speed, it can get KOed before getting up a single screen and is easy to Taunt. Endure: Endure allows Ampharos to gain another chance to possibly cripple a physical revenge killer with paralysis thanks to Static. Rocky Helmet: Rocky Helmet with Static allows Ampharos to further punish contact and pivot moves such as U-turn and Flip Turn. Heavy-Duty Boots: Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Ampharos from being chipped by entry hazards and greatly increases its longevity. Power Herb: Power Herb is the item of choice for setup sets, as it turns Meteor Beam into a one-turn move. Assault Vest: Assault Vest can make Ampharos into a sturdy special wall that can easily check threats like Zapdos and Tornados-T. However, it loses useful utility against physical threats. Light Clay: Light Clay can be used if Ampharos is a screens setter, although it is can be easily stopped with Taunt due to its low Speed. Leftovers: Leftovers can give Ampharos more longevity as a defensive pivot, especially against more passive teams. It is still very easily worn down, however. Air Balloon: Air Balloon allows Ampharos to switch into Ground-type attacks as long as it remains intact. This can ease using Thunder Wave against threats that have Ground-type coverage. Sitrus Berry: Sitrus Berry gives Ampharos more HP to work with, allowing it to stay in against threats and cripple them with Thunder Wave more easily. Choice Specs: Choice Specs makes Ampharos a strong but prediction-reliant wallbreaker thanks to its above average Special Attack and decent coverage. Ampharos is not the best option as a Tera Captain, since its low Speed doesn't allow it to take advantage of it very well. Defensive sets should usually never Terastallize, since it is worn down easily. If it is used as Tera Captain, Meteor Beam sets can use Tera Ice, Water, and Grass. Tera Ice eases breaking through Grass-types and destroys Gliscor. Tera Water provides Ampharos coverage for Ground- and Fire-types. Tera Grass can deal with Ground-types and Water / Ground types. Tera Flying can also be used to ease setup while providing coverage for Grass-types. Ampharos should not be the Pokemon that a team is built around due to its low Speed and lack of longevity. It fits well on teams that appreciate a resistance to Flying, U-turn punisher, or low-budget wallbreaker. Ground-type Checks: Ground-types prevent Ampharos from freely using Volt Switch and Thunderbolt, so Water-type allies that threaten them such as Greninja, Iron Bundle, and Palafin are appreciated. Rillaboom and other offensive Grass-types also work well. Kyurem and Baxcalibur demolish Ground-types and pair well with Ampharos, since it can provide slow pivoting to help them set up. Setup Sweepers: Ampharos can safety bring in allies off a Volt Switch and deal a good amount of damage to Pokemon that take neutral damage to the move. Pokemon that take advantage of a free switch and weakened checks such as Gouging Fire, Ogerpon-W, and Kingambit make great teammates. Ground-types: Ampharos is quickly threatened by Ground-types and cannot paralyze them. Choice Specs sets can only deal with them on the switch-in with excellent prediction. It is completely unable to break past bulky specially defensive Ground-types like Clodsire and Hippowdon. Fast Pokemon: Due to Ampharos's low Speed, it is easily revenge killed by any Pokemon with a good Speed tier and decent offensive stat. Protect / Substitute: Protect removes any ability for Choice Specs sets to surprise the opponent, while Substitute prevents Ampharos from using Thunder Wave. Entry Hazards: Due to Ampharos's lack of recovery, any form of entry hazards quickly wears it down and prevents it from being a useful Volt Switch pivot."

  "Arbok": {
    "name": "Arbok",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: While it may seem underwhelming, Arbok is a surprisingly decent low-cost Poison-type that fills lots of roles and offers great utility. Its Poison typing along with Intimidate lets it check many of the metagame's best physical wallbreakers, especially Fighting-, Grass-, and Fairy-types. It can also cripple foes with Glare and Knock Off, and setup sweepers cannot reliably set up on it, since it has Haze and Dragon Tail. Its defensive stats are relatively average, however, so it struggles taking strong hits, especially from special attackers. It also has an average Attack stat with few reliable coverage options, meaning it often gets walled by specific foes. Defensive Utility / Disruption: Arbok works best when using its wide array of utility options to cripple foes and support its own teammates. It can effectively switch in on many physical attackers with Intimidate, and it can weaken them with Rocky Helmet in some occasions. It can punish switch-ins with Glare and Knock Off, stop setup sweepers with Haze and Dragon Tail, and set Toxic Spikes while preventing foes from setting them up as well. Primary STAB Moves: Gunk Shot, Poison Jab Setup Moves: Coil Utility Moves: Knock Off, Glare, Toxic Spikes, Toxic, Haze, Switcheroo, Dragon Tail, Pain Split Coverage: Crunch, Earthquake, Fire Fang, Ice Fang, Leech Life, Psychic Fangs, Rock Slide, Seed Bomb, Thunder Fang, Scale Shot Scale Shot: Although it is unreliable as coverage, Scale Shot lets Arbok boost its Speed while doing a decent amount of damage, which can synergize well with Coil in some scenarios. Rest: While Intimidate is often preferred, Rest works really well with Shed Skin, giving Arbok a good chance of waking up immediately so that it does not have to rely on Pain Split to recover health. Rocky Helmet: With Intimidate, Rocky Helmet works well in further punishing physical attacks, especially if they try to pivot out with U-turn or Flip Turn. Black Sludge: Black Sludge provides Arbok with much-needed passive recovery so that it can switch in and take hits more often. Sitrus Berry: Sitrus Berry is preferred over Black Sludge when Arbok is expected to switch in on a very strong attack so that it can turn a 2HKO into a 3HKO. Heavy-Duty Boots: Arbok can get weakened throughout the game by Spikes and Stealth Rock, so Heavy-Duty Boots can negate that if it needs to stay healthy, especially if Knock Off is not a concern. Mental Herb: Arbok is reliant on its status moves to disrupt and phaze foes, so Mental Herb prevents it from getting stopped from Taunt or locked into a move from Encore. Shuca Berry: Since Arbok cannot do much to Ground-types, it can take a hit when opponents expect it to switch out so that it can use Glare or Knock Off to weaken the foe. Switcheroo Items: With Switcheroo, Arbok can cripple foes that switch into it with items such as Lagging Tail, Toxic Orb, and Choice Band. Choice Band also gives it a little more offensive pressure that can catch foes off guard before using Switcheroo. Arbok can work decently as a secondary Tera Captain if no other cheap Pokemon on its team benefit from Terastallization. While its Poison typing is usually ideal for checking specific foes, it can use other defensive Tera types like Tera Steel and Fairy to check other Pokemon. It can also gain stronger coverage from Tera Water, Ground, and Fighting to make Coil sets more effective. Arbok works best on teams that are notably weak to Fairy-, Grass-, and Fighting-types. It should not come to matches often, as it's relatively weak, but it occasionally does a great job in checking many of the metagame's best physical wallbreakers, including Ogerpon, Iron Valiant, Sneasler, Zarude, and Meowscarada. It also provides good support by removing foes' items and spreading status so that its teammates can win late-game. Ground-types: Although they have to watch out for Glare on the switch-in, Ground-types like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire wall all of Arbok's coverage and deal large amounts of damage back, allowing them free opportunities to deal damage or set entry hazards. Strong Special Attackers: Special attackers like Chi-Yu, Gholdengo, and Terapagos do not need to worry about Intimidate and can easily blast through Arbok's average Special Defense. Substitute: Foes that resist Poison can easily use Substitute in front of Arbok, rendering it useless and allowing them to set up or wallbreak without any risk."

  "Arcanine": {
    "name": "Arcanine",
    "text": "Arcanine is one of PU's strongest and most threatening sweepers and cleaners thanks to its great natural bulk, decent defensive typing, great ability in Intimidate, and Curse + Extreme Speed naturally synergizing together. Curse boosts Arcanine's physical stats, making it a stronger threat and a bulkier attacker while also naturally synergizing with Extreme Speed and Intimidate. Morning Sun provides recovery, allowing Arcanine to alleviate its Stealth Rock weakness and recover against more passive walls like Altaria and Wo-Chien. An alternative to Morning Sun is Close Combat, which prevents Arcanine from being walled by Coalossal and does more damage to Water-types than Extreme Speed before Terastallization; however, it severely cuts into Arcanine's longevity. Leftovers aids with Flare Blitz recoil, although it does leave Arcanine extremely weak to entry hazards. Heavy-Duty Boots is another viable option to make it completely immune to Stealth Rock and other entry hazards, although it does come at the cost of Arcanine solely relying on Morning Sun to recover off damage. The given EV spread allows Arcanine to outspeed Modest Toxtricity before a Curse. Tera Normal removes all of Arcanine's weaknesses, allowing it to set up on Pokemon like Decidueye and non-Clear Smog Gastrodon while also boosting Extreme Speed, enabling it to pick off faster attackers like Kilowattrel and Staraptor after a Curse. Arcanine fits on a variety of teams but most commonly finds itself on hyper offense and balance teams looking for a powerful sweeper and setup threat. Arcanine struggles to deal with bulky physically defensive walls that can cripple it with status or phaze it like Bellibolt, Mudsdale, and Galarian Slowbro, so checks to these Pokemon like Golurk and Tatsugiri make excellent partners. Other physical attackers like Decidueye and Flamigo also make great partners, as they work together with Arcanine to chip away at their shared checks like Bellibolt and Houndstone. If Arcanine is using Leftovers as its item, entry hazard control from Pokemon like Tastugiri, Scyther, and Altaria can help alleviate Arcanine's Stealth Rock weakness to make it a more potent sweeper. As Arcanine struggles to set up against special attackers like Toxtricity and Scream Tail, special walls like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and Milotic can provide a defensive backbone for Arcanine to fall back on."

  "Arcanine-Hisui": {
    "name": "Arcanine-Hisui",
    "text": "Extreme Speed gets the jump on everything in the tier and backs up Hisuian Arcanine's potent STAB moves by letting it revenge kill frailer offensive Pokemon from high HP like Greninja, Ogerpon, and Latios. Notably, it can even prevent Adamant Lokix from revenge killing Hisuian Arcanine with First Impression. The perfect coverage afforded by these moves lets it fit a utility option into its last moveslot. Hisuian Arcanine is a great Stealth Rock setter thanks to its great matchup against Excadrill and Mandibuzz, the most common entry hazard removers, but it can also use Morning Sun to let its user more recklessly switch it in against foes like Tinkaton and Zapdos. Howl can be used over either choice to boost Hisuian Arcanine's Attack, letting it more easily cleave through offense with a boosted Extreme Speed. A Jolly nature with Tera Normal is chosen to let Hisuian Arcanine get the jump on Excadrill and to give Extreme Speed a much-needed power boost against offensive teams. Hisuian Arcanine best fits on offensive teams and is best supported by offensive teammates that can break through the few things that can take on its STAB attacks. Latios can break through Toxapex, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon, and it can help with some offensive foes that Hisuian Arcanine struggles to revenge kill like Sand Rush Excadrill while also switching into Keldeo for it. Stealth Rock setters like Tinkaton let Hisuian Arcanine more freely run Morning Sun, and in return it relieves some pressure on them to switch into Flying-types like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Tinkaton can also check some foes Hisuian Arcanine struggles with, like the Normal-resistant faster offensive threats Ogerpon-C. Pivot support from allies like Lokix and Tornadus-T can bring Hisuian Arcanine in on prey like Tinkaton and Zapdos. Strong Water-types like Azumarill and Greninja can help Hisuian Arcanine with bulky Ground-types like Hippowdon and Rhyperior that cause it problems."

  "Arceus": {
    "name": "Arceus",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Arceus is debatably Ubers's most terrifying and dangerous setup sweeper thanks to a powerful STAB-boosted Extreme Speed, decent defenses, and a wide array of utility and coverage moves, letting it mix and match to win problematic matchups easily. Arceus also has an excellent defensive profile, allowing it to take on Ghost-types like Lunala and Flutter Mane. Extreme Speed allows Arceus to operate as a revenge killer, making it difficult for opposing setup sweepers like Scale Shot Koraidon, Miraidon, and Rayquaza to sweep. However, Arceus is not without its flaws, as physically bulky walls like Ting-Lu, Arceus-Water, and especially Necrozma-DM all check it and give it difficulty when attempting to sweep. Furthermore, while more uncommon, Arceus often struggles to beat bulky Ghost-types like Tera Ghost Koraidon, Tera Ghost Miraidon, Giratina-O, Lunala, and Skeledirge, as they can tank unboosted Shadow Claw and cripple Arceus with status. Arceus's lack of resistances and weakness to status moves like Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, and Thunder Wave can make it potentially hard to switch onto the battlefield safely. Despite that, Arceus is still one of the best Pokemon in Ubers, and every team must prep for it if they do not want to get easily cleaned by it. Shadow Claw is Arceus's best option into Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Giratina-O, and Skeledirge if it does not run Earthquake, making it valuable coverage. Arceus's final moveslot is extremely flexible; Taunt shuts down recovery and status from Pokemon like defensive Arceus formes and Giratina-O and also prevents it from being phazed by Pokemon like Ho-Oh. Recover allows Arceus to negate chip damage, potentially set up multiple times in a game, and also take on Calm Mind Arceus variants. Earthquake allows Arceus to hit Pokemon like Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM for better damage than Shadow Claw. On Silk Scarf and Life Orb sets, Double-Edge is an option to OHKO Gliscor after a Swords Dance and deal heavy damage to opposing bulky Arceus formes. Generally, Arceus most commonly runs Heavy-Duty Boots to negate entry hazard damage, allowing it to sweep more easily. Silk Scarf is an option instead, allowing Arceus to achieve thresholds like OHKOing Miraidon after a Swords Dance and Koraidon after a Swords Dance and layer of Spikes. Although niche, Lum Berry gives Arceus the one-time ability to avoid crippling status from Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Giratina-O, while Leftovers can be used to slightly negate chip damage. Tera Fire is the preferred Tera type, as it allows Arceus to set up against Ho-Oh, check Koraidon and Zacian-C, and become immune to Will-O-Wisp. An alternative is Tera Ghost, giving Arceus the ability to set up on Pokemon like Zacian-C, opposing Extreme Speed Arceus, and Choice Scarf Koraidon. Finally, Tera Normal can be used to boost Extreme Speed, allowing Arceus to achieve thresholds like OHKOing Koraidon and offensive Eternatus after a Swords Dance. Arceus fits on practically every playstyle, but it best fits on more offensive structures looking for a late-game cleaner that can also potentially operate as a mid-game wallbreaker and revenge killer. One of Arceus's bigger issues is Necrozma-DM, which sponges the majority of its attacks and checks it; Pokemon that can lure in Necrozma-DM and chip it down like Zacian-C and Calyrex-I thus make excellent partners. Other physical attackers like Koraidon and Rayquaza can be good partners to wear down shared checks like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Fairy. Arceus also baits out Terastallization, which is useful to prevent Pokemon like Scale Shot Koraidon from being walled by Tera Fairy. Pokemon like Flutter Mane, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao can all wear down bulky Ghost-types that Arceus struggles with like Giratina-O. Miraidon can take out Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Zacian-C, and Necrozma-DM, all of which Arceus can struggle against. Arceus also appreciates entry hazard support from teammates like Ting-Lu and Gliscor on balance teams and Glimmora and Deoxys-S on hyper offense teams, as they put Koraidon into OHKO range by +2 Extreme Speed. Between its great natural bulk, ability to boost its Defense with Bulk Up, and singular weakness, Bulk Up Arceus has incredible survivability and is capable of beating many popular physical attackers and walls like Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Fairy. Extreme Speed and Shadow Claw provide nearly perfect neutral coverage in Ubers. With Tera Fire and Taunt, Arceus sets up on nearly every passive and some offensive Pokemon in the tier, most notably turning Ho-Oh and Zacian-C into setup fodder. 56 EVs in Speed allow Arceus to outspeed unboosted Adamant Rayquaza and Kyurem-B while also outspeeding Zacian-C after Sticky Web. Leftovers is the preferred item for its passive recovery, allowing Arceus to comfortably run Taunt, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used with Recover on teams that are susceptible to Toxic Spikes. Do note, however, that this significantly worsens the matchup into Ho-Oh. This Arceus set fits great on both bulky teams and Sticky Web hyper offense teams as a stallbreaker and sweeper that is difficult for even offensive teams to pick off. On bulky teams, Landorus-T is an excellent partner that can act as a short-term check to Pokemon like Koraidon and Zacian-C, accumulating chip damage on them to the point that Arceus can revenge kill them with Extreme Speed. With Sticky Web support on hyper offense, Bulk Up Arceus gains the ability to outspeed many Pokemon that might give it trouble setting up, most notably Koraidon and Zacian-C. More than many other Pokemon, Bulk Up Arceus hates Toxic Spikes. Thus, Eternatus is an excellent partner, being a remover of Toxic Spikes, Kyogre check, and a sweeper facilitated by Arceus breaking down Eternatus's checks. Checking Miraidon and Kyogre is especially important, as they are among the few Pokemon that can threaten Arceus even if boosted. The aforementioned Eternatus can check Kyogre and remove Toxic Spikes, and Ting-Lu can check Miraidon and set Spikes. Miraidon and Zacian-C can overwhelm defensive Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water, which can survive even boosted Extreme Speeds and threaten Arceus. Defensive Arceus makes use of its fantastic bulk to wall many offensive tier staples such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, Calyrex-I, and Kyurem-B. It can even survive a Close Combat from Zacian-C and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, though it cannot switch directly into it. Its ability to run Heavy-Duty Boots lets it fit onto teams without dedicated hazard control, allowing it to constantly re-enter the field without being whittled down by hazards. Iron Defense turns Arceus into an excellent physical check, being able to beat many common physical attackers as well as Pokemon such as Koraidon and Zacian-C, which might have coverage against it. Dragon Tail provides phazing and allows Arceus to rack up hazard damage on switch-ins with entry hazards, as well as shutting down sweepers at the cost of HP if they choose to attack instead of using setup moves. While Arceus will not always Terastallize, it can use it to great effect against teams running Koraidon or Zacian-C. Tera Water helps wall Tera Fire Pokemon, as well as resisting attacks such as Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike, Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, and Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance. Tera Fairy is an excellent defensive typing that especially improves the matchup against Koraidon. A Bold Nature can be run over Impish if Arceus chooses to run Foul Play as its only damaging move. Despite the set name, Stall Arceus is not limited only to stall; it can be used on bulky balance teams as well. Regardless of team composition, Arceus requires hazard support from partners such as Gliscor, Clodsire and Necrozma-DM. It also appreciates the support of Knock Off absorbers such as Gliscor to help prevent Arceus from losing its Heavy-Duty Boots, which would leave it vulnerable to hazards. As Foul Play and Will-O-Wisp both target opposing physical attackers, Arceus tends to invite in special attackers such as Miraidon and Kyogre, so it likes to be paired with special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, or Ting-Lu. Finally, Ho-Oh is another excellent partner, preventing physical attackers from wearing Arceus down with Regenerator and helping it preserve Recover PP. As Arceus cannot take every physical attack, it fits well on teams with other bulky Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Skarmory, Skeledirge, and Dondozo. On more offensive teams, Arceus likes being paired with pivots like Miraidon, Koraidon, and Iron Bundle as well as powerful wallbreakers like Kyogre and Miraidon."

    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Arceus-Fairy is a defensive behemoth that cements itself a place in Ubers as one of the best checks to Koraidon. An immunity to Dragon and a resistance to Low Kick give Arceus-Fairy ample opportunities to switch in while also forcing Koraidon to use Flare Blitz more often and decrease its longevity as a result. Furthermore, Arceus-Fairy's bulk and resistances make it a useful soft check to Pokemon such as Arceus, Giratina-O, Kyurem-B, Zekrom, Chien-Pao, Rayquaza, and even Miraidon and Flutter Mane. Good neutral coverage with Fairy-type Judgment allows Arceus-Fairy to take full advantage of its ample support movepool featuring Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, Stealth Rock, and Taunt. Outside of being a bit passive against Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C and having to play around opposing Terastallization carefully, Arceus-Fairy has little to no flaws and should be strongly considered for any balance team. This set gives Arceus-Fairy its best chance at taking on Koraidon. Thunder Wave is extremely useful for crippling all of Arceus-Fairy's most common switch-ins in Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C. It is also a safe move to use against Koraidon should you expect it to use Tera Fire and is especially useful because Arceus-Fairy discourages all Ground- and Electric-types bar Clodsire from switching in. Will-O-Wisp more directly cripples physical attackers like Koraidon and Necrozma-DM, although it cannot hit Ho-Oh and Tera Fire users. The third moveslot is fairly flexible; Stealth Rock is a good option, as it frees up moveslots for Arceus-Fairy's teammates. Taunt prevents Clodsire and specially defensive Gliscor from being able to use Spikes and Toxic. Dragon Tail can be a good way to rack up entry hazard damage and can phaze setup sweepers that may not mind being hit with status, and it is highly recommended when running Will-O-Wisp. Calm Mind turns Arceus-Fairy into a dangerous setup sweeper, albeit one that requires significant team support to handle Necrozma-DM and especially Ho-Oh. It is a good option on teams that already have plentiful ways to spread status. Tera Water is mandatory in case Arceus-Fairy needs to take a boosted Flare Blitz from Koraidon, and it can be useful in a pinch against Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C. Tera Water in combination with Calm Mind can more easily clean up weakened teams, as Necrozma-DM won't have a coverage option to hit Arceus-Fairy. The EVs allow Arceus-Fairy to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 90 Pokemon such as Kyogre, with the rest being dumped into physical bulk. While Arceus-Fairy is a great wall, it's unable to take on notable physical attackers like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C without Terastallizing. As a result, defensive Necrozma-DM is a fantastic partner, and the two together reasonably cover nearly all physical threats in the tier. Ting-Lu and Clodsire can take on Miraidon and appreciate Arceus-Fairy's Dragon immunity that allows it to pivot into Draco Meteor, making them fantastic teammates. Defensive Ho-Oh, Gliscor, and Eternatus can handle offensive Ho-Oh without much fear of Sacred Fire burns, with Eternatus having the added benefit of checking Kyogre and absorbing Toxic Spikes. Strong but relatively slow wallbreakers such as Kyogre, Swords Dance Necrozma-DM, and offensive Ho-Oh like the paralysis support that Arceus-Fairy can provide. Kyogre notably helps with the Koraidon matchup, as it can pivot into Flare Blitz and bring rain that negates Koraidon's ability, making it a great partner. Giratina-O can handle Arceus-Ground and provide much-appreciated Defog support. Earth Power and Power Gem are coverage options for a fully dedicated Calm Mind set. The problem is that Arceus-Fairy always loses to either Necrozma-DM or Ho-Oh, so while these coverage options are viable, they require dedicated team support. Of the two, Earth Power is more plausible, as Ho-Oh may be crippled by Knock Off support. Losing access to status or Stealth Rock also leaves Arceus-Fairy more passive in general. Fairy-Resistant Tanks: Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C take little damage from Judgment and can use Arceus-Fairy as an opportunity to set up, although none of them like taking Thunder Wave. Tera Fire Users: Arceus-Fairy cannot burn common physical attackers like Koraidon and Necrozma-DM after they have used Tera Fire, which also greatly weakens the power of Judgment. Koraidon can notably guarantee the OHKO on Arceus-Fairy at +2 with Tera Fire Flare Blitz, necessitating Arceus-Fairy to use Tera Water itself. These Pokemon are still vulnerable to Thunder Wave, but they may still be able to sweep with enough boosts. Chip Damage: Arceus-Fairy is vulnerable to all forms of status and entry hazard damage, which force it to use Recover more often and lose momentum. Calm Mind: Calm Mind users like Arceus-Ground, Kyogre, and Arceus-Grass take little from Judgment and can use Calm Mind relatively freely as a result."

    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Arceus-Ghost finds itself in a rather unique position in the tier, being the best Ghost-type in a tier run by Koraidon and also carrying an immunity to Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed. This, along with having a largely unresisted STAB type, means that Arceus-Ghost is able to find many safe opportunities to come in and wreck havoc against some of the major tier staples. It can be an offensive powerhouse on the right teams and a solid support Pokemon on others, but it does find itself held back by its lack of useful resistances. While few Pokemon can hit it super effectively, it can be still overshadowed by Arceus formes with better defensive typings. This set aims to be a setup sweeper that can also prevent Iron Treads from being able to use Rapid Spin. Ghost-type Judgment is naturally resisted by very few Pokemon such as Arceus and Ting-Lu, neither of which appreciate taking a Focus Blast. Power Gem allows Arceus-Ghost to hit Ho-Oh, which can otherwise stomach a Judgment and phaze Arceus-Ghost. A Modest nature in conjunction with Tera Stellar allows for +1 Arceus-Ghost to OHKO opposing Arceus and Ho-Oh with Focus Blast and Power Gem, respectively, while also ensuring that Judgment can OHKO Zacian-C at +1. This set is usually found on Sticky Web teams, as it can spinblock for its teammates while also being able to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame and work well alongside Pokemon such as Swords Dance Koraidon and Zacian-C, which both appreciate Ho-Oh being pressured. It can also free up Tera types for its teammates, as they will not need to run Tera Ghost to deal with Arceus. The major drawback to Arceus-Ghost is the opportunity cost of not being able to run Extreme Killer or Arceus-Ground as the Arceus forme of choice on a team. These Pokemon have far more snowballing potential, as they can use Swords Dance and Dragon Dance while also being far less entry hazard- and Tera-reliant. Support Arceus-Ghost attempts to capitalize on the lack of Ghost-weak Pokemon on most teams while also providing entry hazard-stacking offense with a valuable Rapid Spin immunity, leveraging its strong natural bulk to both act as a soft check to physical attackers and also find late-game setup opportunities. It acts as a soft check to threats such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and Calyrex-I, giving it a unique role as an Arceus forme that can keep Koraidon in check without being easily exploited by Zacian-C. Ghost-type Judgment is incredibly strong, with only one relevant Ghost-resistant Pokemon and one Ghost-immune Pokemon in the entire tier in Ting-Lu and Arceus, respectively, although note that both Pokemon as well as other special walls such as Whirlwind Ho-Oh do shut it down incredibly well. Thankfully, Dragon Tail allows Arceus-Ghost to punish most of these Pokemon by forcing them off the field, with the exception of Arceus-Fairy and Tera Fairy Ho-Oh. Recover is the preferred final move of choice, as this set is not an all-out attacker but rather leverages its bulk to be an unbreakable late-game sweeper. Tera Water provides Arceus-Ghost with a resistance to Koraidon's Flare Blitz while also allowing Arceus-Ghost to survive Glacial Lance from Calyrex-I and Steel-type attacks from Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM, allowing it to safely dispatch them if they've set up. Tera Fairy maintains Arceus-Ghost's ability to check Koraidon while also providing an immunity to Dragon-type attacks from it and Miraidon. Tera Poison allows Arceus-Ghost to become immune to being poisoned by Eternatus's Toxic and Toxic Spikes while still keeping a resistance to Koraidon's Fighting-type STAB moves. A Timid nature and 56 Speed EVs allow Arceus-Ghost to outspeed all unboosted base 95 and slower Pokemon while also covering for defensive Arceus formes and Ho-Oh so that it can safely use Dragon Tail against them first. This set is usually found on entry hazard-reliant balance builds that desperately want a spinblocker, but it can also be seen on standard hyper offense teams for similar reasons. It works well alongside bulky hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu; Eternatus can also work here, as Toxic Spikes can be incredibly deadly for opposing teams if they are unable to remove them. Sadly, support Arceus-Ghost does run into a plethora of issues, most notably because it isn't Arceus-Fairy or -Water and therefore does not resist Koraidon's harder-to-check attacking moves in Scale Shot, Outrage and Flare Blitz as well as Draco Meteor from Miraidon and Origin Pulse from Kyogre. Ghost is not a premier typing for an Arceus forme to have, as having a defensive backbone where one of its core parts is unable to safely check either Koraidon or Miraidon can lead to Arceus-Ghost and its teammates being more easily pressured into Terastallizing to handle either of these threats, which can lead to teams having far weaker Terastallization flexibility. Tera Fighting can be used over Tera Stellar if a Timid spread is opted for and the team can still aptly handle Ho-Oh. Taunt and Will-O-Wisp can also have uses on support sets over Dragon Tail and Calm Mind, but they can struggle to make progress against special attackers and can give free entry points for them. A sacrificial lead set running Stealth Rock, Healing Wish, Taunt, and Judgment is possible, as Arceus-Ghost is able to spinblock, but it is usually outclassed by the same set on Arceus-Fairy. Ting-Lu: Not even +1 Tera Stellar Focus Blast can get close to an OHKO on Ting-Lu, which can then phaze Arceus-Ghost, and support sets find themselves quickly overwhelmed by Ruination, as well as Ting-Lu using Arceus-Ghost as a free opportunity to set up entry hazards. Kingambit: Arceus-Ghost can struggle into Kingambit, as it cannot threaten Kingambit if it does not have Focus Blast, and even when it does, Kingambit can threaten to OHKO Arceus-Ghost with Sucker Punch with minimal chip or just a few fallen allies. Kingambit can also use Arceus-Ghost as a free setup opportunity and threaten to sweep through the entire team. Faster Setup Pokemon: Setup threats such as Swords Dance Koraidon, Calm Mind Miraidon, and Swords Dance Zacian-C completely obliterate Arceus-Ghost and can even use it as a safe opportunity to set up, as it cannot threaten to KO them outright. Arceus: Thanks to its immunity to Ghost-type Judgment, Arceus can safely switch into Arceus-Ghost and threaten it with Taunt or use it as setup fodder for Swords Dance."

    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Besides Koraidon and Miraidon, Arceus-Ground is perhaps the most terrifying setup sweeper in Ubers. Strong Ground-type STAB moves in combination with Rock-type coverage makes switching into Arceus-Ground a challenge in a tier where Ground-type checks are few and far between, demolishing many tier staples such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Ho-Oh. Arceus-Ground can also take hits with relative ease thanks to its good bulk and the lack of super effective coverage against it, allowing it to boost multiple times. Arceus-Ground is one of the few checks to Miraidon in the tier and the only one that packs significant offensive pressure. Arceus-Ground is held back by its four-moveslot syndrome and inability to check Miraidon very reliably by itself, as it lacks the raw bulk that Ting-Lu has and the ability to run Heavy-Duty Boots that Clodsire provides. Additionally, other Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water may provide better defensive utility, while Arceus can give great revenge killing support with Extreme Speed. Overall, Arceus-Ground is a staple of offense and balance structures alike. Dragon Dance turns Arceus-Ground into a devastating wallbreaker that can also clean up weakened teams with ease. Stone Edge hits Ho-Oh and does good damage to most Ground-immune targets like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Taunt prevents status from Pokemon like Skeledirge, Giratina-O, and Gliscor and is useful to prevent Whirlwind from Ting-Lu. Recover is highly recommended on non-hyper offense teams to provide Arceus-Ground with more longevity, which is critical for checking Miraidon in the long term. Ice Beam can more directly deal with Gliscor and Landorus-T, which often pivot in on Arceus-Ground. Tera Ground is usually preferred, as the power boost can be critical for Arceus-Ground to get past Pokemon like Koraidon and bulky Kyogre that otherwise survive a +1 Earthquake. Tera Ghost has some utility providing Fighting and Normal immunities, which prevents common revenge kill options like Choice Scarf Koraidon's Low Kick and Extreme Killer Arceus's Extreme Speed. The EVs outspeed all base 90 Speed Pokemon, with the rest dumped into HP. This set is a mainstay on hyper offense teams thanks to its strong wallbreaking power and ability to reasonably deal with Miraidon. It appreciates fellow setup sweepers such as Scale Shot Koraidon, Double Dance Miraidon, Zacian-C, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM that can help it break through defensive cores. Hyper offense leads such as Deoxys-S and Glimmora pair well with Arceus-Ground, helping it net KOs easier without the need to Terastallize; two layers of Spikes give it a good chance to OHKO Koraidon, and Stealth Rock helps damage Landorus-T and Gliscor, which may try to pivot around Arceus-Ground. Additionally, Grimmsnarl's dual screens support has notably potent synergy with Arceus-Ground, as its great bulk becomes even better, allowing it to get multiple Dragon Dance boosts with ease. If Arceus-Ground is on a more balanced team, another Miraidon check like Ting-Lu or specially defensive Gliscor is appreciated, as this Arceus-Ground set is not reliable at handling Miraidon multiple times by itself. Calm Mind Arceus-Ground is an extremely potent win condition that doubles in use as a good Miraidon check. It has more bulk than Clodsire while also having the reliable recovery that Ting-Lu lacks, giving it a distinct niche. Calm Mind and an Electric immunity makes this set one of the few Pokemon in the game that can defeat Double Dance Miraidon one-on-one. Furthermore, thanks to its powerful Ground-type Judgment, specially defensive walls such as Eternatus and Clodsire are unable to freely use Toxic, and Power Gem heavily discourages Ho-Oh from forcing it out with Whirlwind. This makes Arceus-Ground the least reliant on using Tera to sweep successfully out of all the Arceus formes. Ice Beam is a fine option over Power Gem to more effectively deal with Gliscor and attempt to freeze foes. Tera Fairy is mainly chosen for helping against Miraidon which may otherwise break through Arceus-Ground, although its added resistance to Koraidon's Low Kick is appreciated. Tera Steel also helps against Miraidon, with the distinction of providing a Poison immunity that may be useful against specially defensive Gliscor and Eternatus. The set's EVs maximize special bulk, which is critical for handling Miraidon, and outspeed all neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon. More offensive EV spreads are possible, although they require further teammate support for Miraidon. 132 HP / 252 SpA / 124 Spe with a Modest nature gives Arceus-Ground maximum offensive output, notably giving it a chance to OHKO Ho-Oh at +1, while outspeeding all positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon. 248 HP / 144 Def / 100 SpA / 16 Spe allow Arceus-Ground to 2HKO Clodsire unboosted and take two Flare Blitzes from Koraidon, giving it some physically defensive utility and making it harder to revenge kill. Arceus-Ground is extremely hard to stop late-game once its checks have been chipped down. Opposing Calm Mind Arceus formes often lose in a one-on-one battle thanks to this set's higher special investment, leaving only checks like Ting-Lu, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh that can phaze or overpower Arceus-Ground. Gliscor is an excellent teammate, as it patches up the lack of entry hazard support that forgoing Ting-Lu or Clodsire causes. In addition, Gliscor is a great switch-in to Ting-Lu, Ho-Oh, and Choice Scarf Koraidon, allowing it to use Toxic and set hazards early-game to great effect. Skeledirge is a fairly solid check to Scale Shot Koraidon that loves Arceus-Ground taking on Miraidon, which commonly switches in on it. Knock Off Necrozma-DM is a great lure for Kyogre and Ho-Oh, as getting rid of their Heavy-Duty Boots makes them much more susceptible to entry hazard damage. Eternatus can switch in on Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Grass and force them out with Toxic while also absorbing the Toxic Spikes that Arceus-Ground is vulnerable to. Miraidon is a good offensive partner for damaging Ting-Lu over time and switching in easily on Ho-Oh. A support set featuring moves like Thunder Wave, Will-O-Wisp, and Stealth Rock is possible, although it has some issues. Calm Mind provides a way to handle Double Dance Miraidon and makes Arceus-Ground a great cleaner, so it generally has more utility. In addition, Ground-type Judgment has several immunities in the tier, forcing you to choose between Arceus-Ground being hard walled or having more support moves available. A physically defensive set of 52 HP / 232 Def / 24 SpD with a Relaxed nature with Earthquake / Ice Beam / Stealth Rock / Recover is an option, although not often seen due to the plethora of defensive Ground-types in the tier. Ground-immune Pokemon: Giratina-O is one of the most complete checks to Arceus-Ground, as it can tank Stone Edge and Power Gem very well and threaten back with Will-O-Wisp, Dragon Tail, and Poltergeist. Landorus-T is a severe annoyance to the Dragon Dance set thanks to Intimidate, though it must watch out for Ice Beam. Gliscor can rack up damage on predicted Taunts by using Earthquake and can cripple Calm Mind Arceus-Ground with Toxic. Water-types: Bulky Kyogre sets tank any hit outside of a Tera Ground-boosted Earthquake and OHKO back, and it can go head-to-head with Calm Mind sets. Arceus-Water can similarly take any hit and severely damage Arceus-Ground with a super effective Judgment. Both must be careful of Calm Mind Arceus-Ground should it choose to Terastallize. Arceus-Grass: While rare, Arceus-Grass is the best check to Arceus-Ground in the game, easily taking any hit and doing extreme damage back with Grass Knot. Phazing: While they usually prefer to save their health for other threats like Miraidon and offensive Ho-Oh, both Ting-Lu and Ho-Oh can phaze Arceus-Ground in a pinch, as Ting-Lu can tank any hit thrown at it and Ho-Oh survives Power Gem at +1. Chip Damage: Arceus-Ground is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and status effects, jeopardizing its ability to attain multiple boosts as well as check Miraidon."

    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Arceus-Water is a solid defensive pick in Ubers, being one of the best answers to hard-to-check threats like Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, offensive Ho-Oh, Calyrex-I, Chien-Pao, Rayquaza, and Kyogre lacking Thunder. While it cannot compare to Arceus-Fairy in terms of taking on Koraidon, its resistance to Flare Blitz makes Arceus-Water a decent check in combination with other Koraidon switch-ins like Landorus-T. Arceus-Water can spread burns and paralysis with relative freedom, as it discourages Ground-types from switching in and the use of Tera Fire, not to mention that Calm Mind makes it a decent setup sweeper in combination with massive Defense investment. The most notable flaw of Arceus-Water is that it invites arguably the most threatening Pokemon in the tier, Miraidon, to come in with little risk; it is also quite passive and vulnerable to being worn down over time. While Judgment has decent neutral coverage by itself, it's weakened by how common sun is, so a secondary attack is necessary. Ice Beam is usually chosen as the best option to hit switch-ins like Miraidon and Clodsire. Dragon Tail can rack up entry hazard damage and has good synergy with Arceus-Water's status options. Since Arceus-Water can often check most threats without status, Calm Mind is a great option to turn it into a solid win condition. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can cripple Ho-Oh and Tera Fire users like Koraidon, Necrozma-DM, and Calyrex-I, making it a safe option. Will-O-Wisp may be used to more solidly check physical threats. Do note that Tera Fire can put a stop to this, especially from Koraidon, which doesn't mind taking Judgment in the sun; therefore, Dragon Tail is highly recommended for Will-O-Wisp sets to mitigate this risk. Tera Fairy allows Arceus-Water to take boosted Scale Shot from Koraidon, while Tera Poison is possible on Calm Mind sets to prevent Arceus-Water from being crippled by Toxic from Eternatus, Clodsire, and specially defensive Gliscor. The EVs maximize Defense investment while outspeeding all neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon. Arceus-Water works best when it has other walls to back it up against powerful wallbreakers like Koraidon. Landorus-T has fantastic synergy with Arceus-Water, checking Pokemon like Zacian-C and Zekrom, and its Intimidate and Rocky Helmet support makes Koraidon much easier to handle. Necrozma-DM can check Zacian-C and Kyurem-B and appreciates Arceus-Water handling Calyrex-I. Ting-Lu is the most solid switch-in to Miraidon that often come in on Arceus-Water, making it a highly recommended teammate. Meanwhile, Clodsire can absorb Toxic Spikes and check Miraidon and Kyogre. Miraidon can help against Kyogre sets that have Thunder while also bringing in Arceus-Water easily with U-turn. Skeledirge likes Arceus-Water dealing with Ho-Oh and can handle Koraidon and Zacian-C for it in return. Flutter Mane is a good offensive partner that forces difficult decisions on opposing Koraidon as to what move to choose; using anything but Flare Blitz allows Flutter Mane in for free, while Flare Blitz allows Arceus-Water to switch in easily. Dragon Dance sets are possible, but are too limited by Koraidon's sun and are generally outclassed by Extreme Killer Arceus and Arceus-Ground. Miraidon: Miraidon can come in quite easily, as it can stomach an Ice Beam without much worry and blow past even a boosted Arceus-Water. Poison: Eternatus and Clodsire can take even a boosted Ice Beam and immediately threaten Arceus-Water with Toxic, though they must be wary of Tera Poison. Specially defensive Gliscor is not OHKOed by Ice Beam or Judgment and thus can retaliate with Toxic. All of the aforementioned Pokemon can also set Toxic Spikes, which is devastating for Arceus-Water's longevity. Kyogre: Kyogre can switch in without too much worry and use Thunder or Thunder Wave, both of which can cripple Arceus-Water. However, Kyogre will lose to Calm Mind sets if it lacks Thunder. Arceus-Grass: Though rare, Arceus-Grass can boost alongside Arceus-Water and deal devastating damage at any time with Grass Knot. Sun: Though Koraidon itself prefers to not be on the field when Arceus-Water is, the sun that it brings cripples the damage output that Arceus-Water would normally provide."

  "Archaludon": {
    "name": "Archaludon",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Archaludon serves as a solid revenge killer and lure for threats like Hydreigon and Choice Specs Dragapult, which take advantage of Archaludon's defensive variant. Draco Meteor not only OHKOes these Dragon-types but is also powerful enough to OHKO Urshifu-R and Darkrai after minimal chip damage. Thunder Wave lets Archaludon limit threats such as Ogerpon-H, Keldeo, and Spectrier, preventing them from sweeping Steel teams. Flash Cannon OHKOes Iron Valiant and allows Archaludon to pick off Flutter Mane after some damage. Thunderbolt prevents Skarmory and Moltres from gaining free entry into Archaludon. Alternatively, Foul Play OHKOes Ceruledge and Ogerpon-H at +2 after Stealth Rock damage. Since Choice Scarf Archaludon relies on surprise to bait the opponent, entry hazards need to be off the field to avoid revealing that it is not carrying Leftovers. Iron Treads can handle this with Rapid Spin and also serves as a fast teammate that deals with Landorus and Hisuian Goodra for Archaludon. Alternatively, a Choice Band Iron Treads set can be used to remove Iron Hands, Okidogi, and opposing Archaludon while also weakening defensive cores of Ground, Dark, and Poison teams for Archaludon to exploit. Gholdengo benefits from Archaludon providing speed control, allowing it to use more a powerful set like Choice Specs or Nasty Plot to punch holes in opposing teams, overwhelming Gliscor and Hisuian Goodra. In return, Gholdengo provides a Fighting-immune teammate and deals with Iron Hands and Galarian Slowking. Air Balloon Heatran can check most Gouging Fire variants and sets Stealth Rock, which this Archaludon cannot. Heatran also deals with Ceruledge once its Air Balloon is popped, covering for Archaludon's inability to check it without defensive investment. Skarmory provides a Ground-immune, sets entry hazards, and serves as a wincon once special attackers like Dragapult and Hydreigon are baited and removed by Archaludon. Scizor and Bisharp appreciate Archaludon's ability to keep their checks, such as Skarmory, Moltres, Gouging Fire, and Hydreigon, at low HP or eliminated, and in return, they can clean through opposing teams and remove Flutter Mane and Gholdengo with their priority moves, respectively. Corviknight is an alternative Ground-immune teammate that provides Defog and pivoting in U-turn, which facilitates Archaludon's ability to tear through Dragon teams. Archaludon is the defensive glue for Steel teams, taking on threats such as Gouging Fire, Ogerpon-W, and Ceruledge. Draco Meteor lets Archaludon pressure Gouging Fire and gain the upper hand against Dragon teams. Body Press complements Draco Meteor well by heavily damaging Hisuian Goodra, the main check to Draco Meteor for Dragon teams. Aside from this, Body Press also weakens Steel- and Normal-types such as Heatran and Blissey, which can comfortably take Draco Meteor. The synergy between Body Press and Stamina allows Archaludon to handle bulky threats like Ting-Lu and Gliscor effectively. Thunder Wave slows down threats like the Ogerpon formes, Keldeo, and Iron Valiant, which Archaludon can survive a hit from but cannot OHKO back, and also lets Archaludon take further advantage of the switches it forces. Stealth Rock lets Archaludon capitalize on forcing out physical attackers like Dragonite and Iron Boulder further. Alternatively, one can forgo Stealth Rock to broaden the number of targets Archaludon checks. Foul Play enables Archaludon to OHKO Ceruledge and dissuade Dragon Dance Dragonite from boosting further. It can also use Thunderbolt to revenge kill Azumarill and dissuade Skarmory from setting entry hazards against it. 52 Speed EVs let Archaludon outspeed Jolly Azumarill while using the remaining EVs to maximize Archaludon‘s bulk. Archaludon's lackluster Special Defense is its glaring weakness, so specially defensive teammates like Hisuian Goodra, Heatran, and Empoleon are appreciated. Hisuian Goodra can trade blows with Raging Bolt and Primarina; Heatran provides an immunity to Fire moves that lets it check Volcarona and deal with Gholdengo, Spectrier, and Flutter Mane; and Empoleon provides Stealth Rock, checks Walking Wake and Heatran, and is able to Knock Off Choice Specs from Hydreigon. Gholdengo provides a Fighting immunity, prevents opposing teams from removing Stealth Rock that Archaludon sets, and can choose to utilize a specially defensive spread to improve the matchup against Dragapult and Keldeo. Gholdengo and Heatran can also choose to run more offensive sets, with Air Balloon Heatran helping Archaludon check Gouging Fire and Nasty Plot Gholdengo dealing with Ursaluna-B and Iron Valiant. Skarmory is a physical wall that complements Archaludon, as it swaps into predicted Ground-type moves from Excadrill and Great Tusk, sets Spikes to pair with Archaludon's Stealth Rock, and has Whirlwind to further chip down opposing teams and to phaze IronPress users like Zamazenta and opposing Skarmory. Bisharp appreciates Archaludon's ability to check Gouging Fire and Encore Ogerpon-W, as well as the entry hazards Archaludon sets to set up and attempt to sweep Dragon, Water, and Dark teams late-game. Iron Treads can soft check Raging Bolt, remove entry hazards, pivot, and outspeed and remove Landorus and Garchomp with Ice Spinner in a pinch. Corviknight is an alternative Ground-immune teammate that loves Archaludon's ability to put a stop to Gouging Fire and Ogerpon-W, potentially overpowering Dragon and Water teams afterward when using a Bulk Up set. Archaludon bridges the gap between offense and defense with its well-rounded stats that let it beat Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Dragon Dance Dragapult, and Bisharp for Dragon teams. Body Press pairs well with Stamina and lets Archaludon check Bisharp and Weavile. Flash Cannon pelts Fairy- and Ice-types like Hatterene and Froslass coming in on it, and it also deals enough damage to knock out Iron Valiant in a worst-case scenario. Stealth Rock chips down opposing teams and provides Dragon teams with more breathing room against threats like Choice Band Chien-Pao and Swords Dance Ceruledge. The final moveslot is highly flexible and is mainly dependent on Archaludon's teammates. Protect is the most consistent choice, letting Archaludon rack up more Leftovers recovery and scout opposing Choice item users like Excadrill and Enamorus, while Draco Meteor lets Archaludon excel in the Dragon matchup, punishing physical attackers like Gouging Fire and physically inclined Dragapult that cannot deal with Archaludon. On the other hand, Roar takes advantage of Archaludon's ability to force out most physical attackers and defensive Pokemon and lets Archaludon further wear down opposing teams. Thunderbolt hits Skarmory and Toxapex, which would otherwise take advantage of Archaludon by setting up entry hazards, and chunks Azumarill enough to deter it from using Belly Drum. Stamina punishes weak attacks such as pivoting moves from Corviknight, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. The Defense boost also lets Archaludon overpower Ground-type attackers such as Gliscor lacking Swords Dance and Ting-Lu that cannot break through it after a few boosts. 56 Speed EVs let Archaludon outspeed Jolly Azumarill, allowing Archaludon to check these threats readily. The remaining EVs are used to make Archaludon as physically bulky as possible, notably allowing it to survive an OHKO from Choice Band Excadrill's Earthquake. Although Archaludon can take physical hits with ease, it has trouble taking neutral special attacks, as it is 2HKOed by Choice Scarf Iron Valiant's Moonblast and Dragapult's Draco Meteor and outright OHKOed by Choice Specs Flutter Mane and Hydreigon. Because of this, Hisuian Goodra is a great teammate, as it sponges these attacks reasonably well, forming a great defensive core with Archaludon. Alternatively, Gouging Fire can be used as a specially defensive pivot to absorb various Fairy- and Ice-type special attacks from Enamorus and Greninja, and it also deals with Gholdengo for Archaludon. Dragapult is immune to Fighting and can reasonably deal with Iron Defense Zamazenta if using a Hex set, OHKO Flutter Mane and non-Choice Scarf Iron Valiant if using Choice Specs, and pivot in Archaludon against walls it can take advantage of like Ting-Lu and Blissey. Baxcalibur deals with Landorus and Enamorus with Ice Shard, and it can utilize a Dragon Dance or Swords Dance set to break down types such as Poison and Ground that Archaludon struggles with. Latias is immune to Ground thanks to Levitate, deals with Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Okidogi, and provides Healing Wish, which gives Archaludon a second chance at walling Chien-Pao and Meowscarada. Dragonite is immune to Ground by typing instead of ability, which helps against Excadrill. It can also make use of Multiscale to let it take on and revenge kill Enamorus and Ceruledge in a pinch, and it can utilize a Choice Band set to clean opposing teams with Extreme Speed after Archaludon has chipped them down. Raging Bolt deals with pesky Water- and Flying-types like Primarina and Enamorus with Thunderclap and also benefits from Archaludon's Stealth Rock. Flash Cannon lets Archaludon deal with Iron Valiant and Enamorus, while also providing a consistent source of damage against Gliscor. However, Archaludon's teammates, like Gholdengo and Iron Treads, usually have these these threats covered, and they would rather Archaludon check Ceruledge or Azumarill instead. 44 Special Defense EVs may be used to let Archaludon avoid an OHKO from Choice Specs Flutter Mane while still making it very likely that Archaludon survives Choice Band Excadrill's Earthquake. 56 Special Attack EVs can be invested to OHKO Enamorus with Flash Cannon, as Archaludon survives any one of Enamorus moves once, but decreased Defense investment can impair Archaludon's ability to be a strong physical wall. Archaludon has a variety of options for its fourth move, namely Thunder Wave to punish switch-ins like Primarina and Volcarona, Dragon Pulse to consistently damage opposing Dragon-types, and Metal Burst to get a surprise OHKO on threats like Flutter Mane, Ceruledge, and Hoopa-U. However, all these moves are usually inferior to the above-mentioned options."

  "Arghonaut": {
    "name": "Arghonaut",
    "text": "Arghonaut is one of the best defensive pivots in CAP thanks to Unaware, strong defenses and a fantastic support movepool. Circle Throw phazes setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Volcarona, and Stratagem. It also forces out Equilibra, the tier's premier spinner, making it easier to stack layers of Spikes. Knock Off threatens the Ghost-types that try to switch into Circle Throw such as Dragapult and Gholdengo and puts pressure on foes that rely on Heavy-Duty Boots to switch into entry hazards such as Venomicon, Volcarona, and Dragonite. 248 HP and 224 Defense EVs with an Impish nature guarantee that Arghonaut survives +2 Miasmaw's five-hit Scale Shot, Hemogoblin's Bitter Blade into Tera Fairy-boosted Extreme Speed, and Kingambit's Tera Blast Fairy with five Supreme Overlord boosts. The remaining 36 EVs are put into Special Defense to better tank special attacks, allowing Arghonaut to survive Krilowatt's Surf and Thunderbolt combination, as well as avoiding being 2HKOed by its Tera Water-boosted Surf after Arghonaut has Terastallized. While Leftovers gives Arghonaut much-appreciated passive recovery, Heavy-Duty Boots can be run instead to ignore Spikes at the cost of being more reliant on Recover. Tera Fairy allows Arghonaut to completely change its defensive profile, letting it beat Hemogoblin, Tera Flying Roaring Moon, and Iron Valiant while stopping Miasmaw's Scale Shot. Arghonaut fits best on balance and stall teams, checking most setup sweepers and gaining momentum through the combination of Circle Throw and Spikes. Stealth Rock setters such as Clefable, Venomicon, and Heatran can aid in stacking hazards. Venomicon in particular is a great partner, taking defensive pressure off Arghonaut by checking Fairy-types like Hemogoblin and Iron Valiant as well as offensive Grass-types like Ogerpon-W and Meowscarada. Bulky Ground-types such as Equilibra, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor can help against offensive Electric-types such as Krilowatt, Caribolt, and Raging Bolt. The former two also help check opposing Psychic-types, while Gliscor can act as a solid Knock Off switch-in once its Poison Heal has activated. Equilibra can also remove hazards with Rapid Spin to keep Leftovers Arghonaut as healthy as possible. Offensive pivots such as Dragapult, Krilowatt, and Rillaboom appreciate the Spikes support and item removal that Arghonaut provides. A set consisting of Bulk Up / Knock Off / Circle Throw / Recover with an EV spread of 248 HP / 224 Def / 18 SpD / 12 Spe can be utilized to turn Arghonaut into a sort of setup sweeper that outspeeds uninvested Mollux, but not only does it loses the mirror even harder, but it also requires the team support Arghonaut would usually provide. Ice Punch can be run to hit Gliscor and Landorus-T, but the utility of Arghonaut's other moves makes it niche at best. Toxic can be used over Spikes if there's another setter on the team, but Venomicon remains a hard counter. Tera Poison is an option that allows Arghonaut to be immune to Toxic and resist Fairy, but keeping the Psychic weakness and obtaining a Ground weakness is not worth it. Finally, Covert Cloak allows Arghonaut to best Garganacl and become a more consistent switch-in to Heatran, Mollux, and Pecharunt, but provides very little otherwise. Fairy-types: Offensive Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin, Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Enamorus all threaten Arghonaut and have ways to deal with it even if it Terrastalizes. Defensive Fairy-types like Clefable and Cresceidon both can similarly force it out. Only Iron Valiant and Clefable want to switch into Knock Off, however. Flying-types: Venomicon, Zapdos, Gliscor, and Tomohawk can all shrug off Arghonaut's attacks and threaten it with either a strong STAB move or their utility options. The former two do not appreciate losing their item and so can't mindlessly switch in, and Gliscor's Poison Heal must be activated before it can switch in freely. Skarmory can't immediately threaten Arghonaut but can phaze Arghonaut out with Whirlwind. Venomicon-E threatens huge damage even after Arghonaut Terastallizes. Tera Flying Acrobatics Roaring Moon similarly threatens to KO Arghonaut after minimal damage. Electric-types: Krilowatt, Caribolt, Raging Bolt, and Plasmanta can all hit Arghonaut super effectively, with Plasmanta even being able to beat it after Terastallizing. However, Arghonaut can take the others on after it Terastallizes into the Fairy-type, and Krilowatt is scared of switching into Arghonaut, as it gets crippled by Knock Off. Grass-types: Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Meowscarada all threaten to OHKO Arghonaut and can pivot out with U-turn on a predicted Tera Fairy. They also all can remove Arghonaut's item with their own Knock Off, making it easier to pick off by their teammates. Serperior threatens huge damage with Leaf Storm despite Arghonaut's Unaware and can even paralyze it with Glare. Status: Gliscor, Snaelstrom, and Pecharunt can all badly poison Arghonaut, while Cresceidon, Gholdengo, and Zapdos can paralyze it through Thunder Wave or Static, making it significantly more passive. Similarly, Heatran, Rotom-W, Mollux, and Volcanion all threaten to burn it, making Arghonaut deal pitiful damage. All of the above also empower Hex users like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and the aforementioned Pecharunt."

  "Ariados": {
    "name": "Ariados",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1 point Overview: Ariados has three traits that cause it to get drafted: it has Sticky Web, it has Toxic Spikes, and it's a grounded Poison-type. Unfortunately, it doesn't have very much else going for it. Its decent utility movepool is held back by its mediocre bulk, typing, and Speed. On the bright side, its unassuming appearance might make opponents less likely to prepare for its tricks. Entry Hazard Lead: The most common task for Ariados is that of a sacrificial lead, attempting to set a Sticky Web and perhaps some Toxic Spikes against an unprepared team. A Focus Sash makes the set more consistent against lead attackers, and it can tickle the foe with a Shadow Sneak or Sucker Punch before going down. Utility: Ariados can also seek out mid-game opportunities to set entry hazards against more passive foes. It can usually survive one or two hits with the correct defensive investment, and some foes may not have the coverage they need to threaten it. As a result, it can set entry hazards and then pressure foes with moves like Knock Off or a deceptively strong Megahorn. Primary STAB Moves: Megahorn, Poison Jab, Lunge, Skitter Smack, Leech Life Setup Moves: Agility, Swords Dance Utility Moves: Sticky Web, Toxic Spikes, Knock Off, Foul Play, Baton Pass, Toxic, Toxic Thread Coverage: Sucker Punch, Shadow Sneak, Smart Strike Endure: Endure can be used with a Custap Berry to set Sticky Web while facing a faster foe or potentially end a foe's sweep with another move. Focus Sash: Focus Sash keeps lead Ariados alive so it can set Sticky Web more easily. Heavy-Duty Boots: Heavy-Duty Boots helps Ariados switch in more often to set its own entry hazards and clear Toxic Spikes. Mental Herb: If the opponent seems likely to use Taunt to stop Sticky Web, Mental Herb can be used to deal with it at the cost of being vulnerable to turn 1 OHKOs. Choice Scarf: Most foes easily outspeed Ariados, so a slightly faster spider can surprise the opponent and set Sticky Web before fainting. Resistance Berries: Resistance Berries can enhance Araidos's effective bulk against foes that lack better ways to hit it. For example, a Payapa Berry can keep it safe against Iron Valiant and allow it to set Sticky Web or strike back with Poison Jab. Custap Berry: Custap Berry can grant an opportunity to set Sticky Web mid-game if paired with Endure. Ariados should not be a Tera Captain. Its stats are too low and there are far too many better options. Ariados should always be taken at the end of a draft to add a cheap Sticky Web setter. It fits well with the following picks. Wallbreakers: Offensive Pokemon with mediocre Speed like Chi-Yu and Urshifu-S become significantly more threatening with Sticky Web support. Bulkier wallbreakers like Palafin and Iron Hands appreciate its ability to clear Toxic Spikes as well. Ghost-type Pokemon: Ghost-types can block Rapid Spin, making it easier to keep Sticky Web in play even after Ariados faints. Gholdengo fits this role especially well, since it also blocks Defog. Entry Hazard Removal: Ariados's main job is to set entry hazards, and a reliable Rapid Spin or Defog user can make it feel like a wasted slot. Taunt: Taunt prevents Ariados from using its beloved entry hazard moves, and most Taunt users can outspeed it. Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon: Ariados has no way to deal meaningful damage to many Pokemon, mostly the Poison- and Steel-types that resist both of its STAB attacks. These Pokemon can easily set up on it or use a move to prevent Sticky Web."

  "Armarouge": {
    "name": "Armarouge",
    "text": "The incredible power of Armor Cannon makes Armarouge a terrifying foe in the RU tier, often threatening a KO whenever it enters the field. With its excellent STAB combination that hits most of the metagame, Weak Armor that constantly deters weak physical moves like U-turn and Rapid Spin, and the physical bulk to make use of it, Armarouge can serve as both a wallbreaker and sweeper simultaneously. Armarouge is unique among the Psychic-types in the tier due to its ability to threaten Steel-types like Jirachi, Magnezone, and Registeel with Armor Cannon. Armarouge's drawbacks, however, are evident; its Speed is lower than much of the tier, allowing many Pokemon like Basculegion-F, Gengar, and Salamence to outspeed it prior to Weak Armor's activation, and its ability to take special attacks is poor. Its weakness to Stealth Rock and the combined Defense drops from both Weak Armor and Armor Cannon can cause damage to add up quickly, resulting in Armarouge being unable to survive subsequent attacks from revenge killers and bulky Pokemon. Armarouge is a devastating special attacker, capable of breaking holes in teams or taking advantage of opposing physical attackers to boost its Speed with Weak Armor in order to sweep. Armarouge particularly excels against Cyclizar, the most common form of entry hazard removal in the tier, due to the minimal damage received and the fact that most of Cyclizar's moves will activate Weak Armor. Psyshock targets the weaker Defense of opposing Pokemon such as Chansey and Assault Vest Cyclizar. Energy Ball is used to hit Water-types with high Defense like Slowbro and Suicune. Tera Fairy provides valuable resistances to Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Slither Wing's First Impression, as well as allowing Armarouge to shrug off Knock Off from Krookodile, Mienshao, and Galarian Zapdos. Tera Fairy also grants an immunity to Cyclizar's Dragon Tail, preventing Armarouge from being phazed out. Tera Grass grants resistances to Barraskewda's and Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet, Empoleon's Surf, and Krookodile's Earthquake. This also boosts the damage of Energy Ball, allowing Armarouge to threaten OHKOs on Krookodile, Terrakion, and Hippowdon. Calm Mind Armarouge is most comfortable on balance and offense teams, where it can use its wallbreaking ability to open up holes for its team to exploit or threaten a late-game sweep. Pivot support from VoltTurn users such as Cyclizar, Magnezone, and Hisuian Zoroark are important to get Armarouge into favorable matchups against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Amoonguss while preserving its HP. These Pokemon can also bait out weak Knock Off from Cyclizar and Reuniclus, easily allowing Weak Armor to activate. Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos invite physical walls like Hippowdown and Slowbro in, which Armarouge can take advantage of. Opposing special attackers like Gengar, Mew, and Salamence outspeed and threaten Armarouge, so allies like Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi, respectively, can switch into their attacks for it. Priority moves are one of the most reliable answers to Armarouge after Weak Armor activates, so pairing it with Psychic Surge Indeedee can nullify this weakness with the added benefit of empowering its Psychic-type moves. Weakness Policy Armarouge is a naturally potent wallbreaker and sweeper that can immediately chunk holes in the opposing team thanks to its excellent STAB combination and decent bulk. Armarouge can use the combination of Endure and Weakness Policy to flip situations around at the drop of a hat and threaten a devastating sweep. Armor Cannon is the centerpiece of Armarouge's arsenal as a wallbreaker due to its high Base Power and its drawbacks made negligible by having Endure as an option. Stored Power can deal incredible amounts of damage after a Weakness Policy and Weak Armor activation, with the drawback of initially being very weak. Expanding Force is an option on Psychic Terrain teams that can OHKO most non-resistant foes in the tier while Psychic Terrain is active and is still a decently powerful attack otherwise. Energy Ball provides Armarouge with coverage that is essential for dealing with Water-types such as Slowbro and Suicune. Calm Mind is an optional setup move that allows Armarouge to capitalize on Pokemon that cannot deal much damage to it like Cyclizar, Fezandipiti, and Galarian Weezing and keeps it from being dependent on Weakness Policy for strengthening its attacks. Weak Armor allows Armarouge to outspeed a massive portion of the tier after surviving a physical attack, thus enabling it to act as an excellent late-game cleaner. A Timid nature ensures that Armarouge outspeeds even the fastest Choice Scarf users in the tier, such as Terrakion and Gengar, at +2. Tera Ground makes Armarouge immune to Sandstorm damage and also lets it deny Thunder Wave and Electric-type moves from Pokemon such as Magnezone, Jirachi, and Reuniclus, which gives it time to either setup further or pick up a KO. Tera Normal can be used to turn the tables on a Ghost-type revenge killer like Gengar or Mimikyu. Tera Psychic boosts the damage of Armarouge's strong Psychic-type attacks even further and is particularly useful in Psychic Terrain. Weakness Policy Armarouge fits well on hyper offense and offensive structures that appreciate a safety net that can revenge kill a Choice item user such as Galarian Zapdos or Krookodile if needed and possibly sweep in return. Armarouge can also cover the role of a wallbreaker and cleaner on balance structures that aim to gradually chip away at the opposing team due to its innate firepower and ability to quickly boost its Speed. Armarouge synergizes particularly well with Psychic Terrain and thus partners well with lead Psychic Surge Indeedee; not only does Psychic Terrain power up Armarouge's Psychic-type STAB attacks to unstoppable levels, it also stops Armarouge from being revenge killed with a priority move, which is often its biggest worry after a successful Endure. Armarouge often finds its itself lacking meaningful ways to deal with specially defensive walls such as Chansey, Umbreon, and Hisuian Goodra and therefore benefits from strong physical sweepers such as Swords Dance Terrakion and Shift Gear Revavroom and, on bulkier structures, wallbreakers such as Conkeldurr, as they can help to remove or deal large chunks of damage to Armarouge's checks. Armarouge benefits from hazard removal options such as Tidy Up Maushold and Rapid Spin Cyclizar, as they can prevent it from losing its health to entry hazard chip, thus keeping it from being dependent on Endure for surviving attacks. Armarouge works well with fast pivots such as Choice Scarf Jirachi and Cyclizar that can bait a Knock Off from weak physical attackers such as Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Chesnaught and use it against them to threaten a devastating sweep by activating Weakness Policy. Meteor Beam, alongside a Power Herb, can compress setup with a coverage option to hit Fire-types like Volcanion and opposing Armarouge into a single moveslot, with the drawback that this combination effectively limits Armarouge to three moveslots for the remainder of the game. Armarouge can effectively use Choice Specs for immediate power that can OHKO Cyclizar with Psyshock after Stealth Rock and 2HKO specially defensive Empoleon with Armor Cannon; it additionally allows Armarouge to use Trick to cripple the few walls that are able to switch into its attacks. Flash Fire can be used with Choice Specs, enabling absolutely nuclear Armor Cannons if positioned correctly, but using Flash Fire means that Gardevoir can Trace it to become immune, and Speed will remain an issue without Weak Armor. Iron Defense can offset the penalty of Weak Armor and give Armarouge the additional bulk to set up Calm Minds or activate Weakness Policy from powerful attacks like Crawdaunt's and Krookodile's Knock Off, all while further boosting Stored Power. Focus Blast can be used to hit opposing special walls like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon, but dropping Energy Ball leaves Armarouge weaker against Water-types like Slowbro. Destiny Bond allows Armarouge to get a surprise KO on a Pokemon that is bulky enough to survive its hits. Special Walls: Chansey, Umbreon, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra are all able to comfortably survive Armarouge's attacks and either heal off the damage or deal huge damage in return. With boosts from Calm Mind or Weakness Policy, Armarouge can use Psyshock to answer Chansey, particularly if its Eviolite has been removed, but the last three Pokemon either resist or are immune to Psyshock, meaning Armarouge has to brute force its way through their high Special Defense. Special Attackers: Special attackers like Azelf, Noivern, and Hisuian Zoroark not only target Armarouge's weaker Special Defense but fail to activate Weak Armor, meaning that Armarouge does not gain the crucial Speed advantage on the next turn. Even attacks from weaker Pokemon like Draco Meteor Cyclizar pose a threat. Priority: Armarouge's use of Weak Armor leaves it vulnerable to the many forms of physical priority moves in the tier, such as Slither Wing's First Impression, Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, and Aqua Jet from Barraskewda and Crawdaunt. Even resisted moves like Conkeldurr's Mach Punch can deal significant damage after Defense drops from Weak Armor and Armor Cannon, meaning that while these Pokemon are still in the game, Armarouge can struggle to sweep by itself. Endure sets are safe from First Impression, but unless Armarouge is used in Psychic Terrain, other priority users like Bisharp and Entei are extremely effective at revenge killing it."

Aqua Jet allows Azumarill to circumvent its vulnerable Speed tier, letting it hit threats like Thundurus-T, Excadrill, and Hisuian Arcanine without getting damaged by them first. Knock Off allows Azumarill to hit Slowking reliably while also hitting hard into switch-ins to its STAB moves, such as Volcanion, Sinistcha, and Pecharunt.

Choice Band works in tandem with Huge Power to boost Azumarill's Attack stat to absurdly high levels, while Leftovers increases Azumarill's longevity. Tera Water boosts Azumarill's STAB Liquidation and Aqua Jet to even more absurd levels, notably guaranteeing an OHKO on Tornadus-T with Liquidation. Alternatively, Tera Steel can be used to resist Grass-type moves from foes like Hydrapple and Ogerpon-C, and Tera Electric can be used to resist Electric-type moves from foes like Zapdos and Thundurus-T, with the added bonus of also resisting the former's Hurricane and preventing Azumarill from being punished by Static. The second EV spread allows Azumarill to outspeed Skeledirge while giving it more bulk to better check Pokemon like Keldeo and Greninja. Azumarill fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to break massive holes through teams while maintaining an aggressive, fast-paced style to offset Azumarill's low Speed and lack of defensive presence overall compared to other Water-types. Azumarill can easily be worn down by entry hazards, so Excadrill makes for a great partner to remove the hazards that plague it. Azumarill's biggest counter is Toxapex, which can only be hit by Knock Off that Toxapex shrugs off anyway, so ways to pressure it with Pokemon such as the aforementioned Excadrill, Zapdos, Latios, and Okidogi are essential. Other bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Rotom-W, and Volcanion prevent Azumarill from locking into Liquidation or Aqua Jet, so Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Zarude can help handle them. Lokix makes a great partner for Azumarill, acting as a secondary revenge killer to handle threats like Scizor and Latios that Azumarill cannot. Azumarill also struggles against Grass-types like Sinistcha and Ogerpon, so Pokemon like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Scizor are helpful teammates, though the former two struggle against Ogerpon-C. All of these Pokemon also provide useful pivot support to bring Azumarill in against many foes like Hisuian Arcanine, Rhyperior, Skeledirge, and Ursaluna to wallbreak. Belly Drum Azumarill serves as a phenomenal setup sweeper on hyper offense teams that is able to KO most Pokemon that do not resist Water with +6 Aqua Jet outright or after slight chip, such as Tornadus-T, offensive Zapdos, and Cobalion. It is also a dangerous wallbreaker that annihilates slower counterplay. Azumarill is vital in providing natural defensive utility against certain sets of Latios and Greninja, in addition to being a countermeasure for hyper offense teams against the sand archetype. Play Rough enables it to KO Water-resistant Pokemon such as Hydrapple and Latios as well as beefier neutral targets like Mandibuzz and Slowking. Knock Off serves as an alternative damage option to hit Toxapex and Pecharunt, 2HKO Skeledirge, and be a more reliable way of taking out Slowking. Sitrus Berry is used to give Azumarill a much-needed health boost after using Belly Drum. The alternate EV spread lets Azumarill outspeed Skeledirge. Tera Water boosts damage from Aqua Jet, enabling it to OHKO Zapdos, as well as OHKOing Greninja and Latios after Stealth Rock. Tera Electric gives Azumarill the ability to set up on Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Thundurus-T. Both Tera types give Azumarill a Steel resistance, which is useful to set up on Scizor and Metagross. Alternatively, a Jolly nature could be run to outspeed threats such as Mandibuzz, Sinistcha, Metagross, and Pecharunt, but this comes at a cost, as the drop in the power of Aqua Jet is noticeable. Azumarill fits best on hyper offense teams as a late-game sweeper that can take down weakened teams with +6 Aqua Jet. Excadrill and Sandy Shocks provide a key role in breaking Ogerpon-C's Sturdy with entry hazards as well as getting Cobalion, Latios, and Greninja in range of +6 Aqua Jet. Thundurus-T and Ogerpon-C can pressure faster threats such as Rotom-W, Volcanion, and Tera Water Zapdos. Greninja and Bisharp are able to check Pecharunt and Sinistcha, both of which can check Azumarill. Sticky Web from Araquanid is able to slow down threats such as Sinistcha and Pecharunt, bringing them down to a speed where Adamant Azumarill can defeat them."

  "Banette": {
    "name": "Banette",
    "text": "Mega Banette cements itself as a niche offensive disruption tool for balance and offensive teams with its ability Prankster and its support movepool. Access to priority status moves allows it to wreak havoc when facing offensive Pokemon, such as being able to disrupt with Encore or burn Zamazenta, Ogerpon-W, and Mega Lopunny. It can also switch into status and Fighting-type moves and threaten an Encore or gain momentum against Pokemon such as Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Swords Dance Gliscor, as well as Zamazenta's Close Combat. Mega Banette is no slouch when it comes to offensive power either, as it's able to use its gargantuan Attack stat in combination with Poltergeist to deal immense damage to a majority of the metagame, picking up 2HKOs on most switch-ins that don't resist or aren't immune to Ghost, such as Ferrothorn, physically defensive Zapdos, and specially defensive Corviknight. Destiny Bond allows Mega Banette to force a trade even once it's threatened out, being able to deal with fast threats without priority moves like Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf users like Urshifu-S and Tapu Lele, or setup sweepers that have gotten out of hand such as Swords Dance Iron Boulder and Nasty Plot Darkrai. However, Mega Banette requires a large commitment from its teammates to be able to function, relying on them consistently bringing it in to make the most use of its supportive capabilities due to its lackluster bulk. It also heavily disincentivizes Knock Off, since Mega Banette relies on Poltergeist. Mega Banette fits best on teams that want to keep up offensive pressure as much as possible while also having a good stopgap for setup sweepers like Volcarona and Ogerpon-W. Good partners for it include bulky pivots such as Corviknight, Alomomola, and Galarian Slowking, as they afford it opportunities to threaten foes by using Encore. Additionally, it appreciates support from strong Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Urshifu-R to deal with Dark-types such as Mega Tyranitar, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile, which resist Poltergeist and are immune its status moves once Mega Evolved, and Garganacl, which effectively resists Poltergeist and is also immune to its status moves."

  "Barraskewda": {
    "name": "Barraskewda",
    "text": "With one of the fastest natural Speed tiers in the metagame, Barraskewda is an excellent pick for a wallbreaker that can easily pivot out of its checks with Flip Turn, dealing decent chip damage to most Pokemon, and clean up late-game with its stronger attacks. On rain teams, Barraskewda turns into an incredibly powerful threat that is practically impossible to outspeed thanks to Swift Swim. However, Barraskewda suffers from the presence of common Water-resistant Regenerator Pokemon like Slowbro and Amoonguss that can shut it down and render its attempts at wallbreaking useless. Barraskewda is also quite frail and can be easily forced out, which can end up giving strong wallbreakers such as Basculegion-F and Hisuian Lilligant more opportunities to blow holes in Barraskewda's team. Thus, Barraskewda often relies on offensive partners to break through its checks and counters and defensive ones to restrict opposing wallbreakers from taking advantage of it. Flip Turn is one Barraskewda's most important moves, as it gives it the ability to pivot out of unfavorable matchups and deal noticeable damage at the same time, especially if rain is active. Close Combat is essential coverage to threaten common Water-resistant or -immune targets such as Cyclizar, Wo-Chien, Empoleon, and Volcanion. Aqua Jet enables Barraskewda to pick off fast sweepers such as Weak Armor Armarouge and Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir and Krookodile after they are weakened. Crunch can serve as optional coverage to threaten some of Barraskewda's checks like Slowbro and Basculegion-F. Choice Band provides Barraskewda with much-needed offensive firepower that allows it to act as a more threatening wallbreaker. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to keep Barraskewda from falling in range of strong priority moves like Bisharp's Sucker Punch, although the loss in power is very noticeable. A Jolly nature allows Barraskewda to outspeed key targets such as Cyclizar and Noivern. An Adamant nature trades off some of its Speed for damage and is preferred on rain teams, as Swift Swim already boosts Barraskewda's Speed to incredible levels. Tera Water boosts the power of Barraskewda's STAB moves, which is often all it needs to clean up a chipped opposition. Tera Fighting is used to power up Close Combat, enabling Barraskewda to deal more damage to Water-immune or -resistant foes like Volcanion and Blastoise while also giving it useful resistances to U-turn and Dark-type moves. Tera Dark boosts the power of Crunch, which can allow Barraskewda to pick off Psychic-type Pokemon like Slowbro and Reuniclus after some chip damage and give it resistances to key priority moves like Shadow Sneak from Mimikyu and Sucker Punch from Bisharp. Barraskewda finds itself at home in offense structures that can utilize its Speed and power to create holes that can be taken advantage of by its partners. It pairs well with special wallbreakers like Gengar, Gardevoir, and Armarouge that can capitalize on Flip Turn giving them safe entry points against physically defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Chesnaught, and Amoonguss. On rain teams, Barraskewda synergizes well with other rain exploiters like Basculegion-F and Kingdra to overwhelm Water-resistant foes like Slowbro, Empoleon, and Salamence with brute force. Other pivots can form VoltTurn cores with Barraskewda that aim to accrue chip damage on the opposing team by safely switching in on each other's defensive checks, with strong options like Magnezone, Galarian Zapdos, and Slither Wing synergizing particularly well thanks to their ability to threaten defensive Water-types like Slowbro and Empoleon. Barraskewda appreciates the presence of defensive partners such as Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Chesnaught that can keep wallbreakers like Basculegion-F, Volcanion, and Hisuian Lilligant from dealing too much damage after forcing Barraskewda out. Choice Band Barraskewda often relies on entry hazard removal options such as Cyclizar and Galarian Weezing to prevent strong priority moves like Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Conkeldurr's Mach Punch from picking it off after some entry hazard chip. Barraskewda may opt for Psychic Fangs as a coverage move instead of Aqua Jet or Crunch to be able to threaten Amoonguss and Chesnaught. Life Orb is an option over Choice Band and Heavy-Duty Boots that takes away Barraskewda's reliance on predictions while still enabling it to deal quite a bit of damage; however, the recoil damage combined with entry hazard and Rocky Helmet chip will wear it down very quickly. Mystic Water is a safer alternative on rain teams that still improves Barraskewda's ability to spam its STAB moves. Water-types: Defensive Water-type Pokemon such as Slowbro and Suicune can easily come in on Barraskewda's STAB moves and proceed to take advantage of it by setting up or firing off a Scald. Thus, their presence on the opposing team can drastically dampen Barraskewda's ability to break walls. In addition, strong Water-types like Basculegion-F and Volcanion can turn Barraskewda into a wallbreaking opportunity. Grass-types: Defensive Grass-types like Chesnaught and Amoonguss take little damage from Barraskewda's attacks, easily heal up and at the same time deal decent chip damage to it by way of Rocky Helmet, thus decreasing Barraskewda's longevity at a cheap cost. Wo-Chien is able to shrug off most attacks from Barraskewda and its Water-type partners that utilize rain and strike back with Knock Off or Foul Play. Hisuian Lilligant can also take advantage of Barraskewda by using it as setup fodder. Choice Scarf users: The common presence of Choice Scarf users that can outspeed and capitalize on Barraskewda such as Gardevoir and Galarian Zapdos hinders its reliability as a fast pivot. Gardevoir in particular is incredibly threatening for rain teams due to its ability, Trace, copying the effects of Barraskewda's Swift Swim."

  "Basculegion": {
    "name": "Basculegion",
    "text": "Basculegion's solid Attack stat, supported by two amazing abilities and high-Base Power STAB moves, makes it one of the most potent wallbreakers available in the tier. An Adaptability-boosted Wave Crash is capable of doing immense damage to bulky walls like Registeel and Swampert and even gets good chip on bulky Water-resistant Pokemon like Milotic and Tsareena. Alternatively, Basculegion can opt for Swift Swim on rain teams, becoming an extremely menacing Pokemon that can outspeed and power through bulky and offensive teams alike. While not having much in terms of type coverage, Basculegion has access to a solid movepool. Most notably, access to Aqua Jet lets it act as a revenge killer, picking off faster Pokemon such as Mienshao and Gallade with ease. However, the lack of a reliable physical Ghost-type STAB move hurts Basculegion greatly, making it susceptible to Pokemon that it otherwise would have a chance against, namely bulky Water-types such as Vaporeon and Gastrodon. Additionally, Basculegion's Speed is rather average, leaving it susceptible to being revenge killed by common Pokemon such as Gallade and Brambleghast and Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Rotom-C, and Munkidori as well. Liquidation acts as recoil-free alternative to Wave Crash at the cost of lower power. This is especially useful late-game, where Basculegion can wreck through weakened foes while still maintaining some health as to not be too vulnerable to revenge killers. Alternatively, Aqua Jet has more use outside of rain, being a useful priority tool to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Mienshao, Talonflame, and Cinccino. For Basculegion's last move, it tends to opt for Tera Blast alongside Tera Ghost, as it gifts Basculegion a powerful and reliable physical Ghost-type STAB move to hit Water-resistant and -immune Pokemon like Vaporeon, Toxicroak, Milotic, and Tsareena. However, it forces Basculegion to Terastallize, so it can be off-putting at times as an option. Because of this, Psychic Fangs can be used as alternative to hit Vaporeon neutrally while also hitting checks like Toxicroak and Vileplume super effectively. Ice Fang is another option that hits Dragon- and Grass-types like Dragalge, Tsareena, and Vileplume attempting to switch into Basculegion's Water-type attacks. If not running Tera Blast, Tera Water can further boost Basculegion's already monstrous offensive profile, letting it 2HKO bulky Water-resistant Pokemon such as Dragalge, Vileplume, and Tsareena with Wave Crash. Choice Band Basculegion is a premier threat on rain teams thanks to its immense power and Swift Swim boosting its Speed. As a result, rain setters such as Klefki and Tornadus are necessary picks. In addition to setting rain, the former has access to a vast array of utility moves such as Thunder Wave, which cripples Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Inteleon, and Spikes, while the latter can use rain itself to break through Grass-types like Vileplume, Wo-Chien, and Tsareena. Other Swift Swim Pokemon such as Kingdra, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Ludicolo have solid synergy with Basculegion. Kingdra can overwhelm Vaporeon, Toxicroak, and Dragalge, making it less needed for Basculegion to Terastallize to hit these Pokemon. Hisuian Qwilfish can function as a late-game cleaner that appreciates Basculegion's insane wallbreaking letting it finish off games more easily, as it's able to finish off weakened foes. Ludicolo's Grass-type STAB moves and Ice-type coverage can be monumental in turning the tides against bulky Water-, Grass-, and Dragon- types like Gastrodon, Vaporeon, Vileplume, and Dragalge. Other entry hazard setters such as Flygon and Swampert make for good teammates, further bolstering Basculegion's wallbreaking capabilities. Aqua Jet gives Mystic Water sets a way to pick off faster Pokemon like Chandelure, Cinccino, and Mienshao, while Liquidation helps out Choice Scarf sets by providing a less risky version of Wave Crash with more PP and no recoil. Aqua Jet can even find use on Choice Scarf variants as a means to combat faster Choice Scarf users like Mienshao. Psychic Fangs provides solid coverage, hitting Poison-types that can take Water-type moves like Dragalge, Toxicroak, and Vileplume. Ice Fang instead targets Grass- and Dragon-types like Tsareena, Vileplume, Flygon, and Dragalge, albeit being weaker into the aforementioned Poison-type Pokemon. Mystic Water in tandem with Adaptability makes Basculegion's Water-type STAB moves extremely menacing while allowing it to switch its moves. This is further boosted by Tera Water, which makes Basculegion's Water-type attacks monstrously strong, doing immense damage to even the bulkiest of physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg. Alternatively, Choice Scarf patches up Basculegion's otherwise average Speed and makes it a formidable revenge killer in its own right. Despite this, Basculegion's average Speed stat prevents it from being consistent as a revenge killer, as other Choice Scarf users such as Flygon, Mienshao, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z can effectively outspeed and threaten it. Entry hazard setters like Flygon, Swampert, and Diancie can set up Stealth Rock and Spikes, whittling down foes for Basculegion to more easily overwhelm. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Cinccino, Talonflame, and Tsareena is heavily appreciated, increasing Basculegion's longevity and making it more capable offensively in the late-game. Basculegion tends to draw in bulky Water- and Grass-types like Vaporeon, Vileplume, Gastrodon, and Tsareena. As a result, offensive Pokemon that can capitalize on these foes, namely Toxicroak, Incineroar, Rotom-C, and Staraptor, can form potent wallbreaking cores with Basculegion. Additionally, the last three Pokemon can reliably bring Basculegion in with their pivot moves, giving Basculegion an easier time entering battle. Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, Scrafty, and Bombirdier can counteract opposing Dark- and Ghost-types and use their presence as an opportunity to generate offensive momentum through pivoting and wearing down foes over time with Knock Off and, in the case of the first two, status. Setup Pokemon that can boost Speed such as Dragon Dance Flygon and Tidy Up Cinccino, as well as those that increase their physical bulk like Iron Defense Registeel and Bulk Up Scrafty, can pose a problem to Choice Scarf Basculegion, as either Basculegion's average Speed stat or the lack of an additional power boost can let it down against these threats. Thus, Pokemon that can check these foes such as Orthworm, Chandelure, and Sylveon are appreciated, providing some solid defensive backbone for Basculegion to fall back upon. In return, these Pokemon heavily appreciate Basculegion's strong offensive presence. A mixed attacking Assault Vest set can function as a decent bulky offensive pivot, leveraging Basculegion's solid special bulk against common special attackers like Munkidori. However, Basculegion's typing leaves it vulnerable to common special attackers such as Chandelure and Rotom-C, making its defensive use somewhat inconsistent. Additionally, the lack of reliable recovery makes it prone to being chipped down over time, forcing it to be paired with a Wish user and making it much less efficient into common threats. Choice Specs Basculegion is a decent option, with its stronger coverage options in Shadow Ball and Ice Beam, alongside Adaptability, compensating for its otherwise middling Special Attack stat. This set can threaten typical counterplay to physical Basculegion sets such as Vaporeon, Toxicroak, Dragalge, and Vileplume with either Shadow Ball or Ice Beam. Water-immune Pokemon: Vaporeon is an excellent answer to Basculegion thanks to Water Absorb making it immune to Basculegion's Water-type STAB moves alongside strong physical bulk with investment making it hardly deterred by any of Basculegion's coverage moves. Gastrodon functions similarly, albeit with more reliable recovery with Recover and the ability to turn Basculegion's Water-type moves into an opportunity for offensive momentum thanks to Storm Drain. Toxicroak can also switch into Basculegion's Water-type moves courtesy of Dry Skin and use Basculegion as fodder for setting up Swords Dance. However, Psychic Fangs obliterates Toxicroak, so it must be mindful of Basculegion's choice of coverage. Water- and Dragon-types: Milotic is generally a solid check to Basculegion thanks to Recover giving it extremely important longevity as well as Flip Turn letting Milotic use Basculegion as a chance to gain momentum. Inteleon can generally switch into Basculegion once and, in return, outspeed and OHKO Basculegion with Dark Pulse after some chip damage. Dragalge's solid physical bulk lets it come in on Basculegion's Water-type STAB moves and either wear it down with Sludge Bomb or finish it off with Draco Meteor. Paldean Tauros-W's high physical bulk combined with Intimidate and Bulk Up lets it easily come in on Basculegion's Water-type STAB moves, but it must exercise caution against sets with Psychic Fangs. Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena are able to handle Basculegion's Water-type moves outside of rain quite effectively and can overwhelm it with their STAB moves. Vileplume in particular can also take advantage of Basculegion's presence for longevity with either Giga Drain or Strength Sap. However, both of these Pokemon must be wary of Choice Band Ice Fang, as they are vulnerable to being 2HKOed by it. Vileplume also must look out for Psychic Fangs. Brute Bonnet is another excellent answer, resisting both of Basculegion's STAB attacks and OHKOing it in return with any of its STAB attacks. Additionally, Sucker Punch can easily pick off Basculegion. Faster Pokemon: Basculegion's bulk, while decent, leaves it vulnerable to various faster Pokemon with super effective coverage. Dark-types and Pokemon with Dark-type coverage such as Mienshao, Gallade, and Inteleon can all OHKO Basculegion with their respective Dark-type attacks after some minor chip damage. Other faster offensive Pokemon such as Tsareena, Kilowattrel, and Rotom-C can overwhelm Basculegion with super effective moves. However, all of these Pokemon have to be wary of Basculegion under rain, and non-Choice Scarf variants have to fear a possible Choice Scarf on Basculegion, as the majority of them are susceptible to being OHKOed by Basculegion's Wave Crash."

  "Basculegion-F": {
    "name": "Basculegion-F",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Basculegion-F is a strong option for speed control thanks to its powerful Adaptability-boosted attacks and good defensive typing. Its bulk and resistances offer it many opportunities to enter the field against common Pokemon like Slowbro, Jirachi, and Galarian Weezing. Choice Scarf enables Basculegion-F to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, including Jolly Barraskewda and Talonflame. Ice Beam is important to hit the Dragon- and Grass-types that resist Basculegion-F's STAB attacks like Cyclizar and Bulletproof Chesnaught. Flip Turn allows Basculegion-F to pivot out against special walls like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon while still dealing respectable damage thanks to Adaptability. It is not recommended to Terastallize Basculegion-F, as the damage boost is minimal, and Adaptability will no longer apply to its old typings. For this reason, it uses either Tera Ghost or Water, and it should be Terastallized primarily for the defensive benefits. Tera Ghost means that Basculegion is no longer weak to Electric- and Grass-type attacks from Hisuian Goodra, Armarouge, and Amoonguss, while Tera Water sheds the vulnerability to Sucker Punch from Bisharp and Shadow Sneak from Mimikyu. Choice Scarf Basculegion-F is most comfortable on bulky offense teams that appreciate its speed control while also making use of its defensive qualities to serve as a pivot. Since it is expected to enter the field multiple times, entry hazard removal options such as Cyclizar and Galarian Weezing are valuable allies, with Cyclizar being able to survive Electric- and Grass-type attacks from Choice-locked Hisuian Goodra and Amoonguss, while Galarian Weezing can tank physical attacks from faster Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos. Basculegion-F can form a VoltTurn core with teammates like Mienshao and Slither Wing that want to attack the special walls like Umbreon and Hisuian Goodra that answer Basculegion-F. Other bulkier Fighting-types like Chesnaught and Conkeldurr are also excellent teammates for Basculegion-F, as they can take Knock Off from Pokemon like Crawdaunt and Krookodile while threatening the Dark- and Normal-types that can switch into Shadow Ball such as Umbreon and Cyclizar. As Basculegion-F often needs help breaking through bulky Water- and Grass-types like Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Wo-Chien, other special attackers like Armarouge and Hisuian Goodra have the power and coverage to create holes in the opposing team for Basculegion-F to exploit. Hazards set by Pokemon such as Krookodile, Chesnaught, and Mew can weaken checks into KO range of Basculegion-F's attacks and rack up extended damage as it forces switches and pivots out. Sample set. Agility Basculegion-F is a potent special wallbreaker with an excellent and near-unresisted STAB combination for the tier. Ice Beam allows it to break through Dragon-types like Salamence and Noivern and Grass-types like Amoonguss and Chesnaught. Weakness Policy sets are particularly strong against a weak Knock Off from utility Pokemon like Cyclizar, Empoleon, and Chesnaught. On the other hand, Life Orb is a more reliable but less powerful option for powering up Basculegion-F's attacks. Its natural bulk along with this EV spread allows it to survive several key benchmark hits. 52 Defense EVs ensure Basculegion can comfortably survive a Sucker Punch from max Attack Bisharp from full health. Choice Scarf Gengar outspeeds Basculegion-F even after one Agility boost, but with 24 Special Defense EVs, Basculegion-F is guaranteed to take one Shadow Ball from Gengar from full health and fire back with its own Shadow Ball or use Agility a second time. 196 Speed EVs allow unboosted Basculegion-F to outspeed Bisharp. Adaptability makes Basculegion-F a subpar user of Terastallization, as the additional power boost from either Tera Ghost or Water is minimal and comes at the expense of losing its Adaptability boost on its other STAB type. However, Basculegion-F can utilize either Tera Ghost or Water in a pinch to squeeze out some extra damage or remove one of its weaknesses against foes such as Magnezone or Krookodile. Agility Basculegion fits well on offensive structures in search of a powerful special attacker and potential mid- to late-game sweeper. It appreciates rain support from Politoed to boost the power of its Water-type moves. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Terrakion, Krookodile, and Chesnaught enable Basculegion-F's ability to clean late-game as well. Chesnaught is an excellent partner for Basculegion-F on Spikes-stacking teams, as Chesnaught can tank the Dark- and Electric-type moves that threaten the fish while enjoying Basculegion-F's natural immunity to Rapid Spin from Cyclizar. Weakness Policy Basculegion-F sets can subsequently take advantage of Cyclizar by baiting a careless Knock Off and setting up with Agility or firing back with a boosted Ice Beam. Basculegion-F's ability to deny hazard removal from Cyclizar makes it an excellent addition to Sticky Web teams as well. Specially defensive Pokemon like Empoleon, Wo-Chien, and Hisuian Goodra are problematic for Basculegion-F, as they can comfortably stomach any of its unboosted attacks. Therefore, powerful Fighting-type wallbreakers like Terrakion, Galarian Zapdos, and Conkeldurr pair well with Basculegion-F in helping to eliminate these threatening foes. Basculegion-F in turn aids these Fighting-type wallbreakers by threatening their defensive answers like Hippowdon and Galarian Weezing. Basculegion-F is notably vulnerable to paralysis from status spreaders like Amoonguss and Jirachi, since the speed drop from paralysis neuters its ability to set up and sweep teams. Therefore, partners that can absorb or don't mind paralysis like Magnezone and Conkeldurr can be helpful teammates. If Basculegion-F is unable to use Agility, then Choice Scarf Gardevoir can take advantage of it due to Trace copying Adaptability. As a result, Steel-type stalwarts like Jirachi and Registeel are helpful in keeping Gardevoir at bay. Basculegion-F is also appreciative of teammates like Galarian Zapdos, Hippowdon, and Talonflame that can deal with strong priority users like Sucker Punch Bisharp and Shadow Sneak Mimikyu. Basculegion-F should be paired with allies like Hisuian Goodra, Bisharp, and Krookodile that can manage revenge killers that outspeed and KO a weakened Basculegion-F after one Agility such as Choice Scarf Gengar and Hisuian Zoroark."

  "Bastiodon": {
    "name": "Bastiodon",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Bastiodon is an excellent emergency button against the powerful setup threats in the metagame. The Iron Wall™ can use Heavy-Duty Boots alongside Sturdy to serve as a one time check to a surprisingly large amount of Pokemon. It can threaten foes with the combination of Iron Defense, Body Press, and a sizable Defense stat. That being said, its typing leaves much to be desired when it comes to taking multiple hits over the course of the game. Emergency Button: Oh no! The opponent has somehow managed to set up their Kingambit with five Supreme Overlord boosts to +6! It's still at full HP and has Terastallized into a Fairy-type! No fear, Bastiodon is here to survive with the combination of Heavy-Duty Boots and Sturdy and fire back a Counter to neutralize the threat, saving the day. Metal Burst can also be used when it is expected to cover for special attacking threats. Physical Wall: While Bastiodon's Steel Rock typing isn't amazing, it's still decent enough to check many physical attackers that may not afford or have access to Ground- or Fighting-type coverage. It can also punish U-turn and Knock Off with Rocky Helmet, phaze setup threats with Roar, and get up Stealth Rock. IronPress: One of Bastiodon's greatest tools is Body Press alongside its great Defense stat. It often opts for Iron Defense to boost its power and bulk simultaneously. Primary STAB Moves: Stone Edge, Rock Blast, Heavy Slam, Iron Head Setup Moves: Iron Defense, Curse Utility Moves: Stealth Rock, Counter, Metal Burst, Roar Coverage: Body Press, Foul Play, Earthquake, Fire Blast, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Avalanche Block: Block can be used to prey on passive Pokemon, forcing them to sit there and watch while Bastiodon boosts to the moon with Iron Defense and starts using Body Pressing against the opposing team. Heavy-Duty Boots: Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Sturdy intact. This is the main allure to using Bastiodon in the first place. Rocky Helmet: Rocky Helmet is useful when Bastiodon is planning on taking multiple physical hits over the course of the game, allowing it to spread some chip damage around. Custap Berry: Sturdy + Custap Berry is so intelligent and powerful, allowing for a priority move to be used after surviving a big hit at 1 HP. Leftovers: Leftovers is useful if Bastiodon values passive recovery over the course of multiple turns, especially on a set designed to set up and sweep with IronPress. Red Card: Red Card can be used against Booster Energy Pokemon, forcing them out. It can also be a way to delete a randomly forced in Pokemon via Counter or Metal Burst. Bastiodon is one of the better low cost Tera Captains, making it a great pair with another top tier Tera user. It can use Tera Fighting to power up its Body Press while simultaneously removing its crippling weaknesses to Ground, Fighting, and Water. As usual on bulky Pokemon, Tera Fairy, Water, and Steel are also options. Tera Ghost can help it come out on top in Body Press mirrors. Bastiodon is perhaps the most cost efficient everything-check in the tier, but you'd be an absolute fool to rely on it every game. If you draft it, you should have a good plan to deal with the powerful Fairy types that usually are checked by a draft's Steel Type, as Bastiodon is unable to switch into Pokemon like Enamorus and Iron Valiant. A Normal Team That Does Not Rely On Bastiodon: Bastiodon's a great Pokemon, but it does not fulfill any major roles to a team. If you are bringing Bastiodon to every game, you need to seek professional help to get rid of this addiction. A little fun on the weekends is cool, but don't make it a habit. Most Pokemon: Bastiodon is mostly just good for hitting that game saving Metal Burst, Foul Play, or Body Press, which is limited to one use per game. It cannot be combined with other coupons, but it is very good at doing that one thing."

    "name": "Bellibolt",
    "text": "Bellibolt is a fantastic physically defensive wall and utility pivot thanks to its decent defensive typing, great abilities in Static and Electromorphosis, reliable recovery in Slack Off, and access to useful utility moves like Volt Switch and Toxic. Toxic prevents Pokemon such as Gastrodon and Golurk from coming in freely to take advantage of Bellibolt while also putting setup sweepers such as Decidueye and Florges on a timer. Volt Switch allows Bellibolt to be an effective slow pivot and generate momentum for its team. Muddy Water can be used to directly threaten Ground-types such as Golurk, Mudsdale, and Gligar while also hitting the likes of Coalossal and Rotom-H. Parabolic Charge can be used in lieu of Volt Switch or Muddy Water, dealing damage while also functioning as a source of recovery that reduces Bellibolt's reliance on Slack Off. It should, however, only be used with the Electromorphosis ability, as it is fairly weak and unreliable without the Charge boost. Soak, while a more niche and hard-to-fit option, has benefits such as nullifying foes' STAB attacks and notably allowing Bellibolt to turn the tables on Ground-types; it can also work well in tandem with Parabolic Charge and removes the immunity to Toxic from the likes of Alolan Sandslash, Bronzong, and Galarian Slowbro, which can be invaluable in making progress against them. However, Soak is extremely niche and very hard to fit over Volt Switch or Muddy Water. Bellibolt generally prefers utilizing Static over Electromorphosis to hinder contact attackers like Arcanine, Paldean Tauros-W, and Scyther with paralysis. However, Electromorphosis can boost Bellibolt's Electric-type STAB attacks after taking a hit and works especially well when combined with Parabolic Charge. Heavy-Duty Boots is Bellibolt's preferred item, which can be useful to increase longevity against entry hazard-stacking teams. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet synergizes with Static to further punish contact attackers such as Staraptor, Paldean Tauros-W, and Ambipom. Another option is Leftovers to grant Bellibolt residual healing, reducing its reliance on Slack Off at the cost of its ability to prevent hazard chip or wear down contact attackers as effectively. Tera Water removes Bellibolt's weakness to Ground-types, allows it to better take on attackers like Arcanine and Bruxish, and also boosts the power of Muddy Water when targeting Ground-types. Bellibolt pairs well with frail offensive threats such as Bruxish, Flamigo, and Salazzle that appreciate its slow pivot support to get them onto the field safely. It can also form pivot cores with the aforementioned Bruxish and Flamigo as well as the likes of Scyther, which can handle Pokemon like Wo-Chien. Specially defensive walls such as Bronzong, Gastrodon, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro synergize well to handle the likes of Meloetta, Tatsugiri, and Toxtricity, respectively. Secondary physical walls such as Mudsdale, Milotic, and Galarian Slowbro can be useful to prevent Bellibolt from becoming overwhelmed by threats such as Skuntank, Paldean Tauros-W, and Flamigo. Mudsdale and Milotic can also help into setup sweepers like Scrafty and non-Taunt Grimmsnarl thanks to Roar and Haze, respectively. Powerful Ground-types such as Golurk can pressure Bellibolt, so switch-ins to these Ground-types such as Wo-Chien and Bombirdier are appreciated. Wo-Chien also helps into Nasty Plot Rotom-C and Swords Dance Decidueye. In return, Bellibolt is able to handle Pokemon like Scyther and Staraptor that it struggles with."

  "Bisharp": {
    "name": "Bisharp",
    "text": "Bisharp stands out as one of the premier setup sweepers in the metagame due its access to Swords Dance, strong priority in Sucker Punch, and impressive Eviolite-boosted bulk. Coupled with a fantastic defensive typing, Bisharp's bulk allows it to tank attacks from some of the most common Pokemon in the tier, including Cyclizar, Fezandipiti, and Jirachi, and use the turn to set up or strike back with its nigh-unresisted STAB combination. Sucker Punch elevates Bisharp into an incredibly threatening late-game cleaner after just one or two turns to set up, which Bisharp can easily gain through Terastallization. However, Bisharp suffers from a mediocre Speed stat that makes it slower than most other offensive threats and sweepers even with maximum Speed investment. The common Fighting-types in RU, including the likes of Slither Wing and Galarian Zapdos, are therefore able to comfortably outspeed and KO Bisharp while taking little damage from Sucker Punch. Physical walls such as Hippowdon and Chesnaught can similarly tank Bisharp's attacks and strike back with super effective attacks. Lastly, Bisharp often finds itself wanting in terms of special bulk even with Eviolite, and it can often be taken out by strong special wallbreakers after minimal chip damage. Swords Dance allows Bisharp to serve as a fantastic late-game sweeper. Sucker Punch provides strong priority that enables Bisharp to pick off weakened sweepers like Armarouge and Revavroom and improves its ability to clean. Eviolite drastically boosts Bisharp's ability to take hits, which can be invaluable for setting up. Defiant deters opposing Pokemon from using Defog and can potentially turn Bisharp into a deadly threat simply by getting Intimidated by Krookodile, Salamence, or Gyarados or switching into and receiving a stat drop from an attack like Gengar's Shadow Ball. 56 Speed EVs allow Bisharp to outspeed Adamant Conkeldurr. Tera Flying flips Bisharp's matchup against Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, allowing it to stay in on Pokemon such as Krookodile, Galarian Zapdos, and Slither Wing and use the turn to set up or grab a KO. Tera Dark is an option that instead boosts two of Bisharp's STAB attacks, which can be helpful for guaranteeing certain KOs such as unboosted Sucker Punch against Armarouge and +2 Throat Chop against Empoleon. Swords Dance Bisharp is able to reliably fill the role of a bulky revenge killer and late-game sweeper on both balance and offense structures. Entry hazard stacking teams, with setters such as Krookodile, Jirachi, and Chesnaught, are able to gradually bring the opposing team into range of Bisharp's attacks by wearing them down, thus easing its job as a cleaner. At the same time, Bisharp fills the role of deterring Defog from users like Galarian Weezing and Talonflame. Offense, particularly hyper offense, teams can similarly take advantage of Defiant, as hazards like Stealth Rock and Sticky Web set by Pokemon such as Kleavor and Ribombee are likely to stick around. Other setup sweepers like Armarouge, Throat Spray Yanmega, and Salamence work well with Bisharp, as they can weaken or take out defensive Pokemon such as Hisuian Goodra, Slowbro, and Hippowdon and improve Bisharp's odds of sweeping. Bisharp is simultaneously able to serve as a revenge killer due to its access to Sucker Punch, which can be instrumental in hyper offense mirror matchups for taking care of threats like Revavroom, Armarouge, and Gardevoir after they are weakened. A Ghost-type like Mimikyu or Weakness Policy Basculegion-F is also appreciated in these teams to block Rapid Spin from Cyclizar. Certain U-turn pivots, including the likes of Slither Wing, Mienshao, and Fezandipiti, pair well with Bisharp, as they can lure in and pivot out of Fairy- and Poison-type switch-ins, like Galarian Weezing and opposing Fezandipiti, that Bisharp can proceed to threaten offensively. Lastly, any of the fast Fighting-types in RU, such as Galarian Zapdos, Slither Wing, and Terrakion, can easily tank a Sucker Punch and threaten Bisharp with an OHKO. Therefore, teammates that resist Fighting like Galarian Weezing, Slowbro, and Amoonguss can be invaluable partners for Bisharp in bulkier structures to prevent these wallbreakers from making too much progress. Low Kick is a coverage option that can be used over Throat Chop to threaten opposing Bisharp, Registeel, and Crawdaunt more effectively. Tera Ghost gives Bisharp an immunity to Fighting, which can give it a free turn to set up against Fighting-type threats like Mienshao, Slither Wing, and Galarian Zapdos. The Ghost typing is particularly synergistic with Bisharp, as both of its weaknesses are naturally resisted by Bisharp, and it allows Bisharp to act as a spinblocker in a pinch for entry hazard stacking teams. However, Tera Ghost makes Bisharp weak to Knock Off, which can be very dangerous because it also neuters its bulk by removing Eviolite. Tera Grass combined with Tera Blast provides Bisharp with coverage for Quagsire and Hippowdon while also giving it a resistance to Earthquake. Tera Fairy is another option that provides valuable resistances to Fighting-, Dark-, and Bug-type attacks from the aforementioned Fighting-types. Fighting-types: A myriad of Fighting-type wallbreakers, from common presences like Galarian Zapdos and Slither Wing to niche picks like Lucario and Infernape, can comfortably tank even a +2 Sucker Punch and threaten Bisharp in turn with a KO. Chesnaught is a defensive Fighting-type that can reliably check Bisharp with its high physical bulk. However, all of these Pokemon should be wary of Terastallization, which can give Bisharp free turns to set up against them and potentially turn it into a game-ending threat. Physical Walls: Certain physical walls, including Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Body Press Registeel, are able to tank Bisharp's attacks and threaten it with super effective attacks. Unlike Chesnaught, they are usually unafraid of Terastallization due to their access to Whirlwind, Unaware, and Iron Defense, respectively, that can neutralize Bisharp's ability to set up. Special Wallbreakers: Strong, bulky special attackers such as Volcanion, Magnezone, and Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra are able to threaten Bisharp by targeting its middling special bulk. Magnet Pull Magnezone in particular can trap and eliminate Bisharp if it switches in safely. Burn: Due to Bisharp's low Speed, it is prone to getting outsped and crippled by fast Will-O-Wisp users including Talonflame and Gengar. Similarly, Galarian Weezing can often survive a hit and attempt to burn Bisharp with Will-O-Wisp despite being weak to Iron Head."

    "name": "Bombirdier",
    "text": "Bombirdier is one of PU's best offensive pivots and Knock Off spreaders thanks to its great offensive typing, spammable STAB moves, wide variety of utility options, and a great defensive profile allowing it to take advantage of Pokemon like Decidueye, Golurk, and Gastrodon. Sucker Punch allows Bombirdier to pick off weakened faster threats and setup sweepers such as Choice Scarf Staraptor, Delphox, and Toxtricity. Bombirdier has a wide variety of options in its final slot; Taunt allows Bombirdier to deny setup attempts from Pokemon like Arcanine and Scream Tail, hazard-setting attempts from Mudsdale and Gligar, Defog from Altaria, and recovery attempts from Pokemon like the beforementioned Altaria, Milotic, and Palossand. Stealth Rock allows Bombirdier to support its team with entry hazards and allows it to free up a moveslot for teammates like Alolan Sandslash and Gastrodon. Roost allows Bombirdier to capitalize on the switches it forces on Pokemon like Bronzong and Decidueye and recover off damage and Brave Bird recoil. U-turn or Parting Shot allows Bombirdier to safely pivot into teammates, but both moves can be hard to fit over other options. Tera Dark boosts the power of Knock Off and Sucker Punch, allowing Bombirdier to achieve rolls such as OHKOing Bronzong and Toxtricity with minimal chip and 2HKOing Altaria while also removing its weakness to Electric- and Rock-type attacks, which is valuable against Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Minior. Bombirdier finds itself on a wide variety of teams ranging from bulky balance to hyper offense. Although it resists Knock Off, Bombirdier appreciates fellow Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Scrafty and Paldean Tauros-F that can switch into Knock Off for it, as Bombirdier requires Heavy-Duty Boots to be an effective pivot. Bombirdier's ability to take out walls like Galarian Slowbro, Gastrodon, and Wo-Chien allows for Pokemon checked by these threats such as Calm Mind Florges, Tatsugiri, and Decidueye to become much more potent offensive threats. Bombirdier struggles with bulkier walls who can cripple it with status like Bellibolt and Coalossal, so Pokemon who can check these threats like Mudsdale, Goodra, and Tatsugiri make good partners. While it is immune to Ground-type attacks, Bombirdier should be paired with other Pokemon that resist Ground such as Decidueye and Bronzong because it cannot reliably take on Ground-types such as Gligar and Mudsdale on its own."

  "Brambleghast": {
    "name": "Brambleghast",
    "text": "Brambleghast is the premier Rapid Spin user in NU thanks to its high-Base Power STAB moves, typing that lets it beat common entry hazard setters like Swampert, Diancie, and Bronzong one-on-one, and solid Speed. Brambleghast's useful Wind Rider ability lets it block a possible Hurricane from Kilowattrel and Tornadus. Additionally, Brambleghast is a great wallbreaker, since not many Pokemon can take both of its STAB attacks. Choice Band makes Brambleghast into a dangerous threat, as defensive foes like Vileplume and Tsareena get 2HKOed by Poltergeist on the switch. However, Brambleghast's poor bulk makes it poor at checking wallbreakers like Mienshao, Flygon, and Paldean Tauros-W, as they can threaten it with a 2HKO from their coverage or Choice Band-boosted attacks, forcing Brambleghast to constantly use Strength Sap. Additionally, Brambleghast's typing leaves it weak to common Dark- and Fire-types like Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Chandelure. While Brambleghast does have good Speed, it's still outsped and revenge killed by foes like Inteleon and Munkidori or by priority attacks like Sucker Punch Toxicroak and Shadow Sneak Alolan Muk. Strength Sap lets Brambleghast check physical wallbreakers like Flygon, Paldean Tauros-W, and Breloom. However, Spikes can be used instead, letting Brambleghast become a solid entry hazard setter. Alternatively, Shadow Sneak lets it revenge kill weakened foes like Flygon, Munkidori, and Mienshao. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Brambleghast ignore entry hazards, meaning it can more reliably remove them, while Colbur Berry lets it tank Dark-type attacks such as Mienshao's Knock Off and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch, letting Brambleghast use Strength Sap on them or hit them back with its STAB attacks. Brambleghast can run a defensive set with an EV spread of 252 HP / 80 Def / 176 Spe and a Jolly nature on utility sets, as it lets Brambleghast better handle physical wallbreakers like Iron Thorns, Paldean Tauros-W, and Mienshao while letting it outspeed base 80 Speed Pokemon like Chandelure. Tera Fairy provides a Dark resistance while not throwing away its matchup into Fighting-types and Flygon. Alternatively, Tera Ghost gives both Poltergeist and Shadow Sneak a power boost, letting it 2HKO foes like Vileplume, Dragalge, and Copperajah with the former. Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Heracross are great partners for Brambleghast, as they can check Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Umbreon; in return, Brambleghast pressures Ghost- and bulky Psychic-types like Chandelure, Cresselia, and Galarian Slowbro. Incineroar is an exceptionally great partner for Brambleghast due to how it beats Grass-, Steel-, and Dark-types for Brambleghast, and in return, Brambleghast can check Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-types for Incineroar. Fire-types like Choice Scarf Chandelure and Talonflame outspeed Brambleghast and destroy it with their STAB attacks. Thus, it best pairs with bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tentacruel to check the aforementioned Fire-types. Faster Pokemon like Flygon, Mienshao, and Talonflame can easily revenge kill Brambleghast, so it synergizes well with defensive tanks like Sylveon, Galarian Slowbro, and Diancie that check them. Brambleghast appreciates special wallbreakers like Munkidori, Inteleon, and Kilowattrel for handling physical walls like Vileplume and Avalugg. Brambleghast can spinblock for hazard setters like Bronzong, Diance, and Swampert. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Staraptor that won't have Heavy-Duty Boots appreciate Brambleghast for its hazard removal. Choice Band allows Brambleghast to 2HKO Vileplume with Poltergeist and OHKO Vaporeon with Power Whip. Shadow Sneak lets Brambleghast pick off weakened foes like Flygon and Breloom. Tera Blast Ghost is a good alternative to Poltergeist, as it neither requires the foe to have an item nor can it miss. Tera Blast Ground could be used to hit common walls like Incineroar and Alolan Muk, but because Brambleghast needs to Terastallize for it to work and it almost always prefers a reliable Ghost-type STAB move, it isn't run. Ground-types like Flygon, Gligar, and Swampert appreciate Brambleghast for checking Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Paldean Tauros-W; in return, they can handle Fire-types like Talonflame and Chandelure. Brambleghast appreciates Fighting- and Fairy-types like Toxicroak, Heracross, and Diancie for checking Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Umbreon. Physical walls like Vileplume, Avalugg, and Tera Fairy Galarian Slowbro can tank many of Brambleghast's attacks very well, so it best synergize with special wallbreakers like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Chandelure to handle the physical walls. Brambleghast partners well with Pokemon like Cresselia, Munkidori, Meloetta, and Incineroar, as they can overwhelm shared checks like Alolan Muk and opposing Incineroar. Infiltrator lets Brambleghast target Substitute users like Flygon and Paldean Tauros-W and -F. Brambleghast can go itemless, reducing the power of Knock Off from Mienshao and Tsareena and walling opposing Brambleghast. Leech Seed can be run on defensive sets, letting Brambleghast make progress on foes like Incineroar, Registeel, and Sylveon. Night Shade lets Brambleghast do consistent damage against Dark-types like Bombirdier and Alolan Muk. A set with Spikes / Poltergeist / Rapid Spin / Curse and a Focus Sash turns Brambleghast into a solid lead hazard setter, as it can set up Spikes and punish foes like Incineroar and Alolan Muk with Curse damage. Tera Water gives it a useful resistance against Fire-type attacks, but it makes Brambleghast weak to other Grass-types like Tsareena and Rotom-C. Dark-types: Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Bombirdier resist both of Brambleghast's STAB attacks and can destroy it with their own STAB attacks. Umbreon can threaten Brambleghast with either Foul Play or Toxic, but it is wary of switching into Choice Band-boosted Power Whip. Fire-types: Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion destroy Brambleghast with their STAB attacks. Hisuian Typhlosion can outspeed Brambleghast, while Chandelure requires a Choice Scarf to outspeed it, but they are wary of switching into its Poltergeist and can be picked off by Shadow Sneak. Talonflame outspeeds Brambleghast, and it can threaten it back with either a KO from its Brave Bird or cripple Brambleghast with burn from Will-O-Wisp or Flame Body. However, Talonflame doesn't enjoy directly switching into Poltergeist. Physical Walls: Vileplume and Avalugg can tank Brambleghast's attacks and both of them having recovery makes it a lot more difficult for Brambleghast to break through them. However, Vileplume can't directly switch into Choice Band Brambleghast, as it gets 2HKOed. Other physical walls like Dragalge, Talonflame, and bulky Tsareena can tank Choice Banded Brambleghast's attacks and threaten it back with their own attacks, but they have to predict correctly or they take significant damage. Revenge Killers: Faster foes like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Air Slash Kilowattrel can threaten Brambleghast with their attacks due to its poor bulk or use it for momentum, but they don't enjoy switching into Brambleghast's STAB attacks. Priority users like First Impression Flygon and Sucker Punch Toxicroak can easily revenge kill Brambleghast after it's been weakened."

    "name": "Bruxish",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Bruxish is a great choice for a mid-game wallbreaker or late-game cleaner because of its dynamic STAB combination, access to priority, excellent Speed tier, and exceptional coverage that is largely boosted by Strong Jaw. Choice Scarf Bruxish notably outpaces other Choice Scarf users in the tier like Rotom-C, Flamigo, and Meloetta. Flip Turn is a great momentum move, as Bruxish uses its fast pivoting abilities to allow slower teammates like Golurk to enter the field safely and wear down its checks like Bronzong, Galarian Slowbro, and Wo-Chien. Crunch hits Ghost- and Psychic-types like Bronzong, Decidueye, Galarian Slowbro, and Galarian Articuno for massive damage. Aqua Jet is a strong STAB priority option that allows Choice Scarf Bruxish to reliably revenge kill other Choice Scarf users like Staraptor and Paldean Tauros-F. Ice Fang is a strong coverage option to chunk Dragon- and Grass-types like Altaria, Goodra, and Rotom-C. Strong Jaw is an outstanding ability for Bruxish, as a lot of its attacks like Psychic Fangs, Ice Fang, and Crunch are benefitted by the large boost it provides. Dazzling is a secondary choice for ability on Bruxish and prevents priority against it, stopping Sucker Punch and Shadow Sneak from the likes of Skuntank and Decidueye, respectively, along with Extreme Speed from Curse Arcanine and Quick Attack from Scyther. While Dazzling is a solid ability and prevents Bruxish from being taken out with priority, it does miss potential rolls that Strong Jaw provides such as a 2HKO on Bronzong with Crunch, a 2HKO on Gastrodon with Psychic Fangs, and an OHKO on Altaria with Ice Fang. Tera Psychic boosts Psychic Fangs to nearly unwallable levels when combined with Strong Jaw, providing 2HKOs into Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Milotic after minimal chip. Tera Water can be run to bolster Wave Crash, Flip Turn, and Aqua Jet damage, notably giving Wave Crash the boost needed to 2HKO Goodra and OHKO Paldean Tauros-F after an Intimidate drop while also removing the weaknesses to Dark and Ghost, which is especially important on Strong Jaw sets. Choice Scarf Bruxish can fit on all sorts of teams, being found mainly on balance and offense as a form of Speed control and breaking power. With access to Flip Turn, VoltTurn cores with teammates like Kilowattrel, Rotom-H, and Scyther can be incredibly difficult for teams to manage throughout a game. Entry hazard stacking teams similarly use the threat of Flip Turn and strong breaking power to rack up hazard chip, appreciating support from Knock Off users like Bombirdier, Gligar, and Skuntank to remove Heavy-Duty Boots. Bombirdier is a notable teammate for Bruxish because of its access to Stealth Rock and U-turn, and it is usually easy to slot one of these on Bombirdier. Bombirdier also resists Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, so the duo has immense upside as a capable VoltTurn duo that has a lot of utility and coverage. Other teammates like Flamigo and Staraptor can help break through bulky checks to Bruxish, such as Duraludon and Wo-Chien, and can provide another mid-game breaker or late-game cleaner for teams that strive to keep offensive pressure up. To break through physical walls more efficiently, teams using Choice Scarf Bruxish can often slot a strong special attacker like Hoopa, Zoroark, or Toxtricity to support its endeavors to break teams down, with the latter two having access to pivot moves to further build off the VoltTurn structure. Bruxish's ability to threaten every Ground-type in the tier is also important for teammates like Arcanine and Salazzle, which become very threatening late-game when Ground-types are removed. Bruxish serves as one of PU's most frightening wallbreakers thanks to its high Attack and alright Speed stat, its access to Strong Jaw, great move options with a great STAB combination, priority, pivoting moves, and coverage options. It 2HKOes a vast majority of the tier's staple walls, like Bellibolt, Mudsdale, Galarian Slowbro, and Gastrodon, with its terrifying STAB attacks. Aqua Jet is used to deal with faster weakened threats and setup sweepers, such as Choice Scarf Flamigo and Salazzle. Finally, Flip Turn lets Bruxish safely switch out of bad matchups, such as Wo-Chien and Bronzong. Tera Psychic can be used to let Psychic Fangs OHKO Pokemon like bulky Florges, and it removes Bruxish's weaknesses to the Grass- and Electric-types that litter the tier. Tera Water can be used to OHKO foes like Bronzong and Alolan Sandslash after Stealth Rock chip damage. It also removes Bruxish's Ghost and Dark weaknesses, making Pokemon like Decidueye easier to deal with. Due to Bruxish's pitiful defenses and rather mediocre Speed stat, it fits best on bulky balance and offense teams to make up for its lackluster hit-taking abilities. Bruxish struggles with faster or bulkier Dark-type Pokemon such as Zoroark and Wo-Chien, so it really appreciates Fighting-type Pokemon like Flamigo and Scrafty, which also provide a valuable Knock Off-resistant teammate. Defensive Ground-types like Gligar work well with Bruxish, as they remove deadly threats like Bellibolt and Choice Scarf Toxtricity, while Bruxish can deal with Pokemon that check them like Hoopa and opposing Gligar. Gastrodon is another valuable defensive Knock Off absorber if it runs Sticky Hold and can set Stealth Rock and deals well with Bruxish's counters, such as Eviolite Duraludon. Faster Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon, such as Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Rotom-C, threaten Bruxish immensely, so teammates that resist their moves such as Rotom-H and Venusaur are great teammates, along with being more reliable checks to Paldean Tauros-W than Bruxish. In return, Bruxish can take out the Poison- and Rock-type Pokemon that threaten them such as Salazzle, Galarian Slowbro, and Coalossal. Teammates such as Choice Scarf Toxtricity and Arcanine appreciate Bruxish, as it can remove the bulky Pokemon that wall them such as Coalossal, Gligar, and Mudsdale. Thanks to Bruxish's wallbreaking ability, it makes for a great teammate for late-game sweepers and cleaners, such as Staraptor, Salazzle, and Ambipom. Sample set. Stay tuned for updates!"

However, it is hindered by its poor defensive typing and Speed outside of Trick Room, which makes it heavily dependent on Terastallization in some matchups, and the high usage of its checks like Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, Kyogre, and defensive Arceus formes means most teams will be well-prepared against it. Nevertheless, while in Trick Room, Calyrex-I is a nearly unmatched offensive force that can quickly overwhelm teams if it's left unchecked for even a single turn. Heavy-Duty Boots is typically the best item for Calyrex-I, since it helps Calyrex-I leverage its good natural bulk and more easily find setup opportunities by negating its crippling weakness to entry hazards. However, on teams that can keep hazards off the field, Calyrex-I can occasionally make use of other items. An Occa Berry allows Calyrex-I to avoid being OHKOed by Koraidon's Flare Blitz or comfortably tank a rare Fire-type move from Miraidon or Eternatus, affording Calyrex-I additional setup opportunities or a surprise KO without the need to Terastallize. Weakness Policy makes use of Calyrex-I's ability to withstand most super effective attacks, especially on teams with screens support, and provides it with sufficient boosts to tear through opposing teams. For example, Calyrex-I has favorable odds to OHKO even the bulkiest Necrozma-DM with High Horsepower after a Swords Dance and Weakness Policy boost. Tera Fire is an invaluable defensive option for Calyrex-I to flip its weaknesses to Steel- and Fire-type moves into resistances—crucially helping it against Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Koraidon—while also avoiding being burned by moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire. Tera Ground can be used instead to boost the power of High Horsepower, notably OHKOing Zacian-C without need for a boost and Necrozma-DM and most Kyogre after a Swords Dance, and remove all of Calyrex-I's weaknesses, but it leaves Calyrex-I still vulnerable to being burned. A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs is preferred to move first in Trick Room against nearly all foes and, at worst, Speed tie with Kingambit and opposing Calyrex-I, but an Adamant nature with at least 22 Speed IVs can be used to be faster than Ting-Lu outside of Trick Room if Kingambit and opposing Calyrex-I are not a concern. Calyrex-I is a cornerstone of many offense teams in Ubers thanks to its ability to punch holes in defensive cores and alleviate the danger of fast hyper offense teams, especially those with Sticky Web support, courtesy of Trick Room. Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM make good teammates, as they share many of the same checks with Calyrex-I, for example Arceus-Water and opposing Necrozma-DM; together, they can pressure their shared checks enough for each other to sweep. Necrozma-DM is also a competent user of Trick Room, and it can potentially take Calyrex-I's place—or vice versa—should it fall while Trick Room is in effect. Other physical sweepers like Koraidon, Arceus-Ground, and Extreme Killer Arceus appreciate Calyrex-I's ability to overwhelm common defensive walls, such as Arceus-Fairy and Ho-Oh, with boosted Glacial Lances. Miraidon is a good partner for Calyrex-I, since it threatens to OHKO the Water-types that Calyrex-I dislikes facing, and it can use U-turn to bring Calyrex-I in on Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, and Clodsire that it can use as setup fodder. Screens support from Grimmsnarl makes Calyrex-I practically impossible to OHKO and difficult to even 2HKO, enabling it to boost an extra time with Swords Dance or take on a foe it might not usually be able to beat. Calyrex-I benefits greatly from the support of Spikes setters, such as Deoxys-S, Glimmora, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu, to help break through its most potent counter, Arceus-Water, and punish the frequent switches Calyrex-I forces. Close Combat is an option over High Horsepower to OHKO Air Balloon Kingambit and deal more significant damage to Kyogre and Arceus-Water, but it is noticeably weaker against Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C, and the Defense drops make Calyrex-I much easier to KO. A Choice Band set that utilizes Tera Ice can overpower even the bulkiest Ice-resistant Pokemon after only a single Chilling Neigh boost. However, Calyrex-I's weakness to entry hazards and status as well as its inability to set Trick Room for itself while holding a Choice Band necessitates dedicated Trick Room and Healing Wish support from multiple teammates, which is often impractical. Mental Herb can be used to block Taunt from the likes of Miraidon and the Arceus formes when attempting to set up, but Calyrex-I is too infrequently targeted with Taunt to justify its use over other items, which Calyrex-I will almost always get value from. Arceus-Water: The combination of Arceus-Water's typing, fantastic Defense, and access to moves like Will-O-Wisp and Dragon Tail leaves Calyrex-I with scarce hope of ever breaking past it, even with Terastallization. Necrozma-DM: With its Steel typing and Prism Armor ability, Necrozma-DM can comfortably tank attacks from Calyrex-I, even after a Swords Dance boost, and threaten heavy damage in return. Necrozma-DM can also use an unboosted Calyrex-I as fodder to set up its own Swords Dance or Dragon Dance boosts. However, with Terastallization, Calyrex-I can set up on Necrozma-DM and potentially beat it, especially if Necrozma-DM is lacking a setup move. Kyogre: Kyogre has sufficient bulk to avoid being 2HKOed by High Horsepower with only minimal defensive investment, and it can comfortably 2HKO Calyrex-I in the rain. Kyogre's presence also deters Calyrex-I from Terastallizing into a Fire-type to break past its teammates. However, Kyogre's lack of reliable recovery prevents it from repeatedly switching in against Calyrex-I and allows it to be worn down by Calyrex-I's teammates. Ice-resistant Pokemon: When they're healthy, Ice-resistant Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao can avoid being OHKOed by Calyrex-I and deal significant damage in return, usually defeating Calyrex-I outside of Trick Room. However, they are susceptible to falling to Calyrex-I when Trick Room is in effect or if Calyrex-I has enough boosts. Additionally, many Pokemon run Ice-resistant Tera types, such as Tera Steel on Giratina-O and Arceus-Ground and Tera Water on Arceus-Fairy and Gliscor. Air Balloon Kingambit: An Air Balloon replaces Kingambit's Ground weakness with an immunity, which denies Calyrex-I the opportunity to OHKO Kingambit with High Horsepower after a Swords Dance. This allows it to beat Calyrex-I even in Trick Room unlike other Kingambit sets that can be removed by a boosted High Horsepower. Unaware Walls: Unaware walls impede Calyrex-I's offensive output considerably, though they are typically found only on stall teams. Skeledirge can threaten to burn it with Will-O-Wisp and heal any damage taken with Slack Off—however, it does take considerable damage from High Horsepower—while Dondozo's typing and gargantuan physical bulk allow it to slowly wear down Calyrex-I without fear of being KOed."

    "name": "Calyrex-Shadow",
    "text": "Calyrex-S is the most prominent, centralizing threat in Anything Goes by virtue of its nigh-unmatched Speed tier and variety of offensive options. Astral Barrage shreds through neutral targets, and Calyrex-S is able to overcome its defensive checks by using its broad selection of coverage, Tera types, utility, and item options. Additionally, thanks in part to its ability As One, Calyrex-S can snowball late-game when its checks are worn down. However, Calyrex-S's bulk is rather unimpressive, limiting its ability to switch in aggressively or set up on defensive Pokemon. Calyrex-S also struggles early-game against Pokemon resistant to Ghost, such as Arceus, Arceus-Dark, and Ting-Lu, as they are able to halt its momentum by switching in to Astral Barrage. Additionally, Ho-Oh's high Special Defense and access to Regenerator allow it to pivot into Choice item variants of Calyrex-S. Choice Scarf Calyrex-S is a phenomenal speed control option on balance and bulky offense teams. Its Speed stat eclipses that of other Choice Scarf users, such as Koraidon and Miraidon; moreover, it is able to reliably revenge kill 1+ Scale Shot Koraidon, setting it apart from its aforementioned competitors. As One allows Calyrex-S to snowball in endgame scenarios. Grass Knot weakens Ting-Lu, which can otherwise switch in and use Spikes. Psychic lets Calyrex-S OHKO Koraidon while also dealing significant chip damage to bulky Arceus. Lastly, Trick cripples Calyrex-S's main defensive checks in Ting-Lu, Arceus, and Ho-Oh, which its teammates can take advantage of. Tera Ghost furthers the strength of Astral Barrage, which secures KOs on weakened targets such as Miraidon and Zacian-C and allows Calyrex-S to 2HKO Ho-Oh. Alternatively, Calyrex-S can opt for Tera Grass in order to 2HKO Ting-Lu with Grass Knot and OHKO both Kyogre and Arceus-Ground after minimal chip damage. Most forms of balance and bulky offense should consider adding Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, as it provides teams with a reliable option to revenge kill Scale Shot Koraidon. Calyrex-S being a team's Choice Scarf user can give Koraidon the freedom to use a different item. Calyrex-S synergizes well with Pokemon that can take advantage of Astral Barrage switch-ins like Arceus, Arceus-Dark, and Ting-Lu. Powerful wallbreakers such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Kyogre are capable of this. Partners that can wear down Ting-Lu throughout the game, such as Eternatus and Miraidon, can help ease the burden on Calyrex-S. Because Ho-Oh can pivot into Calyrex-S's moves, wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Koraidon, offensive Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM that can wear Ho-Oh down serve as excellent teammates. Calyrex-S appreciates support from entry hazard setters, namely Ting-Lu and Eternatus, in order to secure KOs late-game. Arceus-Water is a reliable defensive switch-in to Arceus and Ho-Oh, and it can stop any offensive momentum they gain at Calyrex-S's expense. Choice Specs Calyrex-S is an excellent wallbreaker, independently breaking through most of its usual checks with accurate prediction. Grass Knot most importantly 2HKOes Ting-Lu, as well as pressuring neutral targets like Arceus and OHKOing Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground after entry hazard damage. Psychic 2HKOes Arceus, while Psyshock 2HKOes offensive Ho-Oh, has a better chance of OHKOing Eternatus, and hits Pokemon such as Blissey. Trick + Choice Specs debilitates Calyrex-S's checks like Ho-Oh, Ting-Lu, and Arceus by removing the longevity their items grant them and forcing them to attack. Tera Ghost allows Astral Barrage to 2HKO Ting-Lu with less chip damage, OHKO Ho-Oh with an As One boost, and OHKO Necrozma-DM with a neutral Tera type, in addition to 2HKOing Ho-Oh and defensive Arceus formes after Calyrex-S loses its Choice Specs because of Trick. Tera Grass gives Grass Knot a good chance of OHKOing Ting-Lu after hazard damage and lets it 2HKO Arceus; Tera Grass also grants Calyrex-S a resistance to Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground's Earthquake. Tera Normal prevents revenge killing attempts from opposing Calyrex-S. All three Tera types also allow Calyrex-S to survive attacks like Ting-Lu's Payback and Arceus's Shadow Claw, though the latter two make it vulnerable to Arceus's Extreme Speed. Calyrex-S is best used on balance and bulky offense teams, where it can pressure various defensive Pokemon and rely on its teammates to deal with revenge killers. Koraidon can threaten Ting-Lu and Arceus for Calyrex-S and use U-turn to safely bring it in against Pokemon it threatens like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground; additionally, the pair can wear down Ho-Oh for each other. Similarly, Zacian-C and Calyrex-S can deal with each other's checks and overwhelm Ho-Oh together. Kyogre threatens Ting-Lu and Ho-Oh for Calyrex-S, which can pressure Eternatus for it. Necrozma-DM appreciates Calyrex-S weakening Ting-Lu and Ho-Oh and threatening its checks like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground; in return, it can somewhat deal with Arceus and potentially lure in and KO Ho-Oh with Stone Edge. Ho-Oh can switch into Arceus, Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, and Ting-Lu, and Calyrex-S can deal with two of Ho-Oh's primary checks in Eternatus and Arceus-Water. Ting-Lu can also check Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, as well as wearing foes down into Calyrex-S's KO range via Spikes, which it potentially trades with opposing Ting-Lu. Miraidon and Calyrex-S can weaken Ting-Lu for each other, and Miraidon can switch into and threaten Ho-Oh. Defensive Arceus formes—namely Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Fairy—can check Choice Scarf Koraidon and Arceus, and the former can also deal with Ho-Oh. Nasty Plot Calyrex-S is a superb wallbreaker and sweeper that provides a ton of incredible utility by virtue of its nigh unmatched Speed tier and immense power, keeping an armada of different threats, most notably Necrozma-DM and Koraidon, in check. Grass Knot is crucial coverage that hits Ting-Lu hard, which would otherwise comfortably wall Calyrex-S, and deals extra damage to Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and Kyogre. Psychic OHKOes Koraidon, 2HKOes Eternatus, and is Calyrex-S's strongest option against Arceus. Alternatively, Encore enables Calyrex-S to aggressively switch in on any attempts to heal or set up from nearly any relevant Pokemon in the metagame, generating free turns to use Nasty Plot or fire off powerful attacks. Calyrex-S can also run Psyshock as its strongest move against Eternatus—OHKOing after a boost from As One—and hits Calm Mind users like Kyogre or Arceus-Ground; it's also Calyrex-S's best move for niche walls like Blissey and Clodsire. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Calyrex-S to repeatedly switch in with impunity and bludgeon its checks until it can break through them. Life Orb is an alternative on hyper offense teams that gives Calyrex-S ludicrous power, letting it OHKO supposed answers like Ho-Oh and Ting-Lu after a Nasty Plot. Tera Stellar boosts Calyrex-S's power just enough to hit multiple important thresholds once boosted, OHKOing Ho-Oh and offensive Arceus, as well as Ting-Lu after two layers of Spikes. Sets lacking a Psychic-type attack can run Tera Ghost to 2HKO Eternatus and Ho-Oh while the lessened Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses enables Calyrex-S to survive Arceus's Shadow Claw and Ting-Lu's Payback. Tera Normal is an option on Life Orb variants to turn the tables on Giratina-O and opposing Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, as these sets do not need the additional firepower provided by an offensive Tera, albeit at the cost of becoming vulnerable to Arceus's Extreme Speed. Tera Grass allows Calyrex-S to survive a boosted Earthquake from Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground and always OHKO Ting-Lu and offensive Arceus at +2. Nasty Plot Calyrex-S is a potent addition to nearly every kind of team. Balance and bulky offense teams love it for its potency as a wallbreaker that provides immense utility as a revenge killer and by potentially using Encore, whereas it is borderline mandatory on hyper offense due to its unmatched explosivity and Speed. Koraidon is Calyrex-S's best partner on every kind of team, terrifying Arceus and Ting-Lu while amplifying the pressure placed upon Ho-Oh; on bulkier teams, it takes the mantle of being the team's Choice Scarf user that Calyrex-S must forfeit by opting for Nasty Plot, whereas on hyper offense, it backs up Calyrex-S as one of the core setup sweepers and wallbreakers. Ting-Lu is a great partner for its overall immense defensive utility and capability to answer Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, and its Spikes can wear down opposing Ting-Lu and defensive Arceus formes into range for Calyrex-S to KO them. Ho-Oh provides refuge from Choice Scarf Calyrex-S and Koraidon, the most common revenge killers of Calyrex-S, as well as checking Arceus and Ting-Lu. Ho-Oh is a major nuisance for Calyrex-S, so switch-ins to it like Eternatus or Arceus-Water are important to have. On hyper offense, suicide leads like Deoxys-S, Ribombee, and Glimmora can set entry hazards to weaken foes for Calyrex-S and its teammates or—in Ribombee's case—hinder revenge killers."

    "name": "Caribolt",
    "text": "This analysis was uploaded prior to The Indigo Disk release and may contain outdated information. Caribolt is a nuclear wallbreaker for offensive teams. Double-Edge with Galvanize can break through even the tier's most stalwart walls, 2HKOing Pokemon like Skeledirge and Garganacl with ease, especially once Caribolt Terastallizes. Horn Leech provides some modicum of recovery to compensate for Double-Edge's recoil. Rapid Spin both increases Caribolt's Speed, giving it sweeping potential, and supports teammates weak to Stealth Rock like Baxcalibur and Iron Moth, allowing them to forego Heavy-Duty Boots. Leftovers helps make up for Double-Edge's recoil alongside Horn Leech, while Magnet powers up Caribolt's Electric-type attacks even further. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Choice Scarf Jumbao at +1 Speed and Krilowatt at +0, but Adamant is an option to deal as much damage as possible, supporting its hyper offense teammates. Tera Grass is an option to turn Ground-types like Equilibra and Great Tusk into setup fodder, but Caribolt's main focus should be on wallbreaking as much as possible for its teammates. Caribolt is best utilized on hyper offense teams, which appreciate its incredible wallbreaking ability. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth, Baxcalibur, and Venomicon-E appreciate Caribolt removing the hazard, allowing Iron Moth and Baxcalibur to run more offensive items over Heavy-Duty Boots. Other physical sweepers like Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and Dragonite love Caribolt powering through Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Arghonaut; Roaring Moon pairs particularly well with Caribolt, as it can threaten the Grass-types like Jumbao and Amoonguss that give Caribolt trouble with Tera Flying + Acrobatics. This love is shared by special sweepers like Iron Valiant and Hatterene, which need Skeledirge off the table before attempting a sweep. Caribolt appreciates entry hazards weakening physically bulky Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu—which can beat Caribolt if it Terastallizes—into KO range of its attacks, so pairing it with a dedicated lead like Greninja or Meowscarada is suggested. Grass-types: Grass-types like Jumbao, Pyroak, and Amoonguss wall Caribolt's STAB combination, forcing it out. Faster Attackers: Before Caribolt uses Rapid Spin, Pokemon like Cinderace and Ice Beam Greninja can outspeed and OHKO it. Fast Dragon-types like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Astrolotl can switch in to check Caribolt once, but they cannot do so if Caribolt reaches both +1 Speed and +2 Attack. Strong Priority Attacks: Strong priority attacks from Kingambit, Dragonite, and Revenankh can circumvent Caribolt's Speed boosts and KO it after it has taken some chip damage from Double-Edge."

  "Chandelure": {
    "name": "Chandelure",
    "text": "With Chandelure's tremendous Special Attack and STAB attacks, it can hit the entire tier for at least neutral damage, barring Incineroar. Chandelure, donning a Choice Specs, easily breaks through would-be checks like Diancie and Alolan Muk. However, with Choice Scarf, it becomes a dangerous revenge killer that’s able to check setup sweepers like Munkidori and Mienshao. Chandelure also learns Trick, which allows it to cripple walls and bulky setup sweepers alike such as Umbreon, Incineroar, and Cresselia. However, Chandelure has to deal with being extremely weak to entry hazards, limiting its opportunities to switch in. On top of that, Chandelure itself is quite easily revenge killed due to faster Choice Scarf users that are able to threaten it with their own STAB moves or through coverage moves like Flygon, Mienshao, and Meloetta. Fire Blast is preferred to 2HKO Alolan Muk as to not let it switch in safely, but Flamethrower can be used to be more accurate. Energy Ball hits Fire-type checks such as Swampert and Diancie. Trick cripples walls like Umbreon and Incineroar, but Overheat allows Chandelure to overwhelm Incineroar and Assault Vest users like Alolan Muk and Meloetta over the course of a battle. Tera Grass allows Chandelure to take a Ground- or Water-type attack in a pinch while boosting its Energy Ball, but Tera Fire can be used to give it insane breaking power. Chandelure has issues with switching in, so Pokemon that can pivot like Mienshao, Flygon, and Dragalge pair well, drawing in defensive Psychic-, Grass-, and Steel-types such as Galarian Slowbro, Vileplume, and Copperajah for Chandelure to prey on. With Trick crippling specially defensive foes like Alolan Muk and Umbreon, a partner that can take advantage of this like Munkidori or Cresselia helps with overwhelming these shared checks. Pairing Chandelure with Fighting-types like Mienshao, Gallade, and Scrafty helps it take on Dark-types like Incineroar and Alolan Muk, which it tends to struggle against. With how vulnerable Chandelure is to entry hazards, it pairs greatly with hazards removal from Talonflame, Tsareena, and Tentacruel. Vileplume, Wo-Chien, and Tsareena are great teammates for Chandelure, as they check the Ground- and Water-types that scare it out like Flygon, Basculegion, and Inteleon; on top of that, the former two teammates can spread paralysis with Stun Spore. Fire Blast gives Chandelure a powerful STAB Fire-type attack, but Flamethrower can be run for a more accurate move. Energy Ball hits Fire-resistant Pokemon like Diancie, Vaporeon, and Swampert. Trick cripples walls and bulky setup sweepers like Alolan Muk and Scrafty. When backed into a corner, Tera Grass lets Chandelure take a Water- or Ground-type attack and boosts its Energy Ball, but Tera Fire can help it clean more easily. With how Chandelure fails to do much of anything versus Dark-types like Incineroar and Alolan Muk, partners that can overwhelm, chip away at, or cripple these Pokemon are vital. So, pair Chandelure with teammates like Munkidori, Klefki, and Meloetta. Chandelure's middling Speed means more common opposing Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Flygon, and Hisuian Typhlosion will easily outspeed and OHKO it. Placing Chandelure on a hyper offense team with Sticky Web support from Galvantula and setup sweepers like Breloom, Drednaw, and Gallade helps it circumvent its disappointing Speed tier and provides it tons of wallbreakers to help it clean weakened teams in the end-game. Chandelure's weakness to being worn down by entry hazards stops it from revenge killing as often as it would want to, so teammates like Tsareena, Talonflame, and Tentacruel are crucial. Fire Blast is preferred to 2HKO Alolan Muk after a Calm Mind boost and deal greater damage to other special walls like Umbreon and Florges, but Flamethrower can be used for its accuracy. Energy Ball targets common Water-, Rock-, and Ground-type switch-ins like Vaporeon, Diancie, and Gastrodon. Flash Fire gives Chandelure the ability to take advantage of Choice-locked Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion, Infernape, and opposing Chandelure. On the other hand, Flame Body lets Chandelure punish contact moves like Flygon's U-turn and Tsareena's Power Whip, but these targets and most others usually carry another move to hit Chandelure super effectively, negating its utility. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Chandelure to ignore entry hazards, letting it switch in repeatedly without worry. However, Air Balloon can be used instead to give Chandelure a temporary immunity to Ground-type attacks, giving Chandelure opportunities to set up against Earthquake Paldean Tauros-F and Choice-locked Flygon. Tera Grass boosts Energy Ball while giving Chandelure a resistance to Ground- and Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Flygon, Swampert, and Vaporeon. Tera Fairy can be used on Air Balloon sets to completely wall Flygon's STAB moves, and in general, it helps with taking Dark-type attacks from the likes of Bombirdier and Incineroar. Ground-types like Flygon and Gligar can destroy Chandelure with their STAB Earthquake, and they can also force it to Terastallize. Therefore, it best partners with defensive Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Swampert, as they can check the aforementioned Ground-types; in return, Chandelure handles Grass-types like Tsareena, Breloom, and Vileplume. Fairy- and Fighting-types like Sylveon, Toxicroak, and Paldean Tauros-W are great teammates for Chandelure, as they can handle the Dark-types like Umbreon, Incineroar, and Alolan Muk. Chandelure appreciates slow pivots like Swampert, Dragalge, and Bellibolt giving it a safe entry without the risk of taking damage. Galvantula and Araquanid are great partners for Chandelure, as they can set up Sticky Web to remedy Chandelure's underwhelming Speed, letting it outspeed and KO faster foes like Mienshao, Inteleon, and Paldean Tauros-W. On these teams, fellow setup sweepers like Swords Dance Toxicroak, Nasty Plot Munkidori, and Shell Smash Torterra can take advantage of Water-types, overwhelm Dark-types, and help beat Ground-types for Chandelure, respectively. Air Balloon Chandelure is vulnerable to Stealth Rock; thus, it pairs well with hazard removers like Brambleghast, Cinccino, and Tsareena. With a moveset of Will-O Wisp / Pain Split / Energy Ball / Hex, an EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe, and a Bold nature, Chandelure, with Heavy-Duty Boots, can become an effective physical wall, spreading burns on the opposing team quite easily; however, most things it would want to check typically carry super effective coverage in Knock Off. Heavy-Duty Boots Chandelure can also run Flame Charge or Trailblaze to pick off weakened threats and sweep with its boosted Speed. Chandelure can run Hex on a status spreading team; however, it must give up a powerful STAB attack, coverage, or Trick to do so. Choice Scarf Chandelure can run Memento on a hyper offense team to try to aid its teammates in setting up once it becomes useless. Chandelure can also run Heavy-Duty Boots or Air Balloon to circumvent its entry hazards weakness and Ground-type weakness, respectively. If it runs these, though, it becomes noticeably weaker and slower. Dark-types: Dark-types are a pain for Chandelure mostly because they tend to be able to take one attack and retaliate with a Knock Off. Specifically, Incineroar is quite problematic, since it resists all of Chandelure's attacks and is quite specially defensive, but due its to lack of recovery and entry hazards weakness, Incineroar can be chipped over the course of a game and taken advantage of with Trick, giving Chandelure its Heavy-Duty Boots. Ghost-types: While Chandelure is able to beat Ghost-types like Basculegion, Brambleghast, and Hisuian Typhlosion offensively, it struggles to switch into and take priority attacks from the former two, and more often that not, it will get outsped and KOed by the latter two. Revenge Killers: With Chandelure's middling Speed, even with Choice Scarf, it is quite easily revenge killed by faster threats. Most notably, faster Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Mienshao threaten Chandelure through their super effective STAB attacks or coverage, respectively."

    "text": "Charizard's high Speed, great Special Attack, and unique offensive and defensive typing make it a great all-out attacker, checking many common Grass-types like Whimsicott and Hisuian Decidueye. Charizard's Hurricane is one of its strongest attacks and has few common resistances. Flamethrower has more reliable accuracy than Hurricane, destroys Steel-types like Magneton and Orthworm that can otherwise handle Hurricane, and melts Ice-types like Frosmoth, Glastrier, and Sneasel. Scorching Sands covers Rock-types like Regirock and Rhydon, lets Charizard fish for burns, and is a more accurate move than Hurricane against foes like Typhlosion. Will-O-Wisp punishes physical attackers like Snorlax, Dudunsparce, and Regirock that would otherwise try to take advantage of Charizard. Tera Ground stops fast Electric-types like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Magneton from taking advantage of Charizard with Volt Switch and flips its major 4x Rock weakness into a resistance to better handle Sandaconda and Regirock. Offensively, Tera Ground gives Charizard great odds to 2HKO Lanturn and always 3HKO defensive Muk after Stealth Rock chip. Charizard appreciates pivots like Jolteon and Whimsicott bringing it in safely on Pokemon that check them like Orthworm and Magneton; Charizard also benefits from these teammates checking Water-types like Floatzel, Lanturn, and Clawitzer that it otherwise struggles with. Regirock is a great teammate for Charizard, as it can check special walls like Snorlax and Dunsparce for Charizard and is an even sturdier wall to the threats Charizard burns with Will-O-Wisp. Grass-type partners like Virizion, Hisuian Decidueye, and Dipplin cover Charizard's weaknesses and are complemented by Charizard handling Whimsicott. Charizard is a great check to Palossand, one of the toughest walls for Hisuian Sneasel and Toxicroak, so they benefit from having Charizard as a partner while they threaten one of Charizard's biggest checks in Regirock. After a Belly Drum, Charizard becomes a deadly sweeper capable of OHKOing most Pokemon that don't resist Acrobatics. Even physical walls like Weezing and Palossand are KOed by +6 Acrobatics after Stealth Rock damage. Earthquake wrecks bulky Pokemon that resist Acrobatics like Magneton, and at +6, Charizard's Earthquake OHKOes even Regirock after Stealth Rock damage, Rhydon after Spikes damage, and Naclstack. Earthquake has a small perk of avoiding negative contact effects such as Rocky Helmet damage from Qwilfish. Flame Charge makes Charizard harder to revenge kill by fast Pokemon like Jolteon and Choice Scarf Rotom, and at +6, it is likely to OHKO Orthworm after Stealth Rock damage. Sitrus Berry restores some of Charizard's health given that Stealth Rock and Belly Drum both take 50% of its HP, and it easily allows Charizard to consume its item and maximize damage from Acrobatics. Tera Flying boosts Acrobatics, allowing Charizard to reliably OHKO physical walls like Sandaconda and Palossand and take neutral damage from Aqua Jet users like Qwilfish and Veluza that can revenge kill it. Belly Drum Charizard usually has just one chance to sweep, so it primarily features on hyper offensive teams built around fast-paced setup sweepers. Charizard benefits immensely from teammates that set entry hazards, enabling it to OHKO foes like Palossand, Rhydon, and Regirock, all of which could otherwise survive its onslaught; offensive teammates like Hisuian Avalugg and Primeape can reliably set Stealth Rock, and Qwilfish and Hisuian Qwilfish can set Spikes for Charizard. Sandslash is an excellent partner for Charizard, as it can set up hazards, remove hazards with Rapid Spin, and check Rock- and Electric-types for Charizard. Parting Shot users like Grafaiai and Alolan Persian can weaken foes and ease Charizard's time setting up. Memento users like Mismagius and Whimsicott can put Charizard in a good position to sweep by debuffing foes. Offensive pivots like Mesprit and Whimsicott can bring Charizard into favorable matchups against Pokemon they lure in like Orthworm and Articuno. Other physical attackers like Hisuian Decidueye, Glastrier, and Toxicroak can break holes in teams so that Charizard can clean up afterwards, and they all appreciate its great Speed and potential to sweep. Charizard has Dragon Dance and Swords Dance in its arsenal for setting up without sacrificing half of its HP, but Charizard's Attack isn't amazing without multiple boosts, so Charizard needs teams to be significantly worn down before it can sweep. Solar Power might make Charizard look appealing as a sun attacker, but sun is an unreliable team style, Charizard is worn down quickly by Stealth Rock and Solar Power, and it faces competition from Scovillain as a sun sweeper. All-out attacker Charizard can run Focus Blast for greater damage against Rock-types, Snorlax, and Dudunsparce, but Scorching Sands has reliable accuracy and lets Charizard fish for burns on these targets. Belly Drum Charizard can run Tera Ground to turn the tables on Rock-types and Electric-types, and the boost in power to Earthquake lets Charizard reliably OHKO Regirock, Rhydon, and Naclstack. Tera Dark on Belly Drum Charizard can protect Charizard from moves affected by Prankster coming from foes like Grafaiai and Sableye. Faster Revenge Killers: Jolteon requires little chip damage to revenge kill Charizard, and Choice Specs Jolteon can OHKO Charizard outright. Choice Scarf users like Qwilfish, Magneton, and Rotom also have super effective STAB moves to revenge kill Charizard with less chip damage, and they also gain momentum against it with their pivot moves. Grafaiai, Sneasel, and Mismagius are strong attackers faster than Charizard, but few revenge killers can switch into it safely or repeatedly. Floatzel is unique as a fast physical revenge killer that doesn't fear burns thanks to Water Veil. Rock-types: Regirock and Rhydon are difficult for Charizard to break on its own, and both still threaten Charizard even when they're burned. Sturdy on Hisuian Avalugg can help it survive even a +6 Earthquake from Belly Drum Charizard and retaliate with a strong Mountain Gale or Rock Blast, but its low special bulk leaves it very vulnerable to all-out attacker Charizard. Naclstack is an excellent wall to all-out attacker Charizard thanks to Recover, Purifying Salt shielding it from burns, and great bulk with Eviolite, but Belly Drum Charizard can OHKO it with a +6 Earthquake. Specially Bulky Pokemon: Snorlax and Dudunsparce can use all-out attacker Charizard as an opportunity to set up. Dudunsparce can remain healthy with Roost, and Snorlax doesn't mind damage or burns thanks to Rest. Muk dislikes burns but can take repeated hits from Charizard and wear it down with Poison Jab and Knock Off. Bulky Water-types: Cramorant comfortably walls all-out attacker Charizard thanks to Roost. Lanturn only minds burns cutting into its passive recovery, and it can gain momentum from Charizard with Volt Switch or threaten to spread burns with Scald."

    "name": "Chien-Pao",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Chien-Pao possesses the coveted-yet-crowded base 135 Speed tier and can even get the jump on its peers with Ice Shard and Sucker Punch, making it a nice revenge killer and late-game cleaner; Ice Shard in particular stands out in a metagame with numerous fast Dragon-types. Its Dark / Ice STAB combination matches up well into defensive staples like Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Ting-Lu, and Icicle Crash can also potentially flinch through otherwise solid counterplay like Ho-Oh. However, Chien-Pao is exceedingly frail and entry hazard-weak, making getting it onto the field safely, let alone multiple times, quite difficult. This also means it offers exactly no defensive utility to its team. Due to the low Base Power of its moves, it is also relatively weak by Ubers standards without finding a turn to use Swords Dance, which is hard to find due to its frailty. Chien-Pao is also scared to death of Zacian-C, which outspeeds it and resists both STAB types. Kingambit also provides heavy competition, as it has substantially better bulk, resists Stealth Rock, and boasts an even stronger Sucker Punch late-game, at the cost of much worse Speed. Ultimately, Chien-Pao's Speed, priority, and STAB combination make it a noteworthy cleaner, but it still finds itself more limited compared to metagame staples like Koraidon and Zacian-C. Swords Dance Chien-Pao is a threatening late-game cleaner once Arceus formes that are not weak to Chien-Pao's STAB moves have been chipped sufficiently. Icicle Crash is Chien-Pao's strongest STAB move, provides key coverage against the plethora of Ground-types, and can provide a flinch in a pinch all while dodging Rocky Helmet. Crunch is Chien-Pao's most reliable secondary STAB move, hitting Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Water, and Kyogre, while Sucker Punch is its strongest priority move by far against neutral targets. Ice Shard is notable to revenge kill Koraidon and Miraidon while also not failing against setup moves and can be run over either Dark STAB move. Life Orb is the preferred item to secure the OHKO against defensive Necrozma-DM and 2HKO against Arceus-Water after Swords Dance, and given Chien-Pao’s frailty, the recoil is often insignificant. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Chien-Pao to be played aggressively in the early-to-mid-game to help break down the opposing core itself and pick off weakened targets, while Black Glasses still secures key KOs like Necrozma-DM without recoil. Jolly is the preferred nature to Speed tie Koraidon, Miraidon, and opposing Chien-Pao while outspeeding Arceus, Mewtwo, and +1 Necrozma-DM and Iron Treads, but Adamant is an option, especially on double priority sets that care less about the Speed tier. Chien-Pao thrives best when it is tasked with cleaning up a weakened team. As such, powerful physical wallbreakers like Koraidon and Arceus-Ground that can lure in and weaken their shared checks like Arceus-Fairy are excellent teammates. Chien-Pao also loves entry hazards being up on the opposing side, making teammates like Gliscor and Ting-Lu wonderful partners. Chien-Pao is helpless against Zacian-C, making a strong answer to it like Ho-Oh a great teammate. Additionally, strong opposing priority users like Arceus offset Chien-Pao's biggest advantage, so a reliable answer to it like defensive Arceus-Ground is recommended. Especially if running Life Orb, Chien-Pao struggles to get onto the field without taking tremendous chip damage, making pivoting teammates like Gliscor, Koraidon, and Miraidon valuable partners; Miraidon especially draws in the Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Gliscor that Chien-Pao feasts on. Extreme Killer Arceus is an excellent teammate, as they form a strong priority core together; Arceus also often forces Tera Ghost on opposing setup sweepers, making them weaker to Chien-Pao's Sucker Punch. Glimmora is a useful partner especially on hyper offense teams to provide entry hazard support and clear Stealth Rock with Mortal Spin. Choice Band gives Chien-Pao the best chance to 2HKO walls like Necrozma-DM and revenge kill Miraidon and Koraidon after moderate chip. Icicle Crash is the main STAB option thanks to its flinch chance and better Base Power while also avoiding Rocky Helmet, while Ice Spinner doesn't miss and can reset Miraidon's Electric Terrain. Crunch is its most reliable Dark-type STAB move, hitting Arceus-Water, Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM. Double priority in Sucker Punch and Ice Shard lets it pack both power and coverage, nailing anything that might be faster including Iron Bundle, Miraidon, and even Calyrex-I in Trick Room. Tera Dark and Ice can both be used to power up Chien-Pao's STAB attacks; Tera Ice has a chance to OHKO both Miraidon and Koraidon with Ice Shard, while Tera Dark secures the 2HKO against Ho-Oh and has a high chance to 2HKO Arceus-Water. Choice Band Chien-Pao is a useful revenge killer and wallbreaker for offensive teams. Since it forgoes Heavy-Duty Boots and would love to switch in multiple times to mitigate the effect of Choice-lock, it pairs well with Iron Treads, which can clear entry hazards and even pivot Chien-Pao in. Zacian-C can easily revenge kill Chien-Pao and even grab a Swords Dance if locked into Sucker Punch or Ice Shard, making strong counterplay like Landorus-T and defensive Arceus-Ground or revenge killers like Choice Scarf Koraidon mandatory teammates. Physically offensive teammates like Koraidon and Necrozma-DM appreciate being able to clean teams Chien-Pao has weakened; alternatively, they can punch holes for Chien-Pao to clean up. Extreme Killer Arceus is an excellent teammate, as it forms a powerful priority core with Chien-Pao and can draw out Tera Ghost for it. An all-out attacker set with Heavy-Duty Boots can be used for the maximum amount of coverage and priority while still changing moves in the early- and mid-game, but it generally lacks power compared to the above sets and struggles to even 2HKO defensive staples like Arceus. Sacred Sword provides coverage for Arceus and Kingambit and does non-pitiful damage to Zacian-C, but Chien-Pao struggles to justify it over its primary STAB moves and priority options. Tera Ghost can catch out Extreme Speed Arceus but otherwise is far worse than damage-amplifying Tera types. Focus Sash can be run on hyper offense structures to take a hit but requires significant entry hazard counterplay. Zacian-C: Zacian-C outspeeds Chien-Pao and resists its STAB combination. Defensive Arceus: Arceus-Water and -Fairy avoid the 2HKO from almost any of Chien-Pao's attacks and can retaliate with Will-O-Wisp or Judgement. Arceus-Fairy has a low chance to be 2HKOed by Life Orb Tera Ice Icicle Crash, however. Extreme Killer Arceus: Extreme Killer Arceus completely nullifies Chien-Pao's Speed and priority advantages while not being OHKOed by any common move. Choice Scarf users: Choice Scarf users like Koraidon can revenge kill Chien-Pao, especially with a well-timed Tera. Iron Bundle: Iron Bundle outspeeds Chien-Pao, can force 50/50s with Encore, and KOes it after some chip. Zamazenta: Zamazenta’s bulk lets it take any attack and OHKO with Body Press."

  "Cinccino": {
    "name": "Cinccino",
    "text": "Cinccino's blistering Speed and access to Technician, which it can fully take advantage of with Loaded Dice, make it a dangerous setup sweeper that can end games as easily as it can wallbreak for its partners. Passive Pokemon that might try to take advantage of Cinccino like Orthworm and Bronzong aren't safe from it either, as Cinccino can lock them into setting up entry hazards or using Iron Defense with its Encore, giving it free turns to boost with Tidy Up. On top of that, after a turn of setup, its myriad of coverage moves lets it beat anything from Unaware Quagsire to Flame Body Talonflame unharmed. However, Cinccino has terrible four-moveslot syndrome, and its STAB move can be easily punished by common Rocky Helmet users like Vileplume and Galarian Slowbro. Pokemon like Inteleon and Choice Scarf Mienshao can outpace it and threaten it with a KO, but they fail to check it after it boosts. Cinccino's Tidy Up is also a double-edged sword, as it needs the power to achieve many of its KOs, but in using the move, it removes the hazards that were helping limit its switch-ins in the first place, making it somewhat difficult to fit on many teams. Cinccino also struggles to find setup opportunities due its frailty typically only letting it survive one hit. Knock Off hits Ghost-types that blank Cinccino's STAB attack as well as Bronzong, and Bullet Seed hits certain physically defensive checks like Swampert, Vaporeon, and Quagsire. Encore allows Cinccino to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Swampert and Palossand that use Stealth Rock or heal up, which gifts it more setup opportunities. It also helps Cinccino handle slower setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Sylveon and Iron Defense Registeel and Orthworm. Alternatively, Rock Blast can be run to hit Talonflame to avoid Flame Body burns, and Triple Axel can be used as a strong coverage move to nail Brambleghast, Gligar, Flygon, and Dragalge. A Cinccino that aims to sweep teams should run Loaded Dice + Technician for maximum damage output. In contrast, if it chooses to be a dedicated lead, Focus Sash + Skill Link allows it to take advantage of both Tidy Up's entry hazard-clearing potential and its multi-hit moves. Tera Ghost allows Cinccino to become immune to Choice Scarf Mienshao and Infernape's Close Combat, and it lets Cinccino blank Breloom's Mach Punch and take advantage of it with Encore, giving Cinccino free turns to set up. However, Tera Fire can be useful to avoid burns from both Will-O-Wisp and Talonflame's Flame Body. Cinccino struggles with breaking through Steel-types like Copperajah, Orthworm, and Registeel, so partners such as Cresselia, Oricorio-E, Diancie, and Munkidori pair well, as they can help overwhelm these shared checks. Teammates that can benefit from Cinccino's Tidy Up removing hazards like Air Balloon Chandelure, Weakness Policy Incineroar, Choice Scarf Staraptor, and Kilowattrel enjoy its presence; on top of that, the former two can handle Steel-types easily with their STAB moves, whereas the latter two can help wear them down. Terrain teams can also take advantage of Cinccino's hazard clearing, as common Terrain sweepers like Oricorio-E, Galarian Articuno, and Grafaiai enjoy not being chipped by hazards. Due to them not being as concerned about Cinccino's Tidy Up removing their hazards, Stealth Rock leads like Eject Pack Flygon and Booster Energy Scream Tail pair best with it. Spikes leads like Froslass and Brambleghast can help wear down checks like Orthworm and Copperajah, and a Sticky Web lead like Galvantula can help Cinccino outspeed Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Munkidori; however, these teams must be wise about when to send out Cinccino to ensure their hazards aren't completely wasted. Physical walls that carry a way to punish contact moves through their ability like Talonflame and Vileplume or item users like Rocky Helmet Bellibolt and Galarian Slowbro are issues for Cinccino, so teammates with access to Knock Off such as Mienshao and Heracross can help deal with these walls. Cinccino's frailty often hinders its ability to set up, so partners that can create opportunities like Memento Chandelure or slow pivots like Dragalge and Incineroar are greatly appreciated. Protective Pads could be run to not be vulnerable to contact punishment, but with how Cinccino is then forced to use Skill Link, it becomes weaker. On teams that would like an offensive form of entry hazard control, Heavy-Duty Boots + Skill Link can be run on Cinccino alongside U-turn, letting it reliably remove hazards and bring in a wallbreaker for incoming Steel-types. However, the weaker power, along with the fact that there are better hazard removal options generally, causes it to be unused. Tera Blast Fire can be utilized on Cinccino to hit Rocky Helmet Vileplume and Steel-types like Orthworm and Copperajah, which it can have trouble dealing with otherwise, but Tera Blast being a wasted moveslot before Terastallization means that it's generally worse overall. Steel-types: Orthworm, Registeel, and Copperajah can take all of Cinccino's attacks comfortably and retaliate with a Body Press or powerful Iron Head; on top of that, the latter two can even paralyze and phaze it, respectively. Bronzong can also wall Cinccino and retaliate with Body Press, but it must beware of Knock Off. If any of them set up entry hazards or used Iron Defense as Cinccino came in, they are easily beat one-on-one due to its Encore. Contact Punishment: Pokemon like Flame Body Talonflame, Effect Spore Vileplume, and Static Bellibolt can all cripple Cinccino with a burn, poison, or paralysis, and Rocky Helmet users like the latter two and Galarian Slowbro can chip away heavily at Cinccino if it uses Tail Slap, opening it up to being revenge killed even more easily. However, Cinccino can run Rock Blast to take out Talonflame, Tera Fire to ignore burn attempts, and Knock Off to remove these crippling items. Revenge Killers: Fast Pokemon, such as Inteleon and Kilowattrel, and Choice Scarf users, like Mienshao and Munkidori, outspeed Cinccino and can threaten it with a KO if Cinccino hasn't boosted yet. On top of that, Pokemon with priority like Mach Punch Breloom and First Impression Flygon can revenge kill Cinccino as well. However, for some of these revenge killers, Cinccino can Terastallize into a Ghost-type and use Encore, which then provides it with setup opportunities."

  "Cinderace": {
    "name": "Cinderace",
    "text": "With its high Attack and Speed stats, coupled with Libero, Heavy-Duty Boots, U-turn, and a strong Fire-type attack in Pyro Ball, Cinderace is a great offensive pivot. Sucker Punch gives Cinderace priority and allows it to revenge kill faster threats such as Dragapult, Deoxys-S, weakened Iron Moth, and Terastallized Roaring Moon. Court Change offers great entry hazard control, getting rid of hazards against even Gholdengo and removing Alolan Ninetales's Aurora Veil in addition. Alternatively, High Jump Kick and Gunk Shot can be run as coverage options. The former OHKOes Roaring Moon and Hisuian Samurott as well as hitting non-Terastallized Garganacl for super effective damage. The latter can OHKO Ogerpon-W and deal with Fairy-types like Primarina, Hatterene, and Clefable, as well as having a good chance of poisoning switch-ins. With Tera Fire, Cinderace regains its original typing after a Libero type change, allowing it to OHKO unboosted Kingambit, defensive Gholdengo, and Iron Treads as well as 2HKO Hatterene and Clefable with Pyro Ball. However, after Terastallizing, Cinderace won't benefit from Libero anymore. Offensive Pivot Cinderace is a great option on bulky offense teams. Landorus-T and Galarian Slowking synergize well with Cinderace, as Landorus-T can check Great Tusk and Zamazenta, which are problematic for Cinderace, while Galarian Slowking can switch into strong special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Primarina along with helping to check Zamazenta. Furthermore Grass-type Pokemon like Rillaboom, Serperior, and Ogerpon-W can also help Cinderace, as they can handle Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Primarina, Hisuian Samurott, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Cinderace can bring these teammates in with U-turn. Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W are particularly helpful, as the former sets the Grassy Terrain that provides Cinderace with passive recovery and weakens Earthquake to let it stay in on Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Iron Treads, while the latter completely absorbs Water-type moves as well as benefiting from Cinderace’s ability to hit Grass-types and taking advantage of the hazard control it offers. Finally, Zamazenta also threatens Cinderace, so Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Enamorus can be helpful, and they can benefit from Cinderace's presence, as it can bring them in safely and remove entry hazards for them. Cinderace's bulky set revolves around the idea of maximizing its utility. U-turn keeps up momentum for its teammates and helps it to pivot out of bad matchups. Will-O-Wisp allows it to cripple physically offensive Pokemon like Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Court Change enables it to function as an entry hazard remover and one of the best answers to Sticky Web and dual screens teams. Heavy-Duty Boots is the best item for Cinderace, allowing it to spread status and remove hazards effectively. The set's EVs allow it to OHKO offensive Gholdengo with Pyro Ball. Blaze is the preferred ability to keep Cinderace's Fire-type defensive profile intact after using Court Change, maintaining a resistance to moves like Moonblast from Iron Valiant, Make It Rain from Gholdengo, and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom. Blaze also lets Cinderace keep its Fire STAB after using Court Change. Tera Fire provides a much-appreciated boost to Cinderace's Pyro Ball, while Tera Flying allows it to land a potential burn or get a free Court Change on Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu. Cinderace works best on bulky offense and balance teams, where it can support its team while keeping up offensive momentum. For example, Ogerpon-W loves having a partner that can remove hazards, and it can, in return, threaten Cinderace's checks like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Corviknight likes partnering with Cinderace because both of them can remove hazards, and Cinderace can force out Gholdengo. Dragapult appreciates Cinderace's ability to spread burns so that it can threaten foes with Hex. Landorus-T works well with Cinderace as a bulky Intimidate pivot, giving another layer of safety against physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Kingambit. Alomomola can also help to check and pivot around physical attackers, as well as providing Wish support to keep Cinderace healthy in longer battles. Pokemon like Gliscor and Heatran take little damage from Pyro Ball and are immune to Will-O-Wisp, and so Great Tusk makes a great Cinderace partner which can threaten them out while serving as another form of hazard removal. Primarina can also threaten Gliscor and Heatran, as well as handling Pokemon Cinderace cannot, such as Clodsire and Dondozo. Water-types that are not scared of Cinderace's Will-O-Wisp are also natural Cinderace answers, like Walking Wake and the aforementioned Primarina. Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon, and Rillaboom provide safety versus Primarina, and Rillaboom in particular has Grassy Terrain to negate Cinderace's weakness to Earthquake. Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Hatterene are always great options for not just Walking Wake, but also for the other Dragon-types in the tier that resist Cinderace's Pyro Ball and don't fear a burn like Raging Bolt. Both Iron Valiant and Enamorus appreciate Cinderace's U-turn to bring them in safely, and Hatterene appreciates having Cinderace as insurance to help with hazard control. Galarian Slowking is a good partner for Cinderace due to its ability to pivot with Chilly Reception, creating a strong defensive pivoting core; Galarian Slowking is also able to check special attackers like Walking Wake, while Cinderace returns the favor by checking physical attackers like Kingambit."

  "Clefable": {
    "name": "Clefable",
    "text": "Leveraging its passable bulk, amazing typing, solid movepool, and two fantastic abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware, Clefable establishes its niche in the OU tier as a solid glue on bulkier team compositions, which appreciate its amazing role compression. Clefable maximizes its physical bulk to handle a myriad of physical attackers and passive Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, Gliscor, and Garganacl. Clefable is an effective Stealth Rock user, as it threatens Great Tusk and can punish Corviknight with paralysis, lock it into Defog with Encore, or remove its item. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots to enable Clefable's Stealth Rock and teammates' Spikes. Clefable primarily uses Encore on Unaware sets, as it can force setup sweepers like Raging Bolt into uncomfortable positions, allowing one of its teammates to get a safe switch into the field. Thunder Wave cripples faster Pokemon like Zamazenta, Roaring Moon, and Weavile. While Moonlight is usually preferred as Clefable's recovery, Wish and Protect can be used over Moonlight and Stealth Rock, respectively, if Clefable's team already has another Stealth Rock user. Calm Mind can be used on Unaware sets to handle special-boosting attackers such as Darkrai and Hatterene. Sticky Barb + Trick can also be used on Magic Guard sets to incapacitate Gliscor, as Sticky Barb neutralizes Poison Heal recovery, crippling Gliscor's longevity; it also punishes common switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and Blissey while also generally being useful to steal items. Clefable uses Tera Water and Tera Steel to absorb Steel-type attacks in a pinch like Kingambit's Iron Head, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Iron Treads's Steel Beam. Tera Water is preferred due to its good matchups into the physical attackers Clefable aims to check, letting Clefable switch into Barraskewda and Cinderace while granting a good neutral defensive typing. Tera Steel can also be used to become immune to Poison-type attacks like Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb, but it loses key matchups like Cinderace, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. Tera Ghost is also a decent pick, as it preserves Clefable’s good matchups into Fighting-types while also letting it spinblock, but it has a worse matchup against Knock Off users. It's worth noting that Clefable prefers not to Terastallize unless it absolutely needs to, as its base typing is incredibly valuable. Rocky Helmet is also viable on Magic Guard sets as an effective way to punish U-turn and as a one time Knock Off punisher, although Clefable usually prefers Leftovers letting it beat stronger Pokemon one-on-one without needing to use Moonlight as frequently. Clefable fits on balance and stall teams that appreciate its role compression and typing. Teammates like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Clodsire love Clefable’s ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and enable their entry hazards. Gliscor, in particular, is a phenomenal teammate. The two are effective walls that cover each other’s physical weaknesses; Clefable can switch into Knock Off from threats that Gliscor cannot handle, namely Meowscarada, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile, threatening them out with Moonblast. In return, Gliscor can set Spikes, which when combined with Clefable’s Stealth Rock and the pair’s access to Knock Off, forms a potent hazard-stacking core. Galarian Slowking is similarly a good partner, as Clefable can handle many of the aforementioned Dark-types that threaten it. In return Galarian Slowking is an amazing special wall that switches into many strong special attacks that would threaten Clefable, such as Iron Moth's Sludge Wave and Primarina's Moonblast. It can also spread Toxic, which allows Clefable to stay in against physical attackers more comfortably. Encore’s ability to catch setup sweepers is appreciated by Clefable’s more offensively oriented teammates like Kingambit and Dragapult to give them a safe entry point. Additionally, it lets in more defensively oriented Pokemon, notably Alomomola, which can regenerate HP and pass Wish. Offensive partners appreciate Thunder Wave support to enable them to punish faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and opposing Dragapult. In exchange, Weavile and Meowscarada can remove Heavy-Duty Boots so Clefable's Stealth Rock can start racking up damage. Dragapult and Gholdengo are also effective partners, as they pressure or cripple common Pokemon that annoy Clefable and can also spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads. In return, Clefable threatens Dark-types while also forcing out Garganacl. Kingambit is a phenomenal partner, as it threatens common answers to Clefable such as Clodsire, Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo. Zamazenta pressures Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Heatran while equally enjoying Clefable handling Great Tusk and pestering Dragapult. Dragonite is also a decent partner, as it likes Clefable's ability to check and pressure Dragon-types as well as its Encore support, giving it more setup opportunities."

  "Cobalion": {
    "name": "Cobalion",
    "text": "Cobalion serves as one of the best Stealth Rock setters in the metagame due to its good matchups into the most common hazard removal options, Excadrill and Mandibuzz, while also being one of the best sponges for Lokix's First Impression. Volt Switch allows Cobalion to pivot out on would-be switch-ins such as Latios and Slowking and bring in a teammate to threaten them out. Thunder Wave can punish Tornadus-T and the aforementioned Latios for switching in, while Stone Edge can be used to hit Flying-types like Thundurus-T super effectively. Leftovers gives Cobalion more longevity, allowing it to check opposing threats for an extended period of time, while Rocky Helmet allows it to punish Lokix more easily and get chip damage on other contact moves users such as Scizor and Tyranitar. Shuca Berry is another option that allows Cobalion to switch into or stay in on Earthquakes from unboosted Excadrill. Tera Dragon gives Cobalion a resistance to Water-type attacks such as Surf from Greninja, which is then OHKOed back with Close Combat, while making it neutral to Ground and preserving its Grass resistance so it can still check Ogerpon. Tera Ghost allows it to preserve Stealth Rock in the event the opposing Excadrill uses its Tera to flip the matchup while also making Cobalion neutral to Ground-type attacks and immune to Fighting-type attacks such as Close Combat from Scizor and opposing Cobalion. Tera Flying gives it an immunity to Ground-type attacks, allowing it to more easily answer even a Speed-boosted Excadrill. However, Cobalion's base typing is very useful for answering threats like Lokix, Scizor, and Tyranitar, so it should usually only Terastalize if there is no other option at the time. Cobalion fits on Volt Turn offense, bulky offense, and balance teams, utilizing its good matchups into the most common hazard removal options to keep Stealth Rock up for a solid portion of the game while using Volt Switch to bring threats onto the field. Unfortunately, Cobalion doesn't resist Flying and Psychic, so alternative checks to threats like Tornadus-T and Latios are needed. Slowking can check both Latios and Tornadus-T while also providing Thunder Wave support so Cobalion is more free to use Taunt. In return, Cobalion can switch into Lokix and Scizor, which can threaten Slowking. Pivot Tornadus-T can act as a check to Latios while using Knock Off so that foes such as Slowking and Skeledirge are susceptible to Cobalion's Stealth Rock and U-turn to continue the pivot chain. Sandy Shocks and Thundurus-T can both switch into Zapdos and block Volt Switch while also applying pressure on Ground-types like Rhyperior, as well as Cobalion checks like Hydrapple and Latios. Cobalion is also threatened by Okidogi, so ways to offensively pressure it like Excadrill, Latios, and the previously mentioned Tornadus-T are appreciated. The latter two, alongside Grass-types like Hydrapple and Zarude, also provide a Ground resistance to help cover Cobalion's weakness. Excadrill, on the other hand, provides a Latios check that can remove hazards while also offensively checking Skeledirge and Toxapex. Choice Specs Greninja offensively pressures everything that can threaten Cobalion, and it appreciates Cobalion's ability to draw in foes and pivot on them alongside Stealth Rock for chipping Assault Vest Tornadus-T into Ice Beam range."

    "text": "With access to Triage, Draining Kiss, and Terastallization granting it perfect offensive coverage, Comfey is a formidable sweeper in UU, taking down dangerous offensive foes like Lokix, Hoopa-U, Quaquaval, and Greninja. Calm Mind amplifies the power of Comfey's Draining Kiss while also making it harder to take down, finding setup chances against common foes like Hydrapple, Tornadus-T, and defensive Zapdos. Tera Blast Ground allows Comfey to now target Steel-types, including Metagross, Excadrill, and Tinkaton as well as other Fairy-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Pecharunt, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Arcanine. Tera Ground also grants Comfey the ability to set up on foes like Zapdos and Thundurus-T and resist Poison-type attacks from Okidogi and Pecharunt. Taunt denies recovery chances against foes like Slowking, Zapdos, Toxapex, and Mandibuzz, notably blocking Toxic attempts from the latter two, allowing Comfey to set up Calm Mind more easily and capitalize on forced switches. Giga Drain is an option over Taunt to get heavy damage on Water-types such as Azumarill and Slowking as well as other foes like Mamoswine, Rhyperior, and Hisuian Arcanine. A Life Orb grants Comfey an immediate power boost and works in tandem with the self-healing nature of Draining Kiss. 16 Speed EVs let Comfey outspeed foes such as Volcanion and Metagross, with the remaining investment in HP and Special Attack to maximize bulk and power. Comfey best fits on offense teams that wear down its checks to pave way for a sweep. Entry hazard leads like Mew and Excadrill provide key support in wearing down foes like Azumarill and Assault Vest Tornadus-T into Comfey's KO range. Mew in particular can cripple enemy Excadrill with Will-O-Wisp, allowing Comfey to no longer fear revenge killing attempts, while Excadrill can take out Tera Steel Latios. Ogerpon-C and Mimikyu are great teammates that offensively pressure bulky Pokemon such as Skeledirge and Slowking that trouble Comfey as well as wear down Tinkaton into range of Tera Blast Ground. Greninja and Azumarill are able to put pressure on the likes of Scizor and Hisuian Arcanine and are generally not reliant on Terastallization, meaning Comfey can use the mechanic more easily. Revavroom can take advantage of checks like Toxapex, Scizor, and Pecharunt and power through them while opening up holes against the enemy team for Comfey to clean. Quaquaval and Thundurus-T can take out Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross in the event Tera has already been used to still ensure Comfey can sweep; the former switches into Hisuian Arcanine, while the latter powers through Toxapex. Serperior and the aforementioned Quaquaval also threaten annoyances like Excadrill, Mamoswine, and Rhyperior."

  "Conkeldurr": {
    "name": "Conkeldurr",
    "text": "Conkeldurr menaces the metagame with nigh unparalleled breaking power and late-game cleaning potential. In a tier with a plethora of Fighting-types to choose from, such as Slither Wing, Galarian Zapdos, and Terrakion, Conkeldurr stands out because of its access to priority in Mach Punch and resilience to status, making defensive counterplay limited. Although it relies on a status affliction that wears it down gradually to reach these heights, Conkeldurr functions as a sturdy and reliable wallbreaker that can blow holes through teams with boosted Facade and Close Combat. Bulk Up variants of Conkeldurr are difficult to take down, taking advantage of its enormous HP stat and utilizing Drain Punch for recovery. Despite a low Speed stat rendering it more difficult to maneuver than other Fighting-type wallbreakers, Conkeldurr is fast enough and potent enough to warrant consideration on many team structures. A significant factor keeping Conkeldurr from being the consensus choice for teams as a wallbreaker is its generally slow Speed tier and the rate at which it can be worn down through burn damage and entry hazard chip. Flame Orb Conkeldurr is among the best wallbreakers in the metagame, taking advantage of Guts to elevate its enormous Attack stat to practically unwallable levels. Facade, boosted by Guts and Flame Orb, dishes out enormous damage to bulky Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Amoonguss and Slowbro. Drain Punch can be used to give Conkeldurr improved longevity, as it gets worn down by its burn. Knock Off helps break through Ghost- and Psychic-types like Palossand and Slowbro, removes Rocky Helmet from common checks like Chesnaught and Hippowdon, and is generally a safe attack to use for item removal that enables entry hazard chip damage to accrue. Mach Punch is used to revenge kill setup sweepers like Bisharp, Revavroom, and Terrakion if they're in KO range. Flame Orb is a necessary evil to activate Guts, though it does prevent Conkeldurr from getting paralyzed and allows it to function as a status absorber and Knock Off switch-in after activation if needed. 164 Speed EVs are used to outspeed the likes of Chesnaught, Umbreon, and Galarian Weezing. Tera Steel flips the weaknesses to Fairy-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks into important resistances, giving Conkeldurr the needed defensive utility to take out some of its own checks like Fezandipiti, Galarian Zapdos, and Gardevoir. It does, however, make Fighting-types like opposing Conkeldurr, Chesnaught, and Slither Wing more difficult to match up against. Tera Normal similarly has defensive value in removing all of Conkeldurr's weaknesses, with the offensive boost to Facade enabling Conkeldurr to push past any defensive wall in the metagame, notably being able to 2HKO Chesnaught, Slowbro, and Galarian Weezing. Balance and bulky offense teams appreciate Conkeldurr's ability to break through walls and assert dominant offensive pressure, as well as shoring up the matchup against offensive structures with strong priority in the form of Mach Punch. While Conkeldurr has great natural bulk, it does struggle to maintain health, as it gets worn down by burn and affected by entry hazard damage, so teammates that can remove hazards and give it safe entry points by pivoting, like Cyclizar and Noivern, are appreciated immensely. Fezandipiti can similarly give Conkeldurr safe entry points and serves as a defensive partner that can absorb the Fairy-type attacks thrown at it from the likes of opposing Fezandipiti and Galarian Weezing. Steel-type teammates like Jirachi and Assault Vest Magnezone are capable of taking Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from threats like Gardevoir and Noivern and providing additional pivot support. Offensive structures can use Conkeldurr as a mid-game wallbreaker to free up late-game setup sweepers, like Maushold and Mimikyu, that struggle to break through defensive walls like Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Galarian Weezing, all of which find it difficult to wall Conkeldurr despite their hefty physical bulk. Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Jirachi are notable teammates that can use Thunder Wave to spread paralysis, slowing down the opposition enough to allow Conkeldurr to outpace and blow through most of the unboosted metagame. Wish support from teammates like Jirachi and Umbreon can provide additional healing to offset the damage Conkeldurr accrues through hazard chip and burn damage. Defog Conkeldurr is a last-ditch entry hazard removal option for offensive teams that struggle to fit the standard hazard control options. Bulk Up is an exceptional setup move for Conkeldurr that opt for Leftovers over Flame Orb, improving longevity at the cost of immediate damage output. Entry Hazards and Rocky Helmet: Conkeldurr struggles to retain health due to burn chip damage, and any damage accumulated by entry hazards exacerbates this issue further. Teams that can maintain Stealth Rock and a Spikes layer with hazard setters like Chesnaught, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon force significant damage against Conkeldurr every time it enters the field, making it easier to revenge kill with faster Pokemon like Fezandipiti, Gardevoir, and Gengar. Rocky Helmet users like Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Hippowdon give Conkeldurr problems, as it takes recoil damage and accelerates its knockout. Faster Wallbreakers: After Conkeldurr claims a KO, faster wallbreakers and setup sweepers like Armarouge, Salamence, and Yanmega can take advantage of the free entry point to threaten to revenge kill Conkeldurr, giving them an opportunity to set up on a switch. Similarly, Volcanion and Choice item wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Slither Wing can take the turn to threaten strong STAB attacks on Conkeldurr's team."

  "Corviknight": {
    "name": "Corviknight",
    "text": "Corviknight is a fantastic utility Pokemon in the OU metagame. Its great typing, access to Roost, immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and neutrality to Stealth Rock allow it to stave off a number of key threats such as Meowscarada, Kingambit, and Iron Defense Zamazenta while granting its teammates safe switch-ins with its slow U-turn. Body Press is the primary attacking move, allowing Corviknight to deal high damage to Pokemon such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott. U-turn allows Corviknight to pivot out of stalemates and bad matchups. It is particularly useful against Gliscor and Gholdengo, as Gliscor will be unable to cripple Corviknight's partner with Knock Off or Toxic, while Gholdengo will be unable to exploit Corviknight and its Air Balloon will be popped, allowing Corviknight's teammates such as Great Tusk to more easily make progress against it. Iron Defense powers up Body Press and allows Corviknight to more reliably check Pokemon such as Kingambit and Iron Defense Zamazenta lacking Roar. Brave Bird is another option to more reliably make progress against Tera Ghost Pokemon and deal high damage to Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom. Defog is another option, as it allows Corviknight to clear entry hazards against non-Gholdengo teams. Thanks to Pressure, Corviknight can PP stall certain entry hazard setters such as Gliscor and Clefable, with it effectively having higher Defog PP than Stealth Rock or Spikes and making it effective at removing entry hazards against bulkier teams. Leftovers allows Corviknight to continuously stay healthy and recover from potential Stealth Rock chip damage, which will wear it down over time. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet lets Corviknight punish key physical attackers such as Meowscarada, Weavile, and Kingambit. 120 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and either set up Iron Defense or attack it with Body Press. However, Corviknight loses a considerable amount of bulk and its slow U-turn, which can be detrimental when pivoting to one of its teammates. Corviknight is a poor Terastallization candidate due to it losing its near-complete immunity to entry hazards. Nonetheless, it can use Tera to secure an endgame sweep with Iron Defense and Body Press or emergency check certain threats. Tera Water improves Corviknight's matchup against Fire-types such as Cinderace and Heatran, as well as Weavile. Tera Fighting lets Corviknight check Kingambit better and powers up its Body Press. Tera Grass or Tera Dragon can also be used to improve Corviknight's matchup against Ogerpon-W. Corviknight best fits on balance and stall teams looking for a defensive pivot and Knock Off absorber. Wallbreakers such as Meowscarada, Dragapult, and Weavile all pair well with Corviknight, as it can safely bring them in with its slow U-turn. All of the aforementioned partners are notably able to make progress against Gliscor, which Corviknight itself has trouble doing. Meowscarada and Weavile in particular are great partners, as they can also remove Rocky Helmet from opposing Corviknight, Skarmory, and Landorus-T, which can otherwise wear down Corviknight as it goes for one of its attacking moves. Special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Clodsire appreciate Corviknight's ability to handle physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott. In turn, they can handle the many special attackers that can threaten Corviknight such as Gholdengo and Walking Wake. Corviknight can struggle with being worn down over time by Stealth Rock chip damage, losing its Leftovers to Knock Off, and Taunt preventing it from using Roost. Corviknight also struggles to make progress against certain threats that can switch in on it freely, such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Moltres. Gholdengo is a particularly annoying matchup for Corviknight, as it also prevents it from using Defog due to Good as Gold. Alomomola can keep Corviknight healthy with Wish and pivot into Fire-type attacks. Tera Water Garganacl and Ting-Lu are good checks to Gholdengo and Dragapult, and they appreciate Corviknight's ability to keep entry hazards off the field. Kingambit is also a good partner, as it does an adequate job at checking Gholdengo and Dragapult while also punishing opposing Tera Ghost Kingambit, which could otherwise set up on Corviknight. Heatran is another difficult matchup for Corviknight, as it can safely set up Stealth Rock against Corviknight while threatening it with Magma Storm. Partners that can deal with Heatran, such as Gliscor or the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Alomomola, are thus recommended."

  "Crabominable": {
    "name": "Crabominable",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1 point Overview: Crabominable is a powerful wallbreaker that tries using Iron Fist alongside a supreme offensive typing and slew of punching moves to smash through its foes. Unfortunately, it is too slow to take advantage of its Attack stat, since it is naturally outsped by most Pokemon. Along with that, it is too frail and has a poor defensive typing, which does it absolutely no favors to tank hits, meaning it is often KOed before it gets to hit back. Wallbreaker: Leveraging its high Attack stat and vast movepool to dismantle defensive cores, Crabominable's STAB combination allows it to hit a wide range of common threats super effectively, making it a choice for teams looking to break through bulky opponents; that is, if it can get off any attacks. Primary STAB Moves: Ice Hammer, Ice Punch, Drain Punch, Close Combat, Body Press Setup Moves: Bulk Up, Iron Defense Utility Moves: Brick Break, Knock Off Coverage: Crabhammer, Earthquake, Gunk Shot, Iron Head, Liquidation, Rock Slide, Thunder Punch, Zen Headbutt Focus Punch: If Crabominable is able to force its foe out, Iron Fist-boosted Focus Punch can deliver a powerful attack to the incoming Pokemon. Endure: Due to Crabominable's low Speed, an Endure + Custap Berry set can be utilized well to dish out one last attack before fainting. Choice Band: Choice Band gives a much-needed boost to all of Crabominable's moves, but making the correct predictions is especially important with it, as using the wrong move likely results in it getting KOed in return. Damage-boosting Items: Life Orb and Expert Belt allow Crabominable to switch moves while still outputting high damage. Punching Glove can also be useful, allowing it to avoid adverse contact effects while stacking with Iron Fist. Eject Pack: With Ice Hammer, Eject Pack allows Crabominable to get a big attack off while generating momentum and avoiding having to take a hit itself the following turn. Assault Vest: Although Crabominable is not particularly bulky even with an Assault Vest, it can be used to tank a key hit. Heavy-Duty Boots: Since Crabominable is prone to chip from entry hazard damage, Heavy-Duty Boots is an option against teams that can easily set hazards. Crabominable should not be a Tera Captain. It has little to gain offensively, and although changing its type does help it defensively, its frailty means it still gets KOed regardless. If it were to be a Tera Captain, it can benefit slightly from defensive types like Tera Water and Fairy as well as Tera Ice and Fighting to boost its STAB moves further. Crabominable should not be the cornerstone of a draft in any sense of the term, meaning it needs a team that can function without it. Due to its abysmal Speed stat, it is outclassed by far too many other wallbreakers and should only be drafted on hyper offense drafts that do not need a cheap one-point entry hazard setter like Cutiefly and Glimmet. Residual Damage: Crabominable is very prone to damage from entry hazards, pivot moves, Rocky Helmet, and more, and due to its relative frailness, it does not need much damage from any of these sources to get KOed. Faster Offensive Threats: Considering most offensive Pokemon are faster than Crabominable, they can easily force it out, but defensive Pokemon need to find a way to get them in safely. Physically Defensive Pokemon: Physical walls that can shrug off Crabominable's STAB options such as Metagross, Toxapex, and Galarian Weezing can all switch into it and force it out in varied ways."

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "name": "Crawdaunt",
    "text": "The big bad crawdad of competitive Pokemon, Crawdaunt remains a relevant wallbreaker and stall dismantler several generations after its debut. Choice Band and Adaptability make switching into Crawdaunt nigh impossible, as it fires off massive Knock Offs and Crabhammers. With little regard to physical walls' existence, Crawdaunt excels in taking advantage of safe entry points provided by teammates to force concessions every time it hits the field, as switching into the combination of Dark- and Water-type attacks is difficult for even the bulkiest of walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. With access to Aqua Jet, Crawdaunt can overcome its relative slowness against offensive foes, picking up KOs and dealing big damage before it can be taken out in return. Unfortunately, Crawdaunt is still a bit slow and frail and competes for a spot against notable faster and bulkier wallbreakers like Volcanion, Slither Wing, and Terrakion. Along with the lack of Speed, Crawdaunt also suffers from a frailness that makes it susceptible to being taken out by the faster Pokemon in the metagame like Gardevoir, Kleavor, and Galarian Zapdos. Swords Dance Crawdaunt functions as an unstoppable wallbreaker and setup sweeper, capable of dismantling defensive cores with ease while threatening offense with strong priority. Aqua Jet ensures an already set up Crawdaunt can fire off strong attacks before being revenge killed, preventing faster Pokemon like Flygon, Gardevoir, and Thundurus from stopping a potential sweep. Adaptability-boosted Knock Off is Crawdaunt's most spammable attack, providing utility in item removal with the benefit of being incredibly difficult to switch into generally. Life Orb maximizes the breaking potential of Crawdaunt, enabling it to comfortably 2HKO nearly the entire unboosted metagame, including notable walls like Amoonguss, Galarian Weezing, and Slowbro. Crawdaunt does not get much value from using Terastallization, as the interaction between Terastallization and Adaptability provides minimal gain generally, but Tera Water is still the default choice to boost damage output for Aqua Jet while also removing the weakness to Bug and Fighting, which can prevent it from getting revenge killed by First Impression users Flygon and Slither Wing, as well as Mach Punch Conkeldurr. Balance and bulky offense teams looking for a powerful wallbreaker, setup sweeper, and priority revenge killer can use Swords Dance Crawdaunt to fill all of these roles comfortably. As one of the strongest physical attackers in the metagame, Crawdaunt often is paired with strong Volt Switch users, namely Magnezone and Thundurus, to form a dynamic duo that keeps the opponent from getting comfortable, as specially defensive walls like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon get worn down quickly trying to keep pace with the pivoting. Similarly, other strong physical setup sweepers, like Dragon Dance Flygon and Salamence, can take advantage of Crawdaunt racking up massive damage on physically defensive walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro to secure their own late-game sweep. However, Crawdaunt is often on a time crunch with regards to health, as it takes all forms of entry hazard chip damage in addition to its own Life Orb recoil and potential Rocky Helmet chip, making hazard removal teammates that can pivot Crawdaunt in safely like Cyclizar, Noivern, and Talonflame crucial to minimize the damage it takes and provide safe entry points against common switch-ins like Hippowdon, Hisuian Goodra, and Slowbro. Teams that utilize Crawdaunt often want to support it with their own hazards to capitalize on its strong Knock Off, making partners like Chesnaught, Jirachi, and Klefki valuable as both hazard setters and defensive pivots into Electric- and Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Thundurus and Slither Wing. Defensive teammates like Bellibolt, Empoleon, and Fezandipiti can provide immense value as switch-ins to revenge killers like Galarian Zapdos and Gardevoir while being able to provide safe pivots into Crawdaunt. Chesnaught and Wo-Chien are two of the few reliable Crawdaunt counters in the metagame, making teammates that can handle them like Ribombee and Galarian Zapdos appreciated. Choice Band Crawdaunt dishes out massive damage with every attack it uses, making it a seemingly unwallable wallbreaker. Aqua Jet functions as a STAB priority attack that allows Crawdaunt to overcome its relative slowness, picking up valuable revenge kills and chip damage on faster threats like Armarouge, Maushold, and Galarian Zapdos. Close Combat gives Crawdaunt additional breaking power against Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon like Bisharp and Hisuian Goodra. Adaptability, in conjunction with Crabhammer and Knock Off, renders physical walls neutral to its STAB attacks like Amoonguss and Galarian Weezing unable to weather the storm as Crawdaunt 2HKOes them with ease. Tera Water does not get much value offensively, as Adaptability offsets a majority of the boost provided by Terastallization, so Crawdaunt does not often Terastallize outside of the rare instances where it can improve a damage roll against a foe. Tera Water does remove Crawdaunt's weaknesses to common priority attacks like First Impression and Mach Punch, though it also eliminates the Adaptability boost for Knock Off, which is a tough concession to make. Balance and bulky offense teams needing a reliable Knock Off user and wallbreaker appreciate Crawdaunt's ability to do both well. Teammates like Cyclizar, Slither Wing, and Galarian Zapdos can pivot to Crawdaunt against incoming physical walls, such as Amoonguss, Hippowdon, and Slowbro, to provide safe opportunities to use its raw power to break holes into the opposition. Cyclizar and Noivern are exceptional teammates, as they can both pivot and remove entry hazards from the field, which Crawdaunt appreciates to retain health throughout a game. Similarly, defensive partners like Bellibolt and Magnezone can slowly pivot to Crawdaunt, providing valuable entry points against bulkier walls like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon. Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Krookodile appreciate Crawdaunt's ability to break through defensive Pokemon like Galarian Weezing, Hisuian Goodra, and Umbreon, enabling them to clean late-game. Slowbro and Jirachi provide speed control in the form of Thunder Wave, giving valuable opportunities for Crawdaunt to break through faster Pokemon like Jirachi, Terrakion, and Volcanion. Defensive teammates that can absorb Fairy- and Fighting-type attacks from revenge killers like Gardevoir and Mienshao are a necessity for Crawdaunt, making Fezandipiti a key teammate that can take attacks and provide safe entry points with U-turn. Hazard stacking cores, with setters like Chesnaught, Jirachi, and Klefki, can use Crawdaunt's Knock Off as a way to remove Heavy-Duty Boots while forcing switches, accruing damage quickly. A Jolly nature Crawdaunt Dragon Dance improves Crawdaunt's Speed enough to outpace notable threats like Kleavor and Mienshao after just one boost. Liquidation can be used over Crabhammer for a more accurate attack. Covert Cloak allows Crawdaunt to set up against Scald users, like Slowbro and Suicune, without fear of getting burned. Faster Wallbreakers: Crawdaunt struggles to keep pace against offensive teams, often relying on Aqua Jet, as it can't outspeed the opposition. Faster wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos, Slither Wing, and Gardevoir threaten to KO Crawdaunt before it can leverage its absurd offensive output for balance teams reliant on it. Water-type Pokemon: Gastrodon and Volcanion, because of their abilities Storm Drain and Water Absorb, respectively, prevent Crawdaunt from freely using Crabhammer to power its way through teams. Suicune does not have an immunity to Water but does prevent Crawdaunt from staying in comfortably by threatening Scald burns, while Barraskewda can use the threat of Close Combat to pivot into more favorable matchups. Entry Hazards and Rocky Helmet: Coming in multiple times throughout a game to fire off massive attacks is Crawdaunt's specialty, which makes it susceptible to getting worn down by entry hazards. Similarly, Rocky Helmet Pokemon like Amoonguss and especially Chesnaught cause problems for Crawdaunt, racking up chip damage while making Crawdaunt far less imposing by recovering their health back. Grass-type Pokemon: Amoonguss and Chesnaught are two defensive Grass-types that can often switch into Crawdaunt's STAB attacks and recover off most of the damage, with both threatening to KO it back with Giga Drain and Body Press, respectively. Wo-Chien similarly can take many of Crawdaunt's strongest attacks and recover HP back with Leech Seed. Hisuian Lilligant is a niche offensive pick but matches up well into Crawdaunt, using it to set up Victory Dance and threaten a sweep late-game."

  "Cresceidon": {
    "name": "Cresceidon",
    "text": "Cresceidon is a fantastic wall that can fit on most balance and bulky offense teams thanks to its great defensive typing, incredible base 124 Speed, and two amazing defensive abilities in Multiscale and Rough Skin. Thunder Wave allows it to cripple foes that outspeed it, such as Stratagem, Deoxys-S, and Choice Scarf Enamorus, while Encore punishes setup sweepers and slower Pokemon using their utility moves. The combination of Heavy-Duty Boots and Multiscale allows Cresceidon to withstand practically any hit regardless of entry hazards set on the field, making it an effective defensive pivot. It also allows Cresceidon to be used as a \"Get Out of Jail Free Card\" by being thrown in front of almost any wallbreaker or sweeper and stopping it in its tracks by tanking a hit and paralyzing the foe. Rocky Helmet in conjunction with Rough Skin can be utilized instead to punish foes using contact moves such as Landorus-T's U-turn and Weavile's Triple Axel. It also punishes opponents who try to mindlessly use Knock Off with Pokemon like Arghonaut, Great Tusk, and Roaring Moon. Cresceidon can use Tera Poison to avoid being poisoned by Venomicon and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb and foes using Toxic while also checking Hemogoblin better. Tera Dragon is an option to shed its Electric and Grass weaknesses, becoming a solid check to foes such as Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Caribolt. Hex Dragapult is a fantastic partner, checking the Electric- and Grass-types that threaten Cresceidon and running through paralyzed foes. Despite its commendable bulk and Fairy typing, Cresceidon is not the best Knock Off switch-in, as Heavy-Duty Boots aids it in soft-checking foes like Gholdengo and Stratagem. As such, a second Knock Off switch-in such as Gliscor, Skarmory, or Landorus-T is appreciated. If Rocky Helmet is the preferred item, then hazard removal options such as Equilibra, Great Tusk, and Corviknight help Cresceidon stay healthy. Equilibra is generally a great match with Cresceidon, taking on Electric-types such as Caribolt and Raging Bolt for it, while Cresceidon answers Water- and Fire-types such as Arghonaut, Walking Wake, and Cinderace. Together, they also can effectively check Hemogoblin without needing to expend Terastallization, as Equilibra can outspeed paralyzed Hemogoblin and OHKO most variants with Earth Power. Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Garganacl all alleviate Cresceidon's status weakness by switching into Toxic and Thunder Wave from the opponent's walls. Haze can remove boosts from setup sweepers that are faster than Cresceidon such as Swords Dance Iron Valiant and +1 Speed Caribolt, but Encore and Thunder Wave have broader use cases. Ice Beam is an option to beat Gliscor more consistently, but provides very little coverage otherwise. Bulky Poison-types: Venomicon, Mollux, and Galarian Slowking can all take advantage of Cresceidon's typing and threaten it with their Poison-type moves. The former two can also use it as an opportunity to set hazards, while the latter can use Future Sight. Plasmanta stonewalls Cresceidon, resisting Moonblast and being immune to Scald and Thunder Wave while simultaneously threatening it out with its STAB options. Krilowatt: Krilowatt is largely unbothered by Cresceidon's moves and threatens it with Thunderbolt or the opportunity to pivot with Volt Switch into one of its teammates that also threaten Cresceidon. Grass-types: Offensive Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, Caribolt, and Rillaboom can threaten Cresceidon out with their Grass-type STAB moves or annoy it with Knock Off. Malaconda is bulky enough to set sun and pivot out with Parting Shot, all while threatening to cripple Cresceidon with Knock Off or Glare. None of them appreciate being paralyzed or burned, however, so they cannot switch in completely freely. Snaelstrom: If Snaelstrom is already poisoned, it can use Cresceidon lacking Encore as setup fodder or at the bare minimum as an opportunity to set or remove hazards. It also threatens it with the somewhat rare Toxic. However, it cannot switch in before its Poison Heal has activated in fear of getting burned by Scald or paralyzed by Thunder Wave, as both render it effectively useless. Status: Cresceidon despises every status condition, as burn and poison both interfere with its Multiscale, while paralysis undermines its defining characteristic in its great Speed."

    "text": "This analysis was uploaded prior to The Indigo Disk release and may contain outdated information. Calm Mind Cresselia is a potent late-game wincon thanks to its gargantuan bulk, reliable recovery, and access to Calm Mind + Stored Power as well as solid coverage to deal with the Dark-types. After several Calm Mind boosts, Stored Power allows Cresselia to muscle past both Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo and bulky Psychic-resistant foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Heatran while making it nigh impossible to KO with special attackers. Moonblast rounds out Cresselia's coverage, allowing it to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Greninja super effectively while being able to at least damage Kingambit; Tera Blast Fighting greatly improves Cresselia's matchup against Kingambit and hits these Dark-types harder than Moonblast, but makes Cresselia more reliant on Terastallization. Leftovers grants Cresselia crucial passive healing, allowing it to conserve its limited Moonlight PP long-term; Covert Cloak, on the other hand, blocks secondary effects from an array of moves, including Heatran's Magma Storm, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Zapdos's Discharge, and Sneasler's Dire Claw, allowing Cresselia to set up against these threats more safely. Grassy Seed is an option if Cresselia is used on Grassy Terrain hyper offense teams, which gives it more opprotunities to set up in the face of physical attackers while also boosting its Stored Power. Tera Poison has wonderful synergy with Levitate, giving Cresselia a single weakness to Psychic-type attacks, granting it resistances to Poison- and Fairy-type attacks, and an immunity to Toxapex's Toxic while still maintaining its Fighting resistance. Defensively, Tera Fighting lets Cresselia flip its Dark weakness against prominent Pokemon like Meowscarada, Greninja, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Kingambit as well. 52 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Kingambit. Cresselia fits well on an array of hyper offense, offense, and balance teams capable of supporting such a potent wincon. Heatran, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T can provide entry hazard support to wear down foes over time. Heatran can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Kingambit or trap and wear down threats like Haze Toxapex and Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking with Magma Storm and Taunt; in return, Cresselia can handle threats like Great Tusk and Zamazenta that Heatran struggles against. Kingambit is ubiquitous and is a major thorn in Cresselia's side; as such, Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Low Kick Kingambit are crucial partners that can help stop opposing Kingambit's attempt to countersweep. Assault Vest Toxapex is a great teammate for Cresselia; it can take on Encore Iron Valiant, which is a frustrating matchup for Cresselia, and it can trap and deal with opposing defensive Toxapex, which can shut down Cresselia's boosts with Haze and force Cresselia to Tera Poison in order to avoid being crippled by Toxic. Thanks to Grassy Surge, Rillaboom is a necessary partner for Grassy Seed variants; it can support Cresselia with utility options like Knock Off and U-turn too."

  "Cryogonal": {
    "name": "Cryogonal",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 3-4 points Overview: Cryogonal is drafted almost solely for its access to Rapid Spin. As a low-tier spinner, it sets itself apart with a solid Speed tier, fantastic special bulk, the ability to beat Water-types with Freeze-Dry, and Levitate, providing useful immunities to Spikes and Ground-type attacks. Combined with access to Recover, Cryogonal has the potential longevity needed to provide support throughout a game. However, it has many flaws, most notably a pure Ice typing leaving it defensively compromised, very poor physical bulk meaning it's KOed by almost any decently strong physical attack, and a severe lack of offensive coverage options despite a somewhat usable Special Attack stat. Rapid Spin Support: Rapid Spin is the main reason to use Cryogonal, taking the pressure off of higher-tier Pokemon to spin for their team, allowing them to explore other options. Cryogonal can achieve this by switching into special attacks and using its great Speed to provide fast Rapid Spins. Other moveslots can be filled with your choice of STAB move and what few other support options Cryogonal has available, such as Recover, dual screens, and Haze. Heavy-Duty Boots is practically mandatory due to Cryogonal being weak to Stealth Rock. Primary STAB Moves: Ice Beam, Freeze-Dry, Blizzard Setup Moves: Nothing of note Utility Moves: Rapid Spin, Light Screen, Reflect, Haze, Recover, Protect Coverage: Flash Cannon, Ancient Power, Water Pulse, Tera Blast Icy Wind / Scary Face: These moves are used for their ability to lower opposing Pokemon's Speed stats, such as those of opposing sweepers, allowing Cryogonal's slower teammates to come in and threaten them. Icy Wind has the benefit of also doing damage, while Scary Face has a stronger Speed reduction alongside perfect accuracy, giving it an edge if damage is not required. Frost Breath: If facing foes attempting to boost their Special Defense stats, Frost Breath can be used for its guaranteed critical hit, allowing Cryogonal to cut through opposing boosts and deal maximum damage. Explosion: Due to Cryogonal's low Attack stat, Explosion will not be doing much damage. In this instance, it is used as a momentum tool, such as after Cryogonal has set dual screens, allowing a teammate to come in safely and attempt to set up on the foe. Chilling Water: Chilling Water can disrupt many physical Pokemon that Cryogonal baits in due to lowering the target's Attack stat. While this doesn't help Cryogonal much due to how low its Defense stat is, it allows Cryogonal's teammates to hit the field a little more safely. Ice Shard: Similarly to Explosion, Ice Shard doesn't do much in terms of damage, but it has a slight niche due to being a priority move, allowing Cryogonal to pick off setup sweepers, Pokemon that have activated Sturdy, and other similar foes that have very low HP. Heavy-Duty Boots: Since Cryogonal's main role is to clear the field of entry hazards, it will most likely be switching into battle with Stealth Rock active. Since it is weak to Rock, Cryogonal benefits from Heavy-Duty Boots removing the harsh damage it would otherwise sustain from simply attempting to clear away Stealth Rock. Light Clay: When used to set dual screens, Cryogonal can use Light Clay to extend their duration, giving teammates a longer period of opposing damage reduction. Leftovers: In the unlikely event that Stealth Rock is not a worrying factor, Cryogonal can make great use of Leftovers to keep itself healthy while using Levitate to avoid all other entry hazards. This combined with Recover provides potential longevity in the face of special attackers. Choice Specs: Having access to the rare Freeze-Dry and a good Speed stat, Cryogonal can take advantage of teams lacking in Ice-resistant Pokemon. Due to not having access to boosting moves of its own, Choice Specs can be used to increase Cryogonal's damage output. While this set can catch opponents off guard, it is not entirely consistent due to Crygonal becoming entry hazard-weak and still being saddled with limited coverage options, leaving it unable to hit everything it wants. Due to Cryogonal being a low-tier pick, it should never be considered as your primary Tera Captain. However, it has the potential to make for a good backup Tera Captain. Shedding its poor Ice typing can turn it into a sturdy special wall using its choice of defensive Tera types to attempt to wall whatever special attacker it likes. Standard defensive Tera types such as Tera Fairy and Water give Cryogonal actual resistances, while Tera types such as Tera Steel, Poison, and Electric come with the benefit of giving it no Ground weakness thanks to Levitate, making Cryogonal even more effective as a longevity-focused spinner. Finally, Tera types such as Tera Fire and Ground can be paired offensively with Cryogonal's Ice typing to give it some actual coverage against its counters, such as Steel- and Rock-types. Cryogonal is usually picked up at the end of the draft as a budget pick that provides entry hazard removal and speed control. Its limited offensive output and defensive fragility make it a flawed Pokemon on its own, and as such, it should be used solely to support its team through what limited but effective roles it brings to the table. Physical Walls: Since Cryogonal is KOed by almost any physical attack, it appreciates teammates with solid Defense stats to take hits for it. Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T make for great switch-ins to these attacks, allowing Cryogonal to last for longer. Steel- and Fire-type Checks: With its limited coverage, Cryogonal is completely helpless against Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon in particular, and as such, it appreciates teammates that can deal with them. Ground-types such as Great Tusk and Water-types such as Quaquaval and Greninja make for great offensive checks to these types of Pokemon. Entry Hazard-weak Teammates: By clearing the field of entry hazards, Cryogonal opens up more options for its teammates that would otherwise be pressured to run Heavy-Duty Boots to prevent them from being worn down. Pokemon that pivot frequently such as Meowscarada and Cinderace heavily appreciate this, while other hazard-weak Pokemon such as Gouging Fire can support themselves with better items and not be defensively compromised simply by hitting the field. Take note to not draft Cryogonal with the assumption that it can always clear the field, however, as it may have bad matchups that leave it unable to, and thus its teammates may opt to run Heavy-Duty Boots anyway. Setup Sweepers: When Cryogonal runs dual screens, it creates a dangerous environment that setup-sweeping teammates can take advantage of. Whether they are single-turn boosters such as Iron Boulder or attempting to obtain multiple boosts such as Annihilape and Galarian Moltres, the dual screens Cryogonal creates can mean a potential game over for the opponent. Physical Attacks: Cryogonal's Defense stat is painfully low, meaning it takes massive damage from just decently strong physical attacks, let alone powerful or super effective ones. Strong physical attackers such as Iron Hands, Urshifu-S, and Scizor can switch into Cryogonal's weak attacks and threaten it out, with the last two also packing U-turn to gain momentum against it. Ice-type Counters: Ice-types have many weaknesses, and due to Cryogonal lacking actual coverage options, foes of these types can naturally tank Cryogonal's attacks and threaten it with super effective damage. Metagross, Chi-Yu, and Heatran are a mere handful of the many Pokemon that can comfortably take on anything Cryogonal can do and force it out with super effective STAB attacks. Ghost-types: Ghost-types can block Rapid Spin and thus are excellent switch-ins to Cryogonal, especially if they have the typing or bulk to take Cryogonal's usually weak attacks. Ghost-type Pokemon such as Skeledirge, Annihilape, and the dreaded Gholdengo can easily switch into Cryogonal and force it out with their powerful attacks, leaving Cryogonal not having accomplished anything at all. Favorably-matched Entry Hazard Setters: Cryogonal's job is to remove entry hazards, but it unfortunately has a poor matchup against some common hazard setters, allowing them to come in on Cryogonal as it removes hazards, only for them to force it out and set the hazards back up, rendering Cryogonal's job pointless. Pokemon such as Iron Treads, Excadrill, and Glimmora have a favorable matchup against Cryogonal and can reliably set up hazards for their team as Cryogonal switches out. Specially Defensive Pokemon: Cryogonal's Special Attack is usable but not very strong, and it will rarely be investing in it. Combined with its limited coverage options and inability to set up, Pokemon with high Special Defense can attempt to switch into Cryogonal and threaten to KO it, status it, or simply force it out. Pokemon such as Iron Moth, Corviknight, and Jirachi have the bulk to repeatedly switch into Cryogonal and threaten it, even gaining momentum against it with U-turn."

  "Cyclizar": {
    "name": "Cyclizar",
    "text": "Cyclizar rides in as one of the defining Pokemon of the RU metagame. Its excellent Speed tier, access to Rapid Spin, and ability Regenerator make it the premier entry hazard removal option. It can also break out its utility toolbox, threatening to remove items from common switch-ins like Jirachi and Slowbro with Knock Off; phaze setup Pokemon like Suicune, Cresselia, and Yanmega with Dragon Tail; or pivot into a teammate like Crawdaunt or Entei with U-turn to keep up momentum. U-turn can allow setup sweepers like Armarouge and Reuniclus to freely switch in and start stacking up boosts. Cyclizar is often paired with other Regenerator Pokemon like Slowbro and Amoonguss to form Regenerator cores that can be difficult to break, especially when Cyclizar is removing entry hazards. It can further offer teams a bulky pivot when it straps on the Assault Vest, allowing it to take hits from special wallbreakers like Armarouge, Basculegion-F, and Volcanion. Cyclizar needs to be careful, however, of Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao that are looking to jam up Cyclizar's wheels and OHKO it with STAB Close Combat. Assault Vest Cyclizar can safely switch into most special attackers and provide opportunities for its teammates to enter the game thanks to U-turn. Rapid Spin clears entry hazards while also granting Cyclizar a boost to Speed, which helps it outspeed most Choice Scarf users in the tier like Gardevoir and Gengar. It also gives even a paralyzed Cyclizar the opportunity to pivot out of slower opponents like Empoleon and Hippowdon. Knock Off can hit the tier's Pyschic-types such as Reuniclus and Slowbro for decent damage while also threatening the frail Ghost-types like Gengar and Hisuian Zoroark. Draco Meteor can be used to hit physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro. Dragon Tail is great at forcing opposing setup sweepers like Cresselia and Slowbro out. Facade can take advantage of status like burn or paralysis that Cyclizar may be inflicted by throughout the course of a game from opposing Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Jirachi. Assault Vest helps with its otherwise low natural bulk, which is also helped significantly by Regenerator recovery. Timid maximum Speed Cyclizar is faster than the majority of the tier, and the bulk provided allows it to take two Ice Beams or Sludge Waves from threats such as Basculegion-F and Gengar, respectively. Tera Fairy flips Cyclizar's weakness to Dragon-type moves into an immunity and gives a resistance to Fighting-type moves, helping against opposing Cyclizar, Salamence, and Slither Wing. Tera Steel makes Cyclizar resistant to Fairy- and Ice-type moves from the likes of Gardevoir and Empoleon, respectively. Tera Ghost makes it immune to Normal-type, allowing it to stop Rapid Spin attempts from opposing Cyclizar, while adding an immunity to Fighting-type attacks as well. Assault Vest Cyclizar can reliably slot onto balance or bulky offense teams as the main form of entry hazard removal while also providing item removal and pivoting. It can also be used on stall teams, though these structures often want another hazard removal option such as Defog Talonflame to reliably maintain hazard control. Cyclizar pairs well with other Regenerator Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Mienshao, and Slowbro, creating teams that are very difficult to break offensively and can provide pressure through status, hazard chip, and gradual damage. Strong offensive teammates like Crawdaunt, Conkeldurr, and Volcanion appreciate Cyclizar giving them free entry points. While Cyclizar can often keep hazards off the field, it is advised to still run hazard-resilient or Heavy-Duty Boots teammates, such as Amoonguss, Hisuian Goodra, and Mienshao, since Cyclizar may struggle against teams with Ghost-types like Palossand or Mimikyu. Assault Vest Cyclizar can struggle to retain HP against hazard-stacking archetypes, being unable to remove hazards against teams utilizing Tera Ghost on their hazard setters. To mitigate this dynamic, Cyclizar relies on pivoting into teammates who can apply offensive pressure to deny hazards from being established, like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Volcanion. While usually overshadowed by the more prevalent Assault Vest set, running Heavy-Duty Boots on Cyclizar can offer meaningful benefits, allowing access to utility moves, while also making Regenerator more beneficial without needing to worry about the passive chip that comes with its usage as a spinner. Cyclizar is a master at providing utility for a team, boasting Knock Off to remove items from foes for other members of a team to take advantage of, with Heavy-Duty Boots users like Fezandipiti or Slowbro being great examples of Knock Off's usefulness over the course of a game. U-turn provides a way for Cyclizar to get out of sketchy matchups, being able to use the move safely against most of the tier with its phenomenal Speed stat. Taunt can shut down recovery or setup from foes that believe they can take advantage of the presumed passivity of Cyclizar, such as Hippowdon and Revavroom. Double-Edge can be slotted over Taunt if more damage is desired from Cyclizar, providing a harder-hitting STAB move than Rapid Spin, and its recoil is also somewhat negated with the HP gained back from Regenerator. Tera Ghost provides a last ditch-effort of escape against Fighting-types, one of Cyclizar's sketchier matchups, which is especially prevalent with the large amount of Fighting-type moves present in the tier, like Close Combat from various abusers including Slither Wing and Zapdos-Galar; however, Cyclizar is generally the last thing you want to Terastalize unless in truly dire straits, as Terastallization is usually far more effective and useful on other members of a team. Tera Ghost can also deny opposing spinners from removing entry hazards, keeping pressure on opposing teams throughout a game and additionally providing momentum through a wasted Rapid Spin. Heavy-Duty Boots Cyclizar fits on almost all team structures, with the main exception being hyper offense, as its role as a spinner with access to Regenerator makes it extremely reliable at removing entry hazards throughout the course of a game. To get the best use out of Cyclizar's utility, pairing it up with a Stealth Rock setter is extremely important, as Cyclizar's Knock Off makes opposing teams weaker to hazards; this can either be with allies like Hippowdon, or it can be run with Palossand on teams dedicated to hazard stacking. Additionally, pairing Cyclizar up with offensive options that can take advantage of the momentum that U-turn provides, with notable wallbreakers including Choice Band Terrakion and Volcanion being perfect teammates. Cyclizar is somewhat frail by itself, so pairing it up with defensive presences like the aforementioned physically defensive Stealth Rock setters, along with more specially defensive options like Empoleon, creates strong defensive cores that can be difficult to break and can wear down teams through a war of attrition. These defensive cores can be furthered with Regenerator cores, constantly keeping teammates healthy throughout a match, with notable teammates being Amoonguss, Slowbro, Mienshao, and Reuniclus. Pairing Cyclizar up with multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users is also wise, as it can have problems against dedicated spinblockers, with Palossand on hazard-stacking teams and Mimikyu on hyper offense builds. Body Slam is an option as Cyclizar's STAB move so it can fish for paralysis instead of doing more damage with Draco Meteor or Double-Edge. On teams that may have a hard time dealing with Gastrodon and Swampert, Cyclizar can run Power Whip to threaten a 2HKO on both of them. Overheat is an option for Cyclizars looking to supercharge its matchup against Forretress and Bisharp. Choice Scarf Users and Priority: Common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Krookodile and Terrakion can switch in and threaten to OHKO Cyclizar with Close Combat or take advantage of its need to switch out by using Knock Off or U-turn for free progress. Gardevoir is another common Choice Scarf user that can severely hamper Cyclizar's utility role with Trick. Bisharp can OHKO it at +2 with Sucker Punch, and Slither Wing threatens to KO with First Impression if Cyclizar has taken some chip. Ghost-types: Ghost-types block Rapid Spin and prevent Cyclizar from doing its most impartant job. Palossand isn't very threatened by Knock Off and can completely roadblock Cyclizar's efforts to remove hazards while setting its own up. Mimikyu is a Ghost-type that isn't weak to Knock Off and is immune to Draco Meteor, meaning it can set up Swords Dance for free while Cyclizar is forced to escape. Basculegion-F is a particular nuisance, as it can spinblock Cyclizar while also taking advantage of Knock Off with its Weakness Policy set. Tera Ghost on hazard setters such as Chesnaught, Empoleon, and Hippowdon can also put Cyclizar in a bind, denying it Rapid Spin removal. Setup Pokemon: Most setup Pokemon can take advantage of Cyclizar's relative weakness and lack of status to set up in front of it, as long as it isn't running Taunt or Dragon Tail. Bisharp, Revavroom, and Terrakion can take advantage of Cyclizar's passivity and set up in front of it."

  "Darkrai": {
    "name": "Darkrai",
    "text": "Darkrai is an excellent wallbreaker and cleaner, gaining many opportunities to use Nasty Plot due to its amazing base Speed and a diverse coverage movepool backed up with a good Special Attack stat and enough bulk to set up against passive Pokemon. Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Ground-type Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Roaring Moon, Gliscor, and Great Tusk that can take its Dark Pulse. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types like Clefable, Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Enamorus as well as Pokemon that commonly use Tera Fairy like Gholdengo, and Garganacl. Focus Blast tears through bulky Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit as well as Blissey. Psyshock can be used to hit Blissey and Clodsire; however, Clodsire can Terastallize to avoid being KOed if needed. Life Orb gives Darkrai a ton of power at the cost of longevity, granting it an OHKO on maximum HP Great Tusk with unboosted Ice Beam. Focus Sash turns Darkrai into an emergency check to Booster Energy Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and Roaring Moon if its Focus Sash is maintained. Tera Poison boosts Darkrai's Sludge Bomb and allows it to avoid revenge killing attempts from Iron Valiant and Zamazenta thanks to the Fairy- and Fighting-type resistances it gains. Tera Fighting can be used to power up Focus Blast to extreme levels of power to become Darkrai's strongest viable move, notably being able to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock, and combined with a Life Orb, it gives Darkrai a chance to outright OHKO Blissey at +2. Darkrai's wallbreaking capabilities are useful on offensively oriented teams, having strong synergies with other Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Kingambit and other special attackers like Raging Bolt and Dragapult. Roaring Moon and Kingambit pair with Darkrai to overwhelm or lure shared checks like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant while gaining opportunities to wallbreak by switching into each other's counters. Darkrai's Bad Dreams punishes Dondozo's Rest, further enhancing its synergy with Kingambit and Roaring Moon as well as other physical Pokemon like Zamazenta, as switching into Darkrai as Dondozo comes in to wall them will result in Bad Dreams chip without burning a sleep turn. Raging Bolt and Dragapult appreciate Darkrai's ability to break through balance teams, tearing through walls like Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking, while mixed Dragapult and Raging Bolt, especially with Taunt, can help break through Clodsire. Dragapult provides a stop to Zamazenta and punishes Kingambit with Will-O-Wisp if Darkrai isn't running Focus Blast. Darkrai appreciates support from entry hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Landorus-T, and Glimmora, as their hazards, especially Spikes, make Darkrai much more threatening, wearing down switch-ins like Zamazenta, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Darkrai heavily pressures hazard removers like Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Cinderace. Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T in particular have deeper synergy with Darkrai; Hisuian Samurott wears down Primarina, switches into Darkrai checks like Blissey and Clodsire to set up Spikes on forced switches, and can use Flip Turn to safely bring in Darkrai on physically defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Dondozo, and Alomomola to gain free turns. Landorus-T is an excellent physical blanket check and can switch into threatening Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Booster Energy Great Tusk that can threaten Darkrai, and it can use U-turn to bring in Darkrai safely on Pokemon like Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T. Gholdengo is an excellent teammate due to it providing a check to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Enamorus while being able to counter most Zamazenta variants if running a physically defensive set. Rillaboom can threaten answers to Darkrai like Primarina, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire while being able to pivot Darkrai in on Pokemon like defensive Gholdengo, Skarmory, and Corviknight to keep up momentum. Assault Vest Primarina is an excellent partner that blanket checks many special attackers including Iron Valiant and Deoxys-S, pivots Darkrai in on its checks like Galarian Slowking, and pressures shared walls such as Blissey and Terastallized Clodsire for Darkrai to break through. Darkrai, owing to its already impressive Speed stat, is among one of the tier's most consistent revenge killers and an outstanding piece of speed control. Outspeeding the entirety of OU's metagame, Choice Scarf Darkrai reliably threatens Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and Enamorus. It can also threaten other, more specially bulky Pokemon with prior chip damage. Sludge Bomb is mandatory to threaten Fairy-types like Enamorus and Iron Valiant. Focus Blast is used to smash Steel-types and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Ice Beam effectively forces out many common Ground-types like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, which otherwise could easily set up entry hazards against it. Trick can be used over the previous two moves, as it allows Darkrai to incapacitate a sweeper, like Dragonite, or a wall, like Clodsire, long-term and grants it the flexibility of being able to switch moves. Tera Poison is used to strengthen Sludge Bomb's damage output, allowing it to threaten the bulkier Clefable while also coming with the added benefit of resisting the many Fairy-types' Moonblast, Zamazenta's STAB moves, and letting survive Rillaboom's Grassy Glide in a pinch. Tera Dark is a solid offensive option, turning many 3HKOs like against Walking Wake into 2HKOs. Additionally, late-game, a boosted Dark Pulse can easily clean up a weakened team. Tera Fighting can also be used with Focus Blast, giving the move incredible power that allows Darkrai to OHKO Roaring Moon and Heatran, and it can 2HKO the mighty Ting-Lu. Darkrai fits best on offensive teams that necessitate its revenge killing talents. It’s important to note that Darkrai actually has issues revenge killing as a result of Terastallization, with many usually clean revenge kills being complicated by this mechanic. This issue is only compounded by the fact that all of Darkrai’s moves all have common switch-ins, so it’s very important to have other answers to the Pokemon Darkrai aims to revenge kill. As a result, Primarina is a solid partner, with its typing and firepower being able to check switch-ins to Dark Pulse like Iron Valiant, Enamrous, and Heatran, safely scout for potential Terastallizations against them, and provide momentum with Flip Turn. Landorus-T is similarly a good partner, with its ability to check physical attackers that Darkrai can't safely revenge kill in the event of Terastallization, such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Great Tusk; it also provides momentum with U-turn and helps put Darkrai's victims into range of its attacks with Stealth Rock. Additionally, it can disrupt many of Darkrai switch-ins with Taunt, like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Blissey. On the topic of entry hazards, Great Tusk and Cinderace are also good partners, as they provide hazard control that is seriously appreciated by Darkrai, which otherwise will get chipped down as it switches in and out of the field to apply pressure. Great Tusk checks many priority users that would otherwise deny Darkrai its ability to revenge kill, such as Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. It also can pressure Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, denying their hazards and threatening them with significant damage that prevents them from switching into Darkrai. Cinderace is effective as a result of its ability to remove entry hazards Court Change and spread burns to Pokemon that could otherwise outpace Darkrai, such as Rillaboom and Dragonite, while its U-turn dents Hisuian Samurott. Dragapult is also a great partner due to its anti-offensive nature, with its speedy Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave allowing it to be Darkrai's fallback line in the event of an unexpected Tera. It handles many switch-ins like Rillaboom, the Ogerpon formes, and Zamazenta by debilitating them with status and providing pivoting with U-turn. Dragapult can also deconstruct stall, which Darkrai matches up poorly into. Kingambit also loves Darkrai's ability to outpace Iron Valiant, as Darkrai opens up Kingambit late-game by KOing or at least forcing chip damage on key targets, putting them in range of Sucker Punch. Furthermore, Darkrai can also cripple physical walls like Dondozo and Skarmory with Trick, while Darkrai enjoys Kingambit's Sucker Punch putting targets in range of its attacks and Iron Head eliminating Clefable and Primarina. Raging Bolt is an effective partner, as Darkrai's ability to use Trick and shut down special walls like Blissey, Skeledirge, and Clodsire is great for opening it up against bulkier teams. Darkrai's coverage in Focus Blast can help simplify Raging Bolt's endgame, as it pressures Ting-Lu, Roaring Moon and Kingambit, notably simplifying the mindgames between it and Kingambit, while Ice Beam can also help eliminate Ground-types like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor for it to use Thunderclap late-game. Leveraging its high Speed, impressive power, and access to a wide range of coverage moves, Darkrai is able to thrive in OU as a powerful wallbreaker and disruption tool. Sludge Bomb complements Darkrai's STAB Dark Pulse by targeting Fairy-types like Clefable, Primarina, and Hatterene while also giving Darkrai powerful coverage into Ogerpon-W. Focus Blast enhances Darkrai's coverage further by targeting bulky Dark-types like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon, and Ice Beam lets Darkrai OHKO Gliscor and Landorus-T while being its strongest option against Great Tusk, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. Darkrai's deep movepool can be explored to further customize its role on a team by trading out some of its coverage for utility. Knock Off can provide fantastic support by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from switch-ins like Clodsire and Blissey, while it is possible to delve deeper into Darkrai's utility movepool to give it even more potent options against defensive switch-ins, such as Will-O-Wisp to permanently neuter physical attackers and Taunt to shut down both recovery moves and status effects from Blissey and Clodsire. Finally, Sucker Punch is a niche option that is able to pick off weakened foes like Dragapult and Deoxys-S that would otherwise be able to revenge kill it; when using Sucker Punch, a spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature is optimal to minimize damage from common priority moves like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, though a Hasty nature can be useful to take on Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Life Orb is a fantastic option that bolsters Darkrai's power even further, giving it a clean 2HKO on Corviknight after Stealth Rock along with OHKOs on max HP Great Tusk with Ice Beam and Ogerpon-W with Sludge Bomb after any entry hazard chip; with Life Orb, 29 HP IVs can be used to minimize recoil. Alternatively, Expert Belt takes advantage of Darkrai's excellent coverage without sacrificing its longevity, maintaining OHKOs on offensive Gholdengo and Enamorus; Heavy-Duty Boots improves Darkrai's longevity further, but the loss in power not only sacrifices the aforementioned benchmarks, it also leaves Darkrai unable to safely 2HKO Galarian Slowking. Tera Poison is a fantastic option both offensively and defensively on Darkrai. With Life Orb or Expert Belt, Tera Poison Sludge Bomb is able to OHKO Clefable, Hatterene, and Alolan Ninetales and 2HKO Assault Vest Primarina, and even without a boosting item, it can OHKO both Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom. In turn, Tera Poison flips Darkrai's Fighting- and Fairy-type weaknesses into resistances, allowing it to take hits from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Enamorus if necessary, as well as granting it a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Tera Fighting can instead be considered to increase the power of Darkrai's Focus Blast to monstrous levels at the expense of not granting much defensive value; Tera-boosted Focus Blast allows Expert Belt Darkrai to 2HKO even Ting-Lu, and grants Life Orb Darkrai a roll in its favor to 2HKO Blissey. Darkrai provides a huge amount of value to offense teams that appreciate its high Speed along with its ability to threaten Galarian Slowking, though even slower, more balanced teams can still find value in its ability to threaten a significant proportion of the tier and force switches to take advantage of entry hazards. Landorus-T is a strong partner that can not only set Stealth Rock but is also able to switch in on threats to Darkrai like Zamazenta and help to offset Darkrai's relative frailty by bringing it in safely with U-turn. Similarly, Gliscor makes a good pairing on bulkier structures with its ability to come in on both Zamazenta and Clodsire. As Darkrai typically makes its home on more offensive builds, partners that can handle Darkrai's checks without being momentum sinks are much appreciated; Assault Vest Primarina forms a great core with Darkrai, able to switch in on Iron Valiant and Enamorus and force them out. Primarina also appreciates Darkrai threatening Galarian Slowking. Offensively, special attackers like Iron Valiant and Raging Bolt that can help to overload shared checks like Clodsire and Blissey make great partners. Darkrai doesn't only work with special overload, though; Dark-type spam teams benefit greatly from Darkrai pressuring and being able to deal heavy damage to threats like Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Primarina, allowing for threats like Roaring Moon and Weavile to later break through. In return, Roaring Moon, Weavile, and other Dark-type attackers like Kingambit are able to weaken Zamazenta for Darkrai while also being able to take advantage of Darkrai's more passive switch-ins like Clodsire and Blissey; Ogerpon-W is another powerful partner that can force damage onto Zamazenta and turn passive walls into setup fodder. Hisuian Samurott is another partner that benefits from this support in overloading shared checks while also setting up Spikes, which Darkrai appreciates greatly. Particularly when opting not to run Heavy-Duty Boots, Darkrai appreciates hazard removal to give it more turns on the field; Great Tusk is a natural pick that is also able to pressure Zamazenta and can invite in Iron Valiant to burn its Booster Energy. Another partner that can help Darkrai both defensively and offensively is Gholdengo, as Gholdengo can switch in on Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Clefable while Gholdengo in turn appreciates Darkrai's ability to weaken or eliminate opposing Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott. Bulkier teams can opt to pair Galarian Slowking with Darkrai with its ability to pivot around Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and the Future Sight support it provides turns Darkrai into a devastating threat that Clodsire cannot switch into and Zamazenta cannot safely force out."

  "Decidueye": {
    "name": "Decidueye",
    "text": "Thanks to a great STAB combination that only a few Pokemon resist, a great boosting move in Swords Dance, a useful ability in Long Reach, and a good defensive typing, Decidueye is one of PU's strongest physical wallbreakers and sweepers. While Spirit Shackle is generally preferred for its increased accuracy, Poltergeist can be opted instead for its higher power, allowing Decidueye to OHKO Bellibolt with Tera Ghost after a Swords Dance, although its anti-synergy with Knock Off can make it unappealing. Leaf Blade targets Pokemon such as Mudsdale and Milotic, but if these aren't issues, then Low Kick can allow Decidueye to not be walled by Coalossal while also dealing with Alolan Sandslash and Copperajah. Shadow Sneak is useful priority to pick off faster weakened threats like Salazzle and Delphox. Knock Off can be used to give Decidueye extra utility and punish common switch-ins like Staraptor and Wo-Chien, but it is very hard to justify using it over other moves, and it does not work well with Poltergeist. Spell Tag lets Decidueye OHKO Toxtricity with unboosted Poltergeist and Tatsugiri with +2 Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock. Decidueye's choice of Tera type is flexible; Tera Ghost boosts the power of its Ghost-type STAB moves and gives Decidueye a better defensive typing, allowing it to spinblock Alolan Sandslash and set up on Pokemon like Delphox and Salazzle, while Tera Fairy allows Decidueye to take on Dark-type Pokemon like Zoroark and Scrafty. Decidueye excels on offensive or balance teams looking for a strong wallbreaker with sweeping and cleaning potential. Faster Normal-types like Staraptor, Meloetta, and Ambipom cannot be swept by Shadow Sneak and can threaten Decidueye in return, so checks to these Pokemon like Bellibolt and Gligar make good partners. Decidueye is also relatively frail, so slow pivots like Bellibolt, Gligar, and Milotic can help bring it in safely. Florges, Mudsdale, Paldean Tauros-W, and Skuntank can help switch into Decidueye's checks like opposing Skuntank, Bombirdier, Scrafty, and Galarian Articuno. Decidueye can struggle against offensive Fire-types like Arcanine and Paldean Tauros-F, so Pokemon like Mudsdale and Milotic make excellent partners. Decidueye's ability to beat common physical walls like Mudsdale, Galarian Slowbro, and Bellibolt make other physical sweepers like Arcanine, Ambipom, and Paldean Tauros-W valuable teammates. In turn, these three can take out Decidueye's offensive checks, like Staraptor and Zoroark, with priority to complement Decidueye's Shadow Sneak. Although facing slight competition from Golurk, Decidueye's great STAB combo, ability to pivot thanks to U-turn, great ability in Long Reach, and good Attack stat make it a great all-out attacker in PU. Spirit Shackle is generally preferred for its better accuracy and lack of conflict with Knock Off, although Poltergeist is an option if the extra power is preferred, allowing Decidueye to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro with a boosting item and Stealth Rock chip damage. Shadow Sneak is valuable priority, allowing Decidueye to pick off faster threats and setup sweepers such as Salazzle, Delphox, and Flamigo. U-turn allows Decidueye to operate as a pivot, allowing it to safely escape unfavorable matchups such as Bellibolt, Bombirdier, Coalossal, and Wo-Chien. Leaf Blade is a secondary STAB move that targets Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Mudsdale, but if these aren't an issue, Low Kick allows Decidueye to hit Steel-types such as Copperajah and Alolan Sandslash as well as Coalossal. On Heavy-Duty Boots variants, Sucker Punch is a viable option that targets faster Normal-types like Meloetta and Staraptor and hits Ghost-types harder than Shadow Sneak; however, Shadow Sneak normally provides more value. Choice Band grants Decidueye incredibly high power, allowing it to 2HKO even Skuntank and Bombirdier after minor chip damage and more easily push past Pokemon like Bellibolt, Duraludon, and Coalossal. Spell Tag only boosts Decidueye's Ghost-type STAB moves but lets it switch attacks, which makes it less prediction reliant. Heavy-Duty Boots is an alternative to not take entry hazard damage, which is especially useful with U-turn. Just like Spell Tag, Tera Ghost boosts Decidueye's Ghost-type STAB moves, allowing it to achieve rolls such as 2HKOing Florges with Spirit Shackle, potentially OHKOing Delphox with Spell Tag-boosted Shadow Sneak, and 2HKOing Bellibolt with Spell Tag-boosted Poltergeist. Alternatively, Tera Fairy is a purely defensive Tera type that allows Decidueye to live Dark-type attacks like Sucker Punch and Knock Off from Pokemon like Skuntank, Scrafty, and Emboar and threaten them back. Decidueye finds itself on offensive and bulky offensive teams that appreciate its unique ability to function as a wallbreaker, spinblocker, and pivot all in one. Even with Low Kick and U-turn, Decidueye can struggle against Dark-types such as Skuntank, Bombirdier, and Wo-Chien that it can't reliably beat, so Pokemon that can check these threats such as Mudsdale, Florges, and Flamigo all make excellent partners. Other pivots such as Bellibolt, Milotic, and Gligar make a great pivot core with Decidueye and can be fallbacks for it against Pokemon such as Coalossal, Bombirdier, and Scyther. If Decidueye opts to not run Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard control from Pokemon like Altaria, Coalossal, and Alolan Sandslash allows Decidueye to be a better pivot and wallbreaker. In turn, Decidueye beats their checks such as Gastrodon and Bronzong. Decidueye's ability to pressure common defensive cores such as Galarian Slowbro and Wo-Chien as well as Gastrodon and Bellibolt allows teammates like Arcanine and Toxtricity to set up and sweep. Decidueye's Ghost typing allows it to be a failsafe against Pokemon like Arcanine and Quick Attack Scyther, making it a decent teammate for the likes of Wo-Chien and Paldean Tauros-F. Likewise, if it's running Spirit Shackle, Decidueye can trap and revenge kill Pokemon like Scyther and Florges, enabling teammates like Zoroark and Goodra."

  "Decidueye-Hisui": {
    "name": "Decidueye-Hisui",
    "text": "Hisuian Decidueye's unique bag of tricks, including its powerful Triple Arrows, rare utility in Defog, Swords Dance, U-turn, and Sucker Punch gives it a unique place as either a fearsome setup sweeper that tears through defensive teams or a defensive Defog-packing pivot that removes entry hazards in the face of the most common setters like Orthworm and Sandaconda. Its typing makes defensive sets adept at checking many threats like Brute Bonnet, Floatzel, and Lycanroc. However, Hisuian Decidueye's low speed makes it difficult for it to face up against offensive teams, as many revenge killers like Passimian and Virizion can easily take it out without fearing offensive sets's priority attacks. Hisuian Decidueye has trouble fitting every move it wants, especially on offensive sets, often leaving it walled by common foes like Charizard and Qwilfish. Lastly, Hisuian Decidueye faces competition from other Grass-types like Whimsicott and other Fighting-types like Passimian; it especially faces competition from Virizion, which shares its typing. With its great matchups into many of the tier's hazard setters like Sandaconda and Orthworm, Hisuian Decidueye is an excellent user of the rare Defog while also serving as a good check to several offensive threats like Floatzel, Brute Bonnet, and Rhydon. Roost provides Hisuian Decidueye with reliable recovery. U-turn lets Hisuian Decidueye grab momentum against the switches it forces against Pokemon like Dudunsparce and Regirock. Knock Off removes items from otherwise-safe switch-ins like Charizard and Cramorant. Scrappy lets Triple Arrows nail Ghost-types like Spiritomb and Sableye and also blocks Intimidate from both Qwilfish. Tera Steel improves Hisuian Decidueye's matchup into hazard setters like Froslass and Qwilfish as well as threats like Whimsicott, Mesprit, and Sneasel. Hisuian Decidueye is immensely helpful for balance teams to remove hazards that would otherwise pressure them greatly. Defensive walls that struggle with hazards, such as Regirock and Porygon-2, love Hisuian Decidueye removing hazards to make them far harder to be taken down. Regirock in particular is an excellent partner in crime, with it stonewalling the Fire- and Flying-types like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Oricorio-G that greatly threaten Hisuian Decidueye while Hisuian Decidueye handles the Grass-, Ground-, and Water-types that Regirock struggles to handle, notably Virizion, Pallosand, and Floatzel. Snorlax also helps cover Fire-types for Hisuian Decidueye while appreciating the removal of entry hazards as well as Hisiuan Decidueye's positive matchup into counters like Orthworm and Regirock. Typhlosion is another notable teammate that enjoys Hisuian Decidueye's hazard removal and slow pivoting as well as its capability to deal with Rock- and Water-types like Rhydon and Lanturn that check Typhlosion. Psychic-types like Mesprit and Farigiraf can use Hisuian Decidueye as setup fodder, so teammates that deal with them like Hisuian Qwilfish and Magneton are useful teammates for Hisuian Decidueye. Weezing and Qwilfish can easily enter on Hisuian Decidueye and spread status or reestablish hazards, annoying it greatly, so teammates like Magneton and Mesprit are helpful in scaring them back. Whimsicott is a notable threat that can liberally switch into Hisuian Decidueye and start firing off attacks, so special walls that deal with it like Articuno and Dudunsparce help immensely. Hisuian Sneasel can take advantage of Hisuian Decidueye to start setting up, so teammates that can deal with it such as Pallosand and Weezing, are useful partners. Other pivots such as Grafaiai, Floatzel, and Jolteon, can form a powerful VoltTurn core with Hisuian Decidueye and appreciate it removing hazards to allow them to come in more times over the course of a game. Hisuian Decidueye can take advantage of the many switches it forces to set up Swords Dance. Triple Arrows is the prefered Fighting-type STAB option for its lack of drawback and capability to brute force past foes with its myriad secondary effects. Leaf Blade threatens Ground-types like Sandaconda and Palossand. Knock Off annoys common switch-ins like Charizard and Rotom and allows Hisuian Decidueye to force progress before it's primed to sweep. Sucker Punch picks off faster Pokemon like Mespirit and Oricorio-G. Shadow Sneak hits some foes that resist Sucker Punch like Passimian, Hisuian Sneasel, and Hitmonlee. slightly harder but is generally not worth the loss of power against neutral targets. On certain teams like Sticky Webs offense, Hisuian Decidueye may opt to drop priority. Lum Berry lets Hisuian Decidueye shrug off status conditions like Will-O-Wisp from Weezing and Charizard once. Tera Dark boosts the power of Sucker Punch and Knock Off while giving Hisuian Decidueye a Psychic immunity, improving its matchup against Mesprit. Scrappy lets Hisuian Decidueye hit Ghost-types like Froslass, Spiritomb, and Sableye with Triple Arrows, with the added benefit of blocking Intimidate from Qwilfish and Hisuian Qwilfish. Hisuian Decidueye's unique capability to tear defensive Pokemon apart makes it a great pick on many teams ranging from semistall to hyper offense. Fellow Fighting-types like Passimian and Hisuian Sneasel enjoy teaming up with Hisuian Decidueye, overwhelming the few Fighting-type checks like Weezing and Charizard. Special attacking teammates like Mesprit and Whimsicott enjoy Hisuian Decidueye pressuring their checks like Snorlax, Dudunsparce, and Orthworm, and in return, they threaten physical walls like Qwilfish and Dipplin, respectively. Switch-ins to Fire-types like Lanturn and Regirock help Hisuian Decidueye deal with the likes of Charizard and Typhlosion. As Hisuian Decidueye can't touch Weezing, Pokemon that can deal with it such as Mesprit, Farigiraf and Magneton are great teammates. Entry hazard setters like Froslass, Qwilfish, and Orthworm greatly help Hisuian Decidueye sweep, especially if it's running Knock Off to remove Heavy-duty Boots. Whimsicott is a notable threat that easily switches into Hisuian Decidueye and threatens it back; as such, defensive answers to it like Charizard and Articuno are great partners. Dipplin can take Hisuian Decidueye's attacks and phaze it with Dragon Tail, so teammates that can scare it out like Whimsicott and Charizard make for great teammates. Pivots like Articuno, Jolteon and Grafaiai help bring Hisuian Decidueye in on foes like Orthworm and Dudunsparce, giving it setup opportunities. Brave Bird seems tempting to nail Whimsicott on the switch-in but is quite bad otherwise and hard to fit. Scope Lens is a potential option on Swords Dance sets, letting Hisuian Decidueye have near-guarenteed critical hits on Triple Arrows and Leaf Blade, but this lacks the utility of Lum Berry. Defensive sets can invest varying degrees of speed to outpace threats like Glastrier, Orthworm, and Sandaconda. Poison-types: Weezing is a near-perfect wall to Hisuian Decidueye, taking minimal damage from its attacks and threatening it in return with super effective attacks or status conditions. Grafaiai threatens Hisuian Decidueye with Gunk Shot, or it can use encore to lock Hisuian Decidueye into an unfavorable move and force it to switch out, potentially gaining momentum with U-turn. Qwilfish greatly annoys defensive sets, easily setting up entry hazards on it, but must be wary of Swords Dance, since Intimidate is blocked by Scrappy, and a +2 Leaf Blade deals huge damage. Hisuian Qwilfish is unthreathened by Sucker Punch and can take Hisuian Decidueye out with a Poison-type attack, but it doesn't take Triple Arrows very well and hates having its Eviolte removed by Knock Off. Flying-types: Hisuian Decidueye's 4x weakness to Flying makes it incredibly threatened by the likes of Dodrio, Oricorio-G, Oricorio-F, and Braviary, which can use it as an opportunity to set up. Cramorant is a shakier switch-in but can assist its team in pivoting around Triple Arrows. However, these Pokemon must think twice about switching in directly in fear of Knock Off or Triple Arrows. Fire-types: Fire-types like Charizard and Pyroar put immense pressure on Hisuian Decidueye with their super effective STAB attacks. Will-O-Wisp lets them dance around Sucker Punch, reducing the effectiveness of Hisuian Decidueye's sweeping potential. Typhlosion doesn't enjoy Sucker Punch but likewise scares Hisuian Decidueye out. Knock Off ruins these Pokemon, however, making them wary of switching in. Psychic-types: Mesprit offensively threatens Hisuian Decidueye with Psychic-type STAB moves, sets up Stealth Rock, can use Encore to lock it into a status move. Nasty Plot sets can set up a Substitute on Swords Dance Hisuian Decidueye's Sucker Punch, but Mesprit has to be wary of Knock Off, Shadow Sneak, and even U-turn from defensive sets. Farigiraf's Armor Tail and Indeedee-Fs Psychic Terrain block Sucker Punch completely, allowing them to fire at Decidueye unhindered. Knock Off does remove their items and greatly damages them, however, and U-turn also deals good damage while potentially putting them into precarious positions. Ice-types: Sneasel and Frosmoth outpace Hisuian Decidueye and can destroy it with super effective attacks. They can also play around Sucker Punch with Ice Shard and Substitute, respectively. Glastrier has the bulk to take a Triple Arrows from Hisuian Decidueye and hit back with Icicle Crash. All of them are unable to switch in directly, however. Faster Attackers: Several faster revenge killers like Whimsicott, Passimian, and Virizion outspeed Hisuian Decidueye and resist Sucker Punch, letting them retaliate with their own powerful attacks. Other faster special attackers like Jolteon and Magneton outspeed and threaten Hisuian Decidueye. Status Conditions: Will-o-Wisp from Weezing and Charizard takes Hisuian Decidueye out of commision, severely weakening its attacks. Toxic from Qwilfish and Hisuian Qwilfish eats away at Hisuian Decidueye's HP and stops potential sweeps in their tracks. Lum Berry on Swords Dance sets can alleviate this problem once a game, but defensive sets can't afford to use this item."

    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! When one looks at Deoxys-A, the first thing that stands out is its astronomical attacking stats. Its incredible base 150 Speed is also extremely relevant, as it leaves already fast Pokemon like Zacian-C, Koraidon, and Miraidon in the dust. This, in conjunction with its deep movepool, makes Deoxys-A a fearsome wallbreaker and revenge killer capable of threatening everything in the game for at least neutral damage. However, another notable aspect of Deoxys-A’s stats is its pitiful bulk that leaves it OHKOed by every attack in the game, giving it very limited opportunities to safely switch in and actually use its power, as well as leaving it prone to revenge killing from Choice Scarf users like Koraidon and Miraidon and priority from Pokemon like Extreme Killer Arceus. It also has trouble OHKOing some targets like Ting-Lu and Necrozma-DM despite its tremendous power because of a lack of either investment or STAB on its coverage. It is also significantly less threatening after it uses Psycho Boost, letting Pokemon like Miraidon and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM use it as setup fodder. Despite that, Deoxys-A is a high-reward Pokemon that is worth its high risk if played properly. This set aims to get as much leverage out of Deoxys-A's limited switch-in opportunities as possible. Psycho Boost severely damages almost everything that doesn't resist it, with even defensive Ho-Oh being 2HKOed. Shadow Ball and Low Kick are mainly used to hit Pokemon that resist Psycho Boost. Shadow Ball hits enemy Psychic-types like Necrozma-DM and Calyrex-I super effectively, while Low Kick hits Zacian-C, Ting-Lu, and Kingambit on the switch. Rock Slide targets Ho-Oh, having a chance to OHKO it from full HP. Tera Ghost not only avoids revenge killing attempts from Extreme Killer Arceus but also turns Shadow Ball into a powerful attack that can serve as a strong, spammable STAB move, even OHKOing offensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM after minimal chip damage and doing impressive damage to defensive Necrozma-DM. Since Deoxys-A is so frail, it requires support from pivots to get on the field safely. Therefore, Choice Scarf Koraidon and pivot Miraidon are excellent partners, as they provide reliable pivoting in the form of U-turn while being offensively threatening in their own right. They also love Deoxys-A threatening their checks. Choice Scarf Koraidon has trouble getting past physically defensive Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water, which Deoxys-A can break with Koraidon's U-turn support. Miraidon and Deoxys-A have common checks in healthy Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground, so Deoxys-A pairing with Miraidon means one can work to overwhelm these checks for the other to go berserk. Entry hazard support from Gliscor and Ting-Lu is also appreciated, as it cuts down on the prediction Deoxys-A needs to actually break bulky Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Ting-Lu. Checks to Extreme Killer Arceus and Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon are also recommended, such as Zacian-C, Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Fairy. Thanks to its incredibly high Special Attack and Speed, Deoxys-A is an strong alternative to Deoxys-S and Glimmora as an entry hazard setter. Shadow Ball does considerable damage to opposing Deoxys-S and Necrozma-DM. Icy Wind limits Deoxys-S to one layer of hazards while giving teammates like Miraidon and Koraidon easier entry into opposing lead Miraidon, Arceus formes, and Zacian-C. Psycho Boost is Deoxys-A’s main damage option and prevents Glimmora from getting up multiple layers of entry hazards. Taunt is another option that prevents Ribombee from setting up Sticky Web, but this is not preferred, since Ribombee often runs Pounce anyways. Stealth Rock is an option as well to let Deoxys-A set up dual hazards, but Deoxys-A’s lack of longevity and bulk means it is often limited to a single layer. Tera Ghost is the primary Tera type for giving Deoxys-A an immunity to Extreme Speed, letting it 2HKO Necrozma-DM, and for blocking Rapid Spin from Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Terapagos. Tera Steel is also an option for blocking Glimmora's Mortal Spin. Deoxys-A primarily fits on hyper offense for its ability to set up entry hazards and generate momentum for its teammates. Partners like Zacian-C, Miraidon, Necrozma-DM, and Koraidon appreciate Deoxys-A setting up hazards and chipping their checks, such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Fairy. However, since Deoxys-A doesn't run Taunt often, opposing Ting-Lu leads can be difficult to deal with. Partners like Zacian-C, Koraidon, Kyurem-B, and Calyrex-I help overwhelm Ting-Lu. Furthermore, opposing Extreme Speed users such as Deoxys-S, Arceus, and Rayquaza can limit Deoxys-A to a single hazard. Teammates such as defensive Calm Mind Arceus-Ground can help take these on and provide more defensive utility to the hyper offense teams that Deoxy-A fits in. Opposing Giratina-O can anti-lead Deoxys-A and threaten teammates such as Necrozma-DM, Tera Ghost Koraidon, and Calyrex-I, so partners like Chien-Pao, Miraidon and Kyurem-B that can threaten it out are appreciated. Superpower is an option on lead Deoxys-A for wearing down Ting-Lu for teammates such as Arceus-Ground, Miraidon, and Necrozma-DM. Psychic can be used over Psycho Boost to not risk a miss against Glimmora and Koraidon, but the power of Psycho Boost is useful against Arceus formes. Thunder Wave can be used to cripple opposing defensive Arceus formes and Zacian-C. On mixed attacker sets, Nasty Plot is a high-risk option that takes advantage of Deoxys-A’s ability to force switches. This usually pairs well with Focus Blast to threaten an OHKO on Ting-Lu. Revenge Killers: While Deoxys-A is very fast, it is still outsped by some Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon. Flutter Mane also outspeeds Deoxys-A in sun. These Pokemon cannot switch into Deoxys-A, but they can reliably threaten to revenge kill it. Priority: Deoxys-A's awful bulk leaves it prone to all forms of priority, such as Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus and Rayquaza, Shadow Sneak from Giratina-O, Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit, and Ice Shard from Chien-Pao. Tera Ghost can mitigate the weakness to Extreme Speed, but Deoxys-A cannot threaten Arceus if it is at full HP. Psychic-resistant Pokemon: While Deoxys-A is indeed impossible to safely switch into, it is not so strong that it doesn't have any issues with power. Pokemon that resist Psycho Boost, like Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Ting-Lu, can come into it after a KO and check it, as Deoxys-A cannot OHKO these Pokemon. Necrozma-DM in particular is troublesome for Deoxys-A, as it can use Deoxys-A as setup fodder after taking Psycho Boost."

  "Deoxys-Speed": {
    "name": "Deoxys-Speed",
    "text": "Thanks to its monstrous Speed, decent attacking stats, and amazing coverage, Deoxys-S can function as a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner. It outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in OU and outspeeds plenty of boosted Pokemon as well, such as +1 Great Tusk and +1 Dragonite. Fighting-type coverage is required to hit Dark- and Steel-types that switch into Psycho Boost, like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Superpower can be run to hit special walls like Blissey, but Focus Blast doesn't have any stat drops and also benefits from boosts from Nasty Plot. Knock Off removes items, helping it break down walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Shadow Ball can be used instead if it's running Nasty Plot and to avoid being walled by Hatterene. In its last move slot, it can run Ice Beam for even greater coverage, letting it destroy Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. However, Psycho Boost hits the latter two hard anyway, so Nasty Plot can be ran instead to drastically increase its killing power if it’s running only special moves. For example, +2 Psycho Boost can OHKO Primarina without Assault Vest, +2 Focus Blast can OHKO specially defensive Heatran, and +2 Shadow Ball can OHKO Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Gholdengo. Finally, Taunt can be used as utility, denying hazards, setup, and keeping Deoxys-S free from status like Gliscor's Toxic and Clefable's Thunder Wave, and also stopping Galarian Slowking from gaining momentum with Chilly Reception. Other moves Deoxys-S can run include Expanding Force over Psycho Boost if it's used with Psychic Terrain and Stealth Rock or Spikes in its last slot to take advantage of switches. A Timid nature should be ran if using Nasty Plot, but a Naive nature should be used if running a mixed set. A Hasty nature is an alternative to better take special moves like Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, but it makes Deoxys-S weaker into common priority like Extreme Speed and Grassy Glide. Tera Fighting is its premier Tera type, giving it STAB on its Fighting-type coverage, letting it hit Psycho Boost switch-ins harder. It guarantees that Superpower will 2HKO Heatran and Iron Treads and lets +2 Focus Blast OHKO Ting-Lu. It also has defensive utility, like giving it a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tera Ghost can be useful on Shadow Ball sets to break past its Psychic-type switch-ins, letting it get a 2HKO on Galarian Slowking and Latias. It also gives Deoxys-S an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Finally, Tera Psychic further boosts its Psycho Boosts, which lets it guarantee an OHKO into Walking Wake and Ogerpon-W. Life Orb boosts its damage output, but Expert Belt can be used instead to avoid recoil damage. However, missing out on Life Orb can cost Deoxys-S some KOs like missing a 2HKO on Clefable with Psycho Boost and losing the ability to do substantial damage to Corviknight. Deoxys-S is best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Offensive teammates such as Roaring Moon and Darkrai like the holes Deoxys-S pokes into opposing teams. It can damage walls like Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Galarian Slowking for these teammates or check other offensive Pokemon that outspeed them like Zamazenta and Dragapult. Its Fighting-type coverage takes care of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran, removing checks for other teammates like its own Kingambit and Dragapult. Similarly, its Ghost- or Dark-type coverage lets it take out Hatterene and Gholdengo, opening up opportunities for teammates like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder to clean up late-game. Thanks to its perfect coverage, it is able to deal decent damage to any opponent, further opening holes for its teammates. This includes Pokemon like Dondozo, Roaring Moon, and Corviknight. Offensive teammates also appreciate its fast Knock Off removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard support from teammates like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora help with breaking as well. Similarly, if it runs Taunt, teammates such as Iron Moth like its fast Taunt denying hazards, stopping setup from opponents, and limiting recovery. While Deoxys-S has great coverage, its base 95 attacking stats are relatively low, and Psycho Boost lowering its Special Attack is less than ideal. As such, it can struggle to break past certain walls it can't hit super effectively like Corviknight and Assault Vest Primarina. Raging Bolt can freely switch into Corviknight and set up free Calm Minds as it switches out. Despite its massive natural Speed stat, Deoxys-S is still outsped by a lot of prominent boosted Pokemon like +1 Roaring Moon, +1 Iron Boulder, +1 Walking Wake, and Barraskewda in rain. These can be covered by carrying offensive checks to these mons like Kingambit, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Ogerpon-W. Deoxys-S is also horribly weak to priority. It doesn't have many ways to work around Sucker Punch, and other priority like Grassy Glide and Extreme Speed hit it hard. A way around this is having teammates that can easily take common priority like Kingambit, Great Tusk, or Dragonite. Additionally, dual screen setters, like Alolan Ninetales, can help against priority and assist Deoxys-S in setting up Nasty Plots. Psychic Terrain from Indeedee is another option due to it blocking priority, and it also boosts Deoxys-S’s Psychic-type STAB moves. This Deoxys-S set uses Heavy-Duty Boots for more longevity, which makes it a great anti-offense tool. Knock Off allows Deoxys-S to punish pivots like Galarian Slowking and Corviknight and threatens defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Moltres by removing their items. Superpower lets it threaten dangerous Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Darkrai as well as other Pokemon such as Blissey. Ice Beam makes quick work of both Gliscor and Landorus-T, preventing them from setting entry hazards or pivoting out. The EV spread allows Deoxys-S to outspeed Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk. Tera Fighting allows Deoxys-S to survive a Sucker Punch from Kingambit and dispatch it on the spot with Superpower, and getting a chance to 2HKO Ting-Lu with Superpower can also come in handy. This set fits well on bulky offense and balance teams, as it provides the necessary speed control for teams, forcing out strong yet frail sweepers with its coverage as well as helping soften more defensive teams via Knock Off. This set struggles with Deoxys-S's lack of firepower combined with its frailty, making it hard to win games on its own. For these reasons, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Skarmory, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor are great partners because they make Deoxys-S's ability to remove items much more dangerous against Pokemon with Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots like Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Moltres. Wallbreakers like Gholdengo, Ogerpon-W, Weavile, and Kingambit appreciate Deoxys-S's efforts to soften up and cripple Pokemon with Knock Off, allowing them to break through defensive teams more easily. Slow bulky pivots like Galarian Slowking and Corviknight can tank hits and bring Deoxys-S safely onto the field. Corviknight also helps defensively by checking Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon, giving Deoxys-S another layer of security. Alomomola provides momentum via Flip Turn and Wish support to keep Deoxys-S healthy. In return, Deoxys-S threatens Alomomola's greatest counter, Ogerpon-W, with STAB Psycho Boost. Skeledirge makes for an interesting partner, as it switches into common priority like Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, which it can then use as an opportunity to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp or start a snowball effect with Torch Song. Zamazenta is another great check to the aforementioned Dark-types, protecting Deoxys-S and using early-game chip damage to brute force its way to victory with Body Press. Deoxys-S and Zamazenta can work in tandem to pressure Galarian Slowking with the combination of Knock Off and Crunch, respectively. With its unmatched Speed stat, access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, and ability to shut down opposing leads with Taunt, Deoxys-S is a premier entry hazard-setting lead for hyper offense teams in the OU metagame. Taunt is its greatest virtue, allowing it to prevent leads like Glimmora and Ting-Lu from setting their own hazards. This also serves to deny dual screens from opposing Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales, stop setup sweepers like Raging Bolt and Kingambit from using it as setup fodder, and prevent Cinderace from using Court Change on its hazards. Deoxys-S's last moveslot is more flexible; Psycho Boost gives Deoxys-S a high power STAB option to reliably deal damage, notably improving the matchup against lead Glimmora by preventing it from using Mortal Spin against Deoxys-S for free while also threatening to OHKO Great Tusk. Alternatively, Skill Swap is an option that allows for Deoxys-S to get up entry hazards against Hatterene by removing its Magic Bounce while also having the potential to remove Gliscor's Poison Heal and Serperior's Contrary to give a partner free turns to set up after Deoxys-S goes down, particularly in conjunction with Taunt to deny their Toxic and Glare respectively. Focus Sash is Deoxys-S's best item choice, potentially allowing it to set up multiple layers of hazards while also giving it insurance to take a hit and safely use Taunt on an opposing lead, but Mental Herb can instead be considered to block Taunt from opposing Deoxys-S and win the lead matchup. An EV spread maximizing Speed with a Timid nature is optimal for the tie with opposing Deoxys-S, while maximum Special Attack is selected to power up a set using Psycho Boost; for Skill Swap Deoxys-S, maximum HP is used instead. Tera Ghost is optimal on Deoxys-S for its ability to block Rapid Spin from Iron Treads, Torkoal, and Excadrill, while Tera Steel is a more niche option that grants it an immunity to Glimmora's Mortal Spin. Deoxys-S is an excellent fit on hyper offense teams that appreciate both entry hazards being set on the opponent's side of the field and hazards being denied in return by Taunt. This makes setup sweepers like Raging Bolt and Kingambit great pairings, as hazards can be used to wear down their checks like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk; these Pokemon themselves also enjoy hazards being kept off of their side of the field, with the latter two in particular appreciating the freedom to use a boosting item or Leftovers. Another offensive threat that enjoys hazards being able to wear down switch-ins is Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, itself able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from targets like Dondozo with Knock Off to take full advantage of Deoxys-S's hazards. Many other offensive sweepers benefit greatly from hazard support from Deoxys-S, with Darkrai and Iron Valiant being fantastic partners that take advantage of checks like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Primarina being forced to take hazard damage. Deoxys-S's strongest partner in this regard though is Gholdengo, which crucially blocks Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads along with Defog from Corviknight to ensure that Deoxys-S's hazards remain on the field for the rest of the game even after Deoxys-S goes down. Gholdengo additionally benefits from hazard support itself, as both Ting-Lu and Kingambit taking hazards upon switching into it can assist it greatly with breaking through a team. Unfortunately, despite Deoxys-S possessing the highest unboosted Speed in the tier, it does have some less than positive lead matchups; Booster Energy Iron Treads is able to outrun Deoxys-S and set up Stealth Rock against it while being able to remove Deoxys-S's hazards with Rapid Spin unless it chooses to Tera Ghost, and Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge regardless of Taunt before potentially picking Deoxys-S off with Aqua Jet after bringing it down to its Focus Sash. Forms of hazard removal that are still able to fit well onto a hyper offensive team are therefore appreciated, with Bulk Up Great Tusk able to provide excellent role compression as both a sweeper and a hazard remover with Rapid Spin. Strong priority users like Rillaboom and Dragonite can also choose to lead off and prevent Deoxys-S from being able to get up a second layer of hazards with their priority attacks; Booster Energy Iron Boulder can use Swords Dance on Deoxys-S before it can use Taunt without fearing a Psycho Boost; and specially defensive Pelipper is able to safely use U-turn on Deoxys-S to break its Focus Sash, bring in a Swift Swim user like Barraskewda, and deny more than one layer of hazards. Hence, offensive checks to these Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Dragonite themselves, Great Tusk, and Kingambit can help to patch up those matchups, with the latter three able to not only force out these threats but take advantage of them with their own setup options. Thanks to its unparalleled Speed tier and access to an array of solid utility options, Deoxys-S is one of the best dual screens setters in OU. Taunt is key in preventing Pokemon like Glimmora, Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T from laying entry hazards, setup threats such as Swords Dance Ogerpon-W from boosting, and Cinderace from using Court Change. Psycho Boost lets Deoxys-S have some sort of offensive presence; it can obliterate lead Glimmora while overwhelming neutral targets like Dondozo and physically defensive Skeledirge. Deoxys-S generally should not Terastallize, as being unable to Terastallize a wallbreaker later in the match could be game ending. However, in a pinch, Tera Steel can let it more easily set dual screens against priority users like Weavile, Dragonite, and Rillaboom. Deoxys-S is a fixture on dual screens hyper offense teams thanks to its absolutely blazing Speed that surpasses every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, letting it ensure at least one of Reflect or Light Screen go up. Setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Serperior are amazing at making use of Deoxys-S's screens support, taking a hit from Deoxys-S's potential revenge killers such as Kingambit and Cinderace with it and being able to strike back strong. Cleaners such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and Choice Scarf Enamorus are similarly potent behind dual screens. Due to Ceaseless Edge, Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be denied by Deoxys-S, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Hisuian Samurott such as Iron Valiant and Enamorus are good teammates. Entry hazard control options like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Hatterene also make for good partners in the event that Deoxys-S is unable to prevent hazards being set. Great Tusk and Hatterene in particular can double as potent bulky setup sweepers with Bulk Up and Calm Mind, respectively. Other bulky setup Pokemon like Latias and Iron Crown benefit similarly from screens."

  "Diancie": {
    "name": "Diancie",
    "text": "Diancie's great typing lets it switch in easily against common dangerous Fire- and Flying-, and Normal-types such as Chandelure, Talonflame, Oricorio-E, and Porygon-Z. With well-rounded stats, Diancie can easily go both offensive and defensive, with its sets being supported by its large movepool. Specially defensive Diancie is a great check to special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Kilowattrel and Hisuian Typhlosion, and it can carry Encore to circumvent its passivity when against setup sweepers. Trick Room sets can easily turn the tables versus faster, more offensive teams, as Diancie can outspeed and KO everything after it gets its Special Attack boost from Meteor Beam. With a specially defensive EV spread, Diancie is able to repeatedly switch into special attacks, giving it opportunities to set up Stealth Rock and fire off STAB Diamond Storm. Body Press hits Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel trying to switch in on Diancie, and it can take advantage of Diamond Storm's chance to boost its Defense. Encore prevents Diancie's passivity from getting taken advantage of too easily by opposing hazard setters and setup sweepers, such as Klefki and Iron Thorns alike, but Moonblast can be used to be able to hit Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon harder. Tera types for this set are focused on flipping Diancie's matchups. Tera Water gives Diancie a resistance to Steel- and Water-type attacks, letting it finish off Copperajah and Inteleon while maintaining its Fire resistance. However, Tera Steel trades Diancie's matchup against Fire-types for a strong defensive typing thay can take on hits from Munkidori, Sylveon, and Tsareena without issue. Tera Dragon on the other hand lets Diancie take on Rotom-C and Araquanid, but it completely throws away its matchup against Dragalge and Florges. Fire-types like Incineroar and Talonflame make for strong partners because they threaten Steel- and Grass-types that force Diancie out, such as Bronzong, Registeel, Tsareena, and Brambleghast. The aforementioned Grass-types, along with Rotom-C, also have great synergy with Diancie, as it checks Fire- and Flying-types for them. In return, they handle Ground- and Water-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Inteleon. Diancie can't take on physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak and Mienshao too well, so physically defensive Pokemon like Swampert, Dragalge, and Talonflame pair well with it to help check these threats. With an offensive spread, the Trick Room set is capable of taking down many foes. Earth Power offers coverage for the Steel -and Poison-types that can take Diancie's Moonblast comfortably such as Registeel, Copperajah, and Tentacruel. Power Herb allows Diancie to immediately attack and get its Special Attack boost with Meteor Beam. Tera Grass gives Diancie a resistance to Grass-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks while giving it a neutrality to Steel-type moves, letting it set up Trick Room and attack more easily. Alternatively, Tera Ground is an option to boost Earth Power's damage, which is really appreciated to get KOs it wouldn't otherwise. A lead to set up entry hazards such as Brambleghast or Froslass makes for a great partner, as it can help chip checks like Registeel, Alolan Muk, and Tentacruel into range for a KO. Mienshao and Breloom enjoy how Diancie can come in on and take advantage of Talonflame, and with it being downed, they don't need to worry about being revenge killed as easily or getting burned. Pokemon like Flygon, Drednaw, Oricorio-E, Galarian Articuno, and Iron Thorns that can chip away at and weaken Steel-types like Registeel and Copperajah for Diancie pair well with it too. Diancie can run Rock Polish for a more permanent Speed boost, but with its low-base Speed, it's easily outpaced by Choice Scarf users like Flygon, Inteleon, and Mienshao even after it boosts. A Sticky Web setter is great for this set, as it attempts to solve Diancie's low speed issue. If there is already a Stealth Rock user on Diancie's team, it can run Spikes instead so that it can continue to provide entry hazard support. Specially defensive sets can run a more specially oriented moveset, with moves like Moonblast, Earth Power, and Power Gem being run over Diamond Storm and Body Press. Diancie can also run a sweeper set with a moveset of Calm Mind / Iron Defense / Draining Kiss / Stored Power, which can take advantage of passive or weaker Pokemon quite well, but it can be easily overpowered by any wallbreaker or Trick, Encore and Taunt users. Diancie can also run offensive sets with Stealth Rock and Spikes, usually with Moonblast and Earth Power supporting it; however it is considered a bit suboptimal, since its bulk is usually appreciated to set entry hazards up safely. Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types like Bronzong, Registeel, and Copperajah can easily switch in on Diancie and set up entry hazards, forcing it out or making it use Tera in order to survive an attack and KO them. In particular, Bronzong is quite bothersome for Diancie, as it walls its STAB attacks and is immune to Earth Power thanks to Levitate. However, all of these Steel-types lack a form of reliable recovery making them easily overwhelmed over the course of a battle. Both Bronzong and Registeel take a lot of damage from +2 Body Press and +1 Earth Power, respectively, so after some chip damage, Diancie can beat them. Ground-types: Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon are trouble for Diancie, as they threaten Diancie out with their Ground-type STAB attacks and can take advantage of it by setting up entry hazards. If Diancie is running Moonblast, it can somewhat damage them, but if its not, it is an almost free switch-in for them, as Earth Power and Body Press aren't doing enough to threaten them. Water-types: Offensive or defensive Water-types such as Inteleon, Basculegion, and Vaporeon can all threaten Diancie with their STAB attacks. They can also use Diancie for momentum and pivot with U-turn or Flip Turn, and they can even force Diancie to Terastallize or switch out. Inteleon and Basculegion both cannot deal with Diancie when under Trick Room, as they get defeated before they can act. Grass-types: Offensive Grass-types such as Torterra and Tsareena make progress against and threaten Diancie; however they can't comfortably switch in on offensive sets. Torterra and Tsareena force Diancie to switch out or Terastallize, and the latter can even remove its Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Both of those Pokémon can't defeat Diancie when in Trick Room, as they get KOed first by +1 Moonblast"

  "Diglett-Alola": {
    "name": "Diglett-Alola",
    "text": "Alolan Diglett finds itself a niche thanks to its incredible Speed tier that lets it outspeed almost every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, decent Attack stat, and great, spammable STAB moves. Iron Head acts as a secondary STAB option that hits Pokemon that resist Earthquake like Grookey and Toedscool, whereas Sucker Punch gives Alolan Diglett priority, which is helpful to deal with faster setup sweepers like Shellder and Torchic as well as Choice Scarf Gothita and Hisuian Growlithe. Rock Blast is valuable coverage to hit Flying-types like Vullaby and Wattrel for super effective damage. Substitute is useful to allow Alolan Diglett to capitalize on the switches it forces on Pokemon like Mareanie, Glimmet, and Tinkatink while also allowing it to outplay Sucker Punches from Pawniard and Stunky. Life Orb gives a useful power boost, allowing Alolan Diglett to 2HKO Hisuian Voltorb and Mienfoo with Earthquake and 2HKO Toedscool with Iron Head. While a Jolly nature guarantees outspeeding Skunky and tying other Alolan Diglett, an Adamant nature greatly increases Alolan Diglett's power, allowing it to 2HKO Foongus with Earthquake. Tera Ground boosts Alolan Diglett's Earthquake to become even more spammable while also achieving damage thresholds like OHKOing itemless Mienfoo and 2HKOing Foongus, but Tera Dark boosts Sucker Punch while also giving a valuable resistance to opposing Sucker Punches. Alolan Diglett fits on teams looking for a strong and reliable revenge killer and physical attacker. Alolan Diglett's relative fraility means it is easily OHKOed if it can't KO its target, so Knock Off support from Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Stunky can help chip down the opposing team for Alolan Diglett. U-turn from Mienfoo, Grookey, and Vullaby can help Alolan Diglett come onto the battlefield to start attacking. Alolan Diglett struggles with bulky physical walls like Mudbray and Grass-types like Grookey and Toedscool, so Pokemon that can deal with these threats like Hisuian Voltorb and Hisuian Growlithe make great partners."

  "Dipplin": {
    "name": "Dipplin",
    "text": "Dipplin is a fantastic check to physical attackers like Hisuian Decidueye, Regirock, and Passimian thanks to its substantial physical bulk and ability to absorb Knock Off. Dipplin's walling capabilities give it many opportunities to set up Growth against passive or ineffective foes like Sandaconda and Brute Bonnet to function as a bulky sweeper. Dragon Tail phazes setup sweepers that might try to break through Dipplin such as Snorlax, Virizion, and Calm Mind Dudunsparce. Giga Drain keeps Dipplin healthy as it attacks to make it less reliant on Recover to quickly devour Pokemon weak to Grass like Regirock, Palossand, and Sandaconda. Sticky Hold distinguishes Dipplin from other NFE Pokemon dependent on their Eviolite such as Rhydon and Porygon2 by protecting Dipplin from Knock Off, Switcheroo, and Trick from users like Grafaiai and Mesprit. Tera Poison improves Dipplin's matchups against Fighting-types like Hisuian Sneasel, allowing it to maintain good matchups against Poison-types like Grafaiai and Hisuian Qwilfish as well as an immunity to poison at the cost of vulnerability to Mesprit and Farigiraf. Tera Fairy protects Dipplin from Dragon Tail users like Coil Dudunsparce and opposing Dipplin, and it improves Dipplin's vulnerability to Alolan Exeggutor and Appletun. Tera Steel turns the tables against checks like Glastrier, Sneasel, and Tera Fairy Mesprit and protects Dipplin from poison from Grafaiai, the Qwilfish formes, and Muk at the cost of worsening its matchups against Fighting-types. Dipplin's capability to absorb Knock Off makes it a great partner to Pokemon that are reliant on their items, including Articuno, Regirock, and Hisuian Qwilfish. Snorlax is an excellent partner to handle threats to Dipplin like Articuno, Typhlosion, and Charizard, and Dipplin takes physical attacks and Knock Off from Hisuian Decidueye, Passimian, and Lycanroc for Snorlax in return. Dipplin amplifies residual damage from entry hazard stacking thanks to Dragon Tail, so hazard setters like Hisuian Qwilfish, Orthworm, Qwilfish, and Sandslash have great synergy with Dipplin. Knock Off users like Mesprit, Passimian, and Grafaiai can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes to ensure they take damage from entry hazards when Dipplin uses Dragon Tail. Teammates weak to Water and Grass like Regirock, Sandaconda, and Sandslash appreciate Dipplin taking on Floatzel, Brute Bonnet, Lanturn, and Virizion for them. Teammates like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Orthworm can handle special attackers with Fairy- and Ice-type coverage for Dipplin, offensively checking Whimsicott, Frosmoth, and Articuno. Regirock, Naclstack, and Rhydon help Dipplin by defensively answering Flying-types like Dodrio, Charizard, and the Oricorio formes for it. Dipplin is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by chip damage from hazards, so it depends on partners with hazard removal like Cramorant and Sandslash to mitigate this vulnerability. Dipplin's shallow movepool leaves little room for variety. Tera Water eliminates its Ice weakness and defensively answers Floatzel and Glastrier, but it does not fix Dipplin's vulnerability to Articuno's Freeze-Dry and worsens its matchups against Grass-type physical attackers like Hisuian Decidueye, Virizion, and Brute Bonnet that it would otherwise check. Whimsicott: The Grass / Fairy typing leaves Whimsicott barely scratched by Dipplin's Giga Drain and immune to Dragon Tail. Even without Choice Specs, Whimsicott has a 93.4% chance to 2HKO Dipplin with Moonblast. Even if Dipplin Terastallizes, pivot Whimsicott sets can lock Dipplin into a non-damaging move with Encore and whittle it down. Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage: Articuno 2HKOes Dipplin with Freeze-Dry, has great bulk and Roost, can remove Dipplin's boosts with Haze or Roar if it Terastallizes, and can PP stall Dipplin with Pressure. Cryogonal has Freeze-Dry, recovery, and Haze similar to Articuno but isn't as bulky. Sneasel, Glastrier, and Hisuian Avalugg overcome Dipplin's massive Defense by exploiting its 4x Ice weakness, but Dipplin Terastallizing sours their positive matchups against it. Frosmoth OHKOes Dipplin with Ice Beam and can still overpower it even if it Terastallizes thanks to its high Special Attack. Choice Band Floatzel 2HKOes Dipplin with Ice Spinner. Flying-types: Charizard 2HKOes Dipplin with Hurricane and can switch in while Dipplin uses Growth, Recover, or Giga Drain. The Oricorio formes similarly 2HKO Dipplin with Hurricane, threaten to set up on Dipplin with Quiver Dance, and can Taunt Dipplin. Braviary can use Bulk Up and Brave Bird to power through Dipplin while avoiding Dragon Tail with Substitute. Uninvested Cramorant has a 49.2% chance to 2HKO Dipplin with Hurricane. Dodrio can cut through Dipplin's physical bulk if it gains a Swords Dance boost. Strong Special Attackers: Choice Specs Jolteon 2HKOes Dipplin with Alluring Voice. Shaymin can exploit the Special Defense drops from Seed Flare and one of its coverage moves to break through Dipplin, and it has the bulk to take boosted hits from Dipplin. Alolan Exeggutor takes a big chunk of damage from Dragon Tail but can switch in on Recover, Growth, or Giga Drain and exploit the negative priority of Dragon Tail to blow Dipplin away with Draco Meteor. Vikavolt 2HKOes Dipplin with Bug Buzz and can comfortably take attacks from Dipplin. Clawitzer must be wary of Giga Drain but has a 68.8% chance to OHKO Dipplin with a Choice Specs-boosted Dragon Pulse. Tera Fairy Users: Dipplin's dependence on Dragon Tail to phaze setup sweepers makes it setup fodder for Tera Fairy users like Nasty Plot Mesprit, Calm Mind Jolteon, and Mismagius. Coil Dudunsparce has a harder time breaking through Dipplin compared to Calm Mind users but can phaze Dipplin with Dragon Tail or fish for poison with Poison Jab to wear it down. Snorlax must fish for paralysis with Body Slam but can overcome Dipplin in the long run with luck. Residual Damage: Dipplin relies on its Eviolite for its bulk and is vulnerable to damaging entry hazards, which force it to use its limited Recover more often and become more passive. Toxic from Dudunsparce, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Qwilfish puts Dipplin on a timer and prevents it from gaining enough boosts to sweep. Even burns from switching into ideal foes like Palossand hurt Dipplin's longevity and dampen the power of its Dagon Tail. Weezing can fish for a poison on Dipplin with Sludge Bomb, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, and wash away its boosts with Haze. Haze and Phazing: Weezing and Muk can wipe Dipplin's boosts with Haze and threaten it with their Poison-type STAB moves, and they have the bulk to take even boosted hits from Dipplin. Dudunsparce can phaze Dipplin first with Dragon Tail before getting phazed itself. Encore: Sableye can switch in as Dipplin sets up and lock it into a non-damaging move like Growth or Recover. Even if Dipplin Terastallizes to improve its matchups against them, Mesprit and Grafaiai can still disrupt it."

    "text": "With massive physical bulk and Unaware, Dondozo is a robust physical wall that is capable of checking some of the tier's most prevalent threats, such as Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit. Waterfall is Dondozo's STAB move of choice, with high PP and lack of a drawback, and does decent damage to potential switch-ins like Gholdengo and Iron Valiant looking to scare Dondozo out, while Body Press can instead more effectively handle the likes of Kingambit and Roaring Moon and let Dondozo hit Ogerpon-W. Curse can make Dondozo a potent threat, increasing both its offensive potential and defensive capabilities, including letting it better check potent threats like Tera Dark Kingambit. Avalanche can be run instead to 2HKO Tera Flying Roaring Moon, also able to punish Grass-types like Rillaboom and Serperior that might otherwise fearlessly switch into Dondozo. RestTalk helps Dondozo stay healthy and avoid status while potentially continuing to make progress or set up, depending on the Sleep Talk rolls. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Dondozo switch safely into powerful attackers repeatedly without taking entry hazard damage, while Leftovers can be used instead to provide more reliable recovery than Rest. Tera Fighting powers up Dondozo's Body Press, allowing it to get more mileage out of its naturally high Defense and Curse boosts, and lets it more effectively check Kingambit thanks to the Dark resistance it provides; Tera Dark can help Dondozo check special attackers like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Stored Power Latias in a pinch as well as non-Low Kick Kingambit variants; and Tera Grass can be used to flip its weaknesses, letting it resist normally dangerous attacks from Rillaboom and Serperior and effectively check Ogerpon-W, which can give bulkier teams trouble. Dondozo is generally found on bulkier teams that appreciate its ability to easily check a number of threatening setup sweepers and other fearsome physical attackers like Kingambit. Despite its enormous physical bulk, Dondozo's special bulk leaves much to be desired, so it pairs well with specially defensive walls like Blissey and Clodsire that can handle Pokemon like Raging Bolt. Dondozo is a passive Pokemon that is checked by other bulky Pokemon like Alomomola, which can also use it as fodder to pass Wishes to Pokemon like Ursaluna, and Clefable, and so it benefits from teammates like Gliscor and Clefable that have more offensive presence and can make progress against them or act as Knock Off absorbers for it. On balance teams, offensive partners like Great Tusk and Weavile help threaten Dondozo's checks like Rillaboom and Raging Bolt while in turn benefitting from its ability to check Kingambit. Ogerpon-W is particularly annoying for Dondozo thanks to Water Absorb and is difficult to check without using Tera, so teammates like Amoonguss and Hydrapple that can handle it while also helping against threats like Rillaboom are appreciated, though the latter loses to Play Rough variants. If Dondozo runs Leftovers, entry hazard removers like Talonflame, which can threaten Defog against Gholdengo, and Corviknight are necessary partners to keep Dondozo healthy through repeated switches while also doubling as checks to Rillaboom and Meowscarada. Alomomola is a great partner for passing Wish to Dondozo, helping it be less reliant on Rest for recovery as well as potentially burning physical threats like Roaring Moon and Weavile to help it take as little damage as possible from stronger physical attackers."

Bulkier sets can come in on walls like Vileplume and take advantage of them by setting Toxic Spikes, causing the rest of their team to suffer. On the other hand, Choice Specs sets provide a ton of nuking power with Adaptability, allowing Dragalge to break through former counters like Umbreon and Registeel. However, Dragalge lacks good Speed, meaning it often can't retaliate before strong attackers overwhelm it. Bulkier sets are also held back due to a lack of access to recovery moves and Dragalge’s below-average HP. Dragalge’s typing too, at times, can be somewhat limiting, since Ground- and Steel-types are fairly common in NU. Toxic Spikes allows Dragalge to chip away at walls, while Dragon Tail can phaze Dragalge’s checks as well as setup sweepers. Flip Turn works amazingly on Dragalge, letting it act as a bulky pivot that can bring in powerful wallbreakers. The given EV spread allows Dragalge to outspeed Vileplume while giving it some physical bulk to aid with Fighting-types like Mienshao and Infernape. Tera Steel allows Dragalge to take Psychic-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks from foes like Munkidori, Sylveon, and opposing Dragalge. On the other hand, Tera Water alleviates its weakness to Ground-type attacks while giving it an overall strong defensive typing. Toxic Spikes lowers switch rates when your opponent tries to play around them, so Pokemon that can scare out Poison-types and cause switches like Flygon and Future Sight Galarian Articuno can overwhelm your opponents. Partners that can bring in physically defensive Pokemon such as Mienshao and Infernape gift Dragalge with chances to set Toxic Spikes. In the face of Steel-types like Klefki and Copperajah, Dragalge fails to do much, so partners that can take advantage of its Flip Turn and deal with these pests, like Gallade, Mienshao, and Flare Blitz Talonflame, work well. Opposing Dragon- and Fairy-type Pokemon also cause issues for Dragalge, as they’re usually faster and can severely damage or KO Dragalge before it can react. Teammates that help alleviate this weakness such as Sylveon, Registeel, and Copperajah are appreciated. Dragalge’s limited HP also hinders it; to ensure its survival for longer, entry hazard removers or Wish users like Talonflame, Brambleghast, and Vaporeon can be used. Pokemon like Vileplume and Tsareena that can handle more offensive Ground-types such as Flygon and Torterra can help out Dragalge. Sludge Wave is preferred for damage output, but Sludge Bomb can more reliably poison specially defensive Pokemon like Gastrodon and Umbreon. Focus Blast can heavily dent many Steel-types on the switch-in like Registeel, Klefki, and Copperajah. Tera Blast Ground can be used instead to hit these targets more accurately and powerfully along with Alolan Muk; however, this comes at the cost of Terastallizing, making it not as favored of an option overall. For the last move, a way to pivot in Flip Turn is preferred to bring a partner in on a wall it would otherwise have trouble with. The given EVs let Dragalge outpace Vaporeon and Umbreon with the rest poured into HP. An alternative and bulkier EV spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe can be run, as it gives Dragalge enough Speed to outrun uninvested Sylveon. Tera Poison grants Dragalge a resistance to Fairy while also powering Sludge Wave to preposterous levels; however, a more defensive Tera type like Tera Steel could be used to help Dragalge retaliate after surviving Psychic- and Dragon-type attacks. Dragalge’s low Speed tends to hinder it a lot, but this can be negated with pivot cores. Dragalge draws in Steel-types, but it can use Flip Turn to let Mienshao or Flygon handle them. On the other hand, Mienshao and Flygon themselves can use U-turn after drawing in a physical wall like Vileplume or Quagsire, which Dragalge preys on. Dragalge can also whittle down Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel over time with a strong Focus Blast, so Pokemon that can take advantage of this such as Munkidori, Reuniclus, and Calm Mind Sylveon enjoy its presence. Special walls like Alolan Muk, Gastrodon, and Registeel love to come in on Dragalge, so strong physical wallbreakers like Gallade and Incineroar work well to deal with these checks. Scald can be used on bulkier Dragalge sets to try to burn checks like Copperajah and Klefki, but this causes Dragalge to lose out on pressure in Toxic Spikes or momentum in Flip Turn. A moveset consisting of Substitute / Sludge Bomb / Dragon Pulse / Focus Blast or Tera Blast Ground can be used with Leftovers to significantly capitalize on forced switches and take advantage of more passive Pokemon. But this can hurt Dragalge's longevity quite a bit, and, in general, opportunities aren’t too common. Ground-types: Ground-types like Flygon and Torterra are difficult to handle for Dragalge, as they’re always faster and can hit it with their powerful STAB Earthquake. Steel-types: Steel-types like Registeel and Tera Steel Sylveon wall Dragalge's STAB moves, meaning they can come in and take advantage of it often and only fear Focus Blast. Also, Klefki loves to come in on any of Dragalge’s attacks and spread status or set Spikes. Psychic-types: Dragalge struggles against the plethora of Psychic-types like Gallade, Indeedee, and Munkidori. All of these Pokemon easily scare out Dragalge with their Psychic-type STAB moves and also tend to be able to take a hit from it. Special Walls: Special walls like Alolan Muk, Assault Vest Gallade, Bronzong, and Diancie take on Dragalge’s attacks easily and can threaten it with Knock Off, super effective damage, or a physical attack. All of these Pokemon don’t have a very reliable source of healing, though, so they tend to be whittled down over the course of a battle."

    "name": "Dragapult",
    "text": "Dragapult is one of OU's best pivots, with its massive base Speed stat allowing it to dance around slower threats, spread status and deal significant damage over the course of a game. Dragon Darts is a strong STAB option that hits key targets in the tier such as Roaring Moon, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Draco Meteor can be used with an EV spread fully invested into Special Attack that lets it secure an OHKO into Walking Wake while also giving Dragapult a more powerful Hex to 2HKO even max HP Gholdengo, but the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor leaves it vulnerable to being used as setup fodder, and this set is also weaker into sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Raging Bolt. Both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great options that synergize with the rest of Dragapult's toolkit by doubling the power of Hex; Will-O-Wisp turns Dragapult into a great fast check that can outrun and neutralize physical threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Kingambit while also forcing chip on Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire that try to switch in, while Thunder Wave cripples burn-immune targets like Clefable and Cinderace and slows down special attackers like Darkrai, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant to help teammates deal with them more easily. Tera Fairy is a great defensive option that flips Dragapult's Dragon weakness into an immunity while also granting a Dark resistance to resist hits from Kingambit and Darkrai, whereas Tera Ghost powers up Hex while still dropping its weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon to help block revenge killing attempts by Enamorus. The Attack EVs allow Dragapult to OHKO Roaring Moon and 2HKO Hisuian Samurott with Dragon Darts from full health. Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult is a fantastic pick on balance teams, synergizing well with durable hazard setters such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu that can assist in chipping down the switch-ins that it forces. In return, Dragapult helps to patch up bulkier teams' lack of speed control while not minding the hazards that they often allow on both sides of the field. Knock Off users such as Weavile and Meowscarada are solid pairings with Dragapult on these balance structures, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon to make the switches that Dragapult forces more meaningful while giving Dragapult opportunities to come in for free on their own checks, allowing these teams to better pressure opposing Skarmory and Corviknight. Bulkier offense teams also benefit from the presence of Dragapult as a form of speed control that wears down defensive cores with both damage and status effects; Kingambit in particular is a terrifying late-game sweeper that appreciates Dragapult's ability to weaken a team for it to clean through, with Will-O-Wisp Dragapult able to neuter its physical checks like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Skarmory, while Thunder Wave variants can slow down threats that would otherwise outspeed Kingambit such as Cinderace and Heatran. In turn, Dragapult often invites in opposing Kingambit, which resists its STAB options and is only threatened by its status moves, so solid switch-ins for this like Skarmory and Great Tusk are usually appreciated to prevent it from getting too many free turns. Raging Bolt in particular is a strong partner to pivot Dragapult on bulky offense teams that enjoy its support to help break through Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and specially defensive Gliscor. Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult also struggles to muscle past bulkier checks like Toxapex and Clefable alone, so partners that can take advantage of them for setup opportunities such as Kingambit and Gholdengo are great picks. As Dragapult's Speed tier is almost unmatched in the OU metagame, Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder along with the even faster Deoxys-S are frequently forced in to revenge kill it, so more defensive teammates that can handle these threats are valued; Galarian Slowking is a good bulky pivot that takes on Iron Valiant and can use Chilly Reception to bring in Dragapult for free after taking a hit, while Gliscor, Corviknight, and Skarmory are solid Iron Boulder checks that can either beat it or force it to switch out and lose its Speed boost, allowing Dragapult to outspeed it later. Corviknight doubles as an answer to Deoxys-S, able to take on any of its attacks and safely pivot out with U-turn. Dragapult is an amazing source of immediate power due to its near unresisted STAB combination, solid Special Attack, and excellent Speed tier, which outspeeds the majority of the unboosted metagame except Deoxys-S. Equipping Choice Specs allows Dragapult to break through Pokemon such as Gliscor and Zamazenta with its STAB moves. Flamethrower threatens Kingambit. U-turn allows Dragapult to keep the momentum for its team and hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to be a great check to dual screens teams and Substitute sweepers such as Iron Defense Zamazenta. Tera Ghost powers up its most spammable STAB attack in Shadow Ball, allowing Dragapult to further dent Galarian Slowking and secure the OHKO on Iron Valiant and Skeledirge. This also improves its matchup into Iron Valiant and Enamorus, as it takes much less damage from Moonblast, allowing it to survive a hit and KO them back. Tera Dragon raises Draco Meteor to nuclear levels, OHKOing Gliscor, Dondozo, and defensive Landorus-T, and it also improves Dragapult's matchup into Darkrai and Gholdengo, as it removes it weakness to Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball, respectively. A Modest nature can be run instead of Timid to forego outspeeding Zamazenta, Weavile, and Darkrai for higher damage output, such as OHKOing Gliscor and Serperior with Draco Meteor. Dragapult fits well on offensive teams due to its excellent ability to break down walls such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Therefore, Dragapult is able to benefit sweepers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt that appreciate walls being worn down. Dark- and Fairy-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Clefable are threats to Dragapult, as they are able to switch in and force it out. Therefore, checks to these such as Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta make for good partners. The latter two help with Kingambit, which is Dragapult's biggest check due to resisting both of its STAB moves. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards on the opposing side of the field. Therefore, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Gliscor are good partners for it. Knock Off support from the likes of Weavile, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada are able to be brought in by Dragapult's U-turn, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive switch-ins to force progress. Meowscarada in particular is a great partner, since it’s able to bring Dragapult in with its own U-turn, allowing Dragapult to better pressure its checks. Dragapult is not very good at switching into attacks, as it is relatively frail, so slow pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola are amazing teammates. Entry hazards wear down Dragapult over time, limiting the number of times it can switch onto the field; therefore, hazard control from Great Tusk and Cinderace can help Dragapult. Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Pokemon with a Speed Boost such as Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant are able to outspeed and threaten to KO Dragapult, so speed control like Rillaboom, Raging Bolt and Kingambit make for good teammates. Focus Sash Dragapult is an excellent status spreader and emergency check to various threats due to its incredible Speed, outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon except Deoxys-S, and Hex, which rewards status spreading further and hits status absorbers like Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Hatterene hard. Dragon Darts makes Dragapult a potent mixed wallbreaker, letting it slice through special walls like Clodsire and Blissey as well as Special Defense-boosting Pokemon like Raging Bolt. Draco Meteor is an alternative option to OHKO Walking Wake as well as Raging Bolt after Stealth Rock. However, its imperfect accuracy, Special Attack drops, and inability to hit most special walls for good damage compromises Dragapult's offensive capabilities. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave combine to allow Dragapult to cripple nearly the entire metagame with the exceptions of Gholdengo and Garganacl as well as Blissey if it is running Draco Meteor over Dragon Darts. Will-O-Wisp is primarily good against physical attackers and Ground-types like Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu, while Thunder Wave is used against special attackers, fast Pokemon, and burn-immune targets like Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and Tera Fire Zamazenta. Dragapult should run a Hasty nature when using Dragon Darts to hit hard physically and specially, but with Draco Meteor, it can run a Timid nature. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to status and revenge kill Substitute users like Zamazenta, Serperior, and Iron Moth. Tera Ghost gives Dragapult enough power to nearly always OHKO Skeledirge with a status-boosted Hex and 2HKO specially defensive Gliscor after Protect. Tera Dragon boosts Dragon Darts and Draco Meteor, allowing Dragon Darts to 2HKO Galarian Slowking and Blissey and Draco Meteor to OHKO Pokemon like Meowscarada, Raging Bolt without entry hazard chip, and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Fairy gives Dragapult a Dragon immunity and Dark resistance, which can allow it to survive hits from Pokemon like opposing Dragapult, Kingambit, and Choice Scarf Darkrai, especially if its Focus Sash is no longer intact. Dragapult fits on offensive teams that appreciate its emergency checking of many of the tier's scariest threats with its ability to paralyze and burn foes while still being offensively threatening. Dragapult's ability to cripple offensive threats is beneficial to many wallbreakers and sweepers like Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Kingambit by giving them setup opportunities on burned physical attackers and paralyzed Pokemon. These Pokemon also appreciate Dragapult paralyzing faster Pokemon to gain the jump on them, while Dragapult appreciates their ability to come in on Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Terastallized Clodsire that wall it to force them out and wallbreak. Zamazenta and Kingambit appreciate Dragapult burning opposing Zamazenta, while Kingambit additionally appreciates opposing Kingambit being burned to win the mirror matchup. Raging Bolt has a much easier time breaking through burned Ting-Lu after Leftovers is neutralized while being able to take an Earthquake easier. Additionally, the aforementioned special attackers highly appreciate the Dragon Darts variant of Dragapult to wear down shared walls like Clodsire, Blissey, specially defensive Gliscor, and Ting-Lu. Dragapult's Focus Sash is broken by entry hazards, so Pokemon that can keep them off the field like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Taunt Deoxys-S, and Taunt Landorus-T are excellent partners. Dragapult struggles to make meaningful progress against Pokemon like Garganacl, which can be alleviated with Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Encore Iron Valiant, and Rillaboom. Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain can additionally heal chip damage Dragapult takes to potentially restore its Focus Sash. Dragapult is not foolproof, as entry hazards can often be hard to keep off the field long enough and it only has one one activation of Focus Sash. Because of this, it often needs teammates that can serve as secondary checks to the sweepers Dragapult tries to cripple. Zamazenta can check Pokemon like Booster Energy Great Tusk, Weavile, and Kingambit and doubles up on speed control. Gholdengo can help overwhelm Dark-types and even lure them with Dazzling Gleam and Focus Blast while also checking Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Priority users like Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and especially Dragonite and Rillaboom due to their more consistent priority moves can revenge kill Pokemon that Dragapult fails to status like Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which can OHKO it with Triple Axel. Faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant, +1 Roaring Moon, and Deoxys-S can also be problematic if Dragapult's Focus Sash is not maintained. Dragapult acts as a great offensive pivot for bulky offense and balance teams that rely on maintaining momentum and immediate power for their progress making. Its amazing Speed tier, the second fastest relevant Pokemon behind only Deoxys-S, makes it one of the best users of Choice Band, hitting foes for great neutral damage thanks to its hard-to-resist STAB moves Tera Blast Ghost lets it make use of a reliable and powerful physical Ghost-type move, 2HKOing otherwise problematic Steel- and Fairy-types such as Clefable and Corviknight after Stealth Rock Damage, and to create win-win scenarios thanks to the pivoting effect of its strong U-turn forcing progress even against bulkier cores and punishing Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu with heavy chip damage, especially if Spikes are up. Tera Dragon over Tera Ghost with Phantom Force over Tera Blast is a notable option to rely less on Terastallization in exchange for a worse Ghost-type move, OHKOing the likes of Galarian Slowking, Darkrai, Hisuian Samurott, and Glimmora through its Focus Sash and 2HKOing neutral targets like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Alomomola with little prior chip damage with Tera Dragon Dragon Darts while also shedding its Dark weakness. Quick Attack rounds Dragapult's moveset out, giving it access to priority to pick off weakened foes or other priority users, though other options include Sucker Punch, for a stronger hit on neutral targets and an advantage against opposing Dragapult, and Phantom Force to be less reliant on Tera. Clear Body is preferred, as it allows Dragapult to ignore Landorus-T's Intimidate and Sticky Web, though Infiltrator is still a valid alternative to ignore dual screens and threaten Substitute Iron Moth, Primarina, and Enamorus. Dragapult has great synergy with bulky VoltTurn cores, which allow Dragapult to easily get on and off the field and repeatedly scare out offensive threats such as Iron Moth, Iron Crown, Gholdengo, and Darkrai. Landorus-T and Hisuian Samurott are pivots that pair well with Dragapult, with the former switching well into Kingambit, Cinderace, Roaring Moon, and Zamazenta trying to revenge kill Dragapult while denying hazards from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Glimmora, Garganacl, and opposing Landorus-T with Taunt, and the latter's Knock Off variants removing Heavy-Duty Boots off of physical walls Dragapult might struggle with like Alomomola and Dondozo. They, alongside the likes of Garganacl, Clefable, and Gliscor, also provide entry hazards, putting foes like Ogerpon, Darkrai, opposing Hisuian Samurott, and Iron Valiant in range of an OHKO and Skarmory, Corviknight, offensive Great Tusk, and Alomomola in range of a 2HKO; Garganacl in particular is noteworthy for its ability to deal effectively with opposing Dragapult, as well as absorbing status that would otherwise severely limit Dragapult's effectiveness like burn from Alomomola, paralysis from Clefable, and Toxic from Gliscor. Rapid Spin support from the likes of Great Tusk, which also deals with Kingambit, or Magic Bounce support from Hatterene, which has a great matchup into Ting-Lu and Zamazenta variants lacking Heavy Slam and can absorb status, also benefits Dragapult. Corviknight is another good pivot, providing a Kingambit check for bulkier structures and dealing with sweepers such as Roaring Moon that can boost past Dragapult's Speed tier with Iron Defense or reliably removing hazards against teams without Gholdengo with Defog. Finally, Future Sight from Iron Crown, Galarian Slowking, or the previously mentioned Hatterene helps overwhelm defensive cores that rely on different Pokemon to take on physical and special attacks like Galarian Slowking + Alomomola or Corviknight, Blissey + Dondozo, and Iron Crown + Landorus-T. Iron Crown brings to the table fast pivoting and a strong offensive profile to better deal with Clefable while not letting Kingambit or Heatran switch in for free. In contrast, Galarian Slowking has slow pivoting and great longevity thanks to Regenerator. Similarly, offensive overlap with threats like Dragonite, Zamazenta, and Hisuian Samurott can be very effective at muscling past shared checks like Skarmory, Clefable, Zamazenta, Dondozo, and Alomomola with repeated pressure."

  "Dragonite": {
    "name": "Dragonite",
    "text": "As a bulky setup Pokemon with a vast movepool including some of the strongest priority in the tier in Extreme Speed, Dragon Dance Dragonite is a great cleaner for all manner of offensive teams. After a Dragon Dance, Dragonite outspeeds and threatens many common offensive Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and even Dragapult if using a Jolly nature. Extreme Speed is Dragonite's defining move, giving it a very strong and spammable attack that outruns other priority moves while hitting most of the tier for neutral damage. After Dragon Dance and Extreme Speed, Dragonite can pick from a wide range of coverage and utility moves depending on the team it finds itself on. Earthquake gives Dragonite a strong way to hit Steel-types that resist Extreme Speed like Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo while also giving Dragonite better immediate damage into bulky threats like Raging Bolt, Garganacl, and Skeledirge that take little damage from its other moves. Fire Punch allows Dragonite to threaten Skarmory due to its Earthquake immunity, as well as Air Balloon Steel-types like Gholdengo. Ice Spinner is the only way for Dragonite to immediately threaten tier staple Gliscor, which otherwise easily stalls out Dragonite with Toxic + Protect. It is also Dragonite's strongest option into most opposing Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, prevents Landorus-T from repeatedly switching in with Intimidate, and wears down Great Tusk quicker than other common coverage options. Roost is an option for teams that rely more on Dragonite defensively, letting it use its myriad resists to take on the likes of Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom multiple times in a game while restoring Multiscale. Encore helps Dragonite to pressure walls, entry hazard setters, and setup sweepers like Dondozo, Gliscor, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Dragon Claw is a STAB move with no drawbacks and good neutral coverage for two attack sets that want to use utility moves, Outrage gives Dragonite better breaking power against bulky neutral targets like Dondozo at the cost of being locked into the move, Hurricane can snag a surprise OHKO on Great Tusk and deal huge damage to Zamazenta, and Brick Break can OHKO even bulky Kingambit at +1. Dragonite can be tailored to fit nearly any offensive team; it cannot beat every Pokemon in any one set, it can choose to beat just about anything. Dragonite primarily runs Tera Normal to boost Extreme Speed into a strong STAB move, as it lacks a reliable STAB option otherwise. The boost also allows +1 Dragonite to OHKO otherwise threatening Pokemon like Weavile. Tera Normal also removes all of Dragonite's existing weaknesses, allowing it to set up on practically any Pokemon in the tier. Multiscale makes Dragonite nearly impossible to OHKO, providing it with a safe setup turn even in the face of some of the tier's strongest threats like Gholdengo and Darkrai while also making it a great revenge killer. Dragonite primarily features on bulky offense or hyper offense, where it provides defensive utility alongside threatening to sweep. In general, Dragonite's best use is against opposing offensive teams. For hyper offense, Its bulk allows it to trade for most offensive Pokemon in a pinch, and Extreme Speed picks off most fast and frail threats. It allows the team to focus less on fighting opposing offense and frees up team slots for Pokemon that match up better into bulkier styles. For bulky offense, it checks dangerous Grass- and Water-types such as Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W that can threaten frailer defensive cores while also revenge killing sweepers. Dragonite is quite weak to Garganacl, as it takes little damage from Dragonite's moves except Earthquake, which it can avoid by Terastallizing, while threatening Salt Cure and hazards, so it appreciates Pokemon like Gliscor that can heal off Salt Cure damage and force it out. Other setup sweepers sweepers like Taunt Roaring Moon can also help to overwhelm Garganacl. Primarina is a similar case, not fearing most of Dragonite's options while threating a strong STAB Moonblast or Draining Kiss in return, but it can be dealt with by teammates like Ogerpon-W and Raging Bolt. Bulkier Pokemon and teams in general give Dragonite a lot of issues, as without a high power STAB move, it cannot break though bulky neutral targets. Because of this, it appreciates Knock Off support that can force in and chip bulky Water- and Fairy-types like Dondozo and Clefable; offensive Great Tusk and Weavile both fit in this role. Dragonite benefits greatly from entry hazard setters like Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T. Dragonite should almost always be paired with a Steel- or Fire-type, as they complement Dragonite's typing well and help to deal with problematic Pokemon like Weavile and Enamorus. Kingambit provides this support while also dealing with Ghost-types like Skeledirge and Dragapult that often stop Dragonite. Tera Dark Kingambit with Black Glasses also forces progress against almost all of the physically defensive Pokemon like Corviknight that Dragonite struggles to break. Nasty Plot Gholdengo similarly offers a good defensive pivot for Dragonite while blocking hazard removal to assist with the hazard stacking that Dragonite benefits from, and it also threatens bulkier styles well with boosted STAB moves. Heatran is another excellent teammate on bulkier offense teams, as it can provide Dragonite with entry hazard support while threatening its checks such as Clefable and Skarmory, in addition to forcing out revenge killers like Weavile. Iron Valiant is also notable as it threatens out physically defensive Pokemon such as Great Tusk and provides Knock Off support. Choice Band Dragonite is a strong wallbreaker and revenge killer for offensive teams. Extreme Speed enables Dragonite to revenge kill a myriad of threatening sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after minor chip damage while doing solid neutral damage to most of the tier with the use of Tera Normal. Tera Normal Extreme Speed notably OHKOes offensive variants of Primarina after Stealth Rock and is favored to 2HKO even physically defensive Clefable. Ice Spinner OHKOes both Gliscor and fast Landorus-T, common physical answers that often switch in against Dragonite to stuff potential Dragon Dance sets. It also notably hits Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Raging Bolt without the risk of locking into Outrage. Fire Punch is the ideal fourth move, being Dragonite's highest damage option against Skarmory, Corviknight, and Air Balloon Gholdengo, all of which are always 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. Earthquake is another option, providing a safer option into certain Pokemon like Raging Bolt and being a uniquely powerful option against Heatran, but it leaves Dragonite walled by airborne Steel-types like Skarmory. An Adamant nature is chosen because Extreme Speed reduces the need for a Jolly nature and it importantly removes the need for good damage rolls against aforementioned Pokemon like Corviknight and Primarina. Tera Normal enables revenge killing with Extreme Speed while removing all of Dragonite's original weaknesses. This reduces damage from Stealth Rock and enables Dragonite to survive attacks like Dragapult's Dragon Darts and Weavile's Triple Axel. Choice Band Dragonite needs specific support to thrive. As it is weak to Stealth Rock, wants to preserve Multiscale, and does not run Heavy-Duty Boots, it appreciates entry hazard control from the likes of Great Tusk or Hatterene. Similarly, to preserve Multiscale and to find good opportunities to break, pivots are great teammates. Galarian Slowking, Landorus-T, and Primarina can all support the team defensively while using their pivot moves to safely get in Dragonite. Primarina additionally can switch into and force out threats like Dragapult, while Galarian Slowking can set up dangerous checkmate scenarios with Future Sight to limit defensive checks like Clefable and Zamazenta. Hazards greatly help to set up consistent 2HKOs and the potential for a late-game Extreme Speed sweep, so Spikes setters like Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu also fit in, as do Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Other offensive Pokemon fit best with Dragonite, with fast sweepers like Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon especially appreciating Dragonite's breaking power and defensive utility in Multiscale and priority. Gholdengo and Iron Moth are strong teammates, as they take advantage of the Fairy- and Steel-types that threaten Dragonite while keeping up offensive pressure. As the set relies on a Choice item, Protect users like Alomomola, Garganacl, and Gliscor can greatly lessen the threat that Dragonite poses. Ogerpon-W is a teammate that threatens all of them while also generally helping against the style of teams that those Pokemon find themselves on. Kingambit deserves a mention, as both it and Dragonite can wear down physical walls for each other and threaten to clean late-game with their strong priority attacks. Tinkaton is another option as a Stealth Rock setter that also helps to check opposing would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Darkrai while spreading Thunder Wave paralysis to give Dragonite more opportunities to attack freely. Utilizing Loaded Dice and Scale Shot, Dragonite speeds through OU, flying circles around traditional Dragonite checks like Corviknight, Zamazenta, and Gholdengo. Scale Shot gives Dragonite a powerful STAB move to hit many threats, OHKOing its fellow Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Raging Bolt and, after a Dragon Dance, the likes of Ogerpon-W and Darkrai. Furthermore, after a Speed boost from Scale Shot or Dragon Dance, Dragonite can outspeed almost the entirety of the unboosted metagame, excluding Dragapult, Zamazenta, and Deoxys-S, and further usage of Scale Shot can make it extremely difficult to outspeed Dragonite without priority. Fire Punch slams the Steel-types that Scale Shot misses, like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Kingambit. Finally, Encore shuts down both defensive and offensive Pokemon that dare to set up or recover on Dragonite, like Corviknight, Zamazenta, and Garganacl. Loaded Dice ensures Scale Shot is a reliable damaging move. Tera Fire boosts Fire Punch, pushing Corviknight into the 2HKO range and guaranteeing the 2HKO on Skarmory, Gholdengo, and Kingambit, and nullifies Cinderace's and Moltres's Will-O-Wisp, allowing Dragonite to turn potential checks into setup opportunities. Due to Scale Shot's Speed-boosting side effect, Dragonite can comfortably run an Adamant nature, guaranteeing the OHKO on threats like Walking Wake. With its power and versatility, Scale Shot Dragonite finds itself on bulky offense and hyper offense teams. Due to Dragonite's lack of Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard control is more important than ever to maintain both Multiscale and to avoid chip damage, so hazard control teammates like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Hatterene are crucial, with the latter also serving as a status blocker from pesky defensive Pokemon like Moltres and Gliscor. Speaking of status spreaders, Dragapult is a flight hazard for Dragonite, with a speedy Will-O-Wisp and devastating Dragon Darts, so partners like Primarina and Iron Valiant are solid picks to scare it away. An exceptional partner for Dragonite is Landorus-T, which brings hazard support in Stealth Rock, a fast Taunt that can deny Stealth Rock from setters like Glimmora and Ting Lu, and the ability to bring Dragonite in safely through U-turn. Other strong partners for Dragonite are Gholdengo and Iron Crown, as they can scare threats like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, which Dragonite often struggles to switch into; the latter also works as a pivot through Volt Switch. Similarly, Dragonite also enjoys pairing with Galarian Slowking, which threatens Iron Valiant, Primarina and other Fairy-types that halt Dragonite's attack and can also pivot with Chilly Reception. Dragonite crushes its fellow Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, as well as other physical walls like Gholdengo and Skarmory, clearing the way for teammates like Ogerpon-W to wreak havoc. Dragonite can also take advantage of Water- and Grass-types like Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, covering for defensive partners like Primarina, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk. Kingambit also appreciates Dragonite as a teammate, as Dragonite can lure in checks like Cinderace and Moltres before flipping the tables with Tera Fire, allowing for an easier late-game sweep with Kingambit."

    "name": "Dudunsparce",
    "text": "Specially defensive Dudunsparce is a good defensive Pokemon in ZU, as it has great bulk, reliable recovery in Roost, and several useful utility options. Body Slam is the STAB move of choice, as its high paralysis chance with Serene Grace makes Dudunsparce surprisingly challenging to switch into safely. Dudunsparce is a decent Stealth Rock setter thanks to its bulk giving it opportunities to set up entry hazards and its longevity enabling it to set them up again if they're removed. Dragon Tail allows Dudunsparce to phaze out foes and rack up hazard chip damage. It also prevents Dudunsparce from being setup fodder for Nasty Plot Mesprit, Mismagius, Farigiraf and Calm Mind Dudunsparce unless they Terastallize Fairy. Toxic can be used over either of these moves to let Dudunsparce spread additional status and allows it to pressure Ghost-types such as Mismagius and Oricorio-G on the switch. It is also Dudunsparce's best way to pressure very bulky foes like Articuno, Regirock, and Palossand. Tera Fairy has great synergy with Dudunsparce's Normal typing, as it gives Dudunsparce a Fighting resistance while also equipping it with a generally solid defensive typing. This notably allows it to keep Stealth Rock on the field versus the common Defog Hisuian Decidueye. On the other hand, Tera Dragon powers up Dragon Tail and grants Dudunsparce notable resistances to Water-, Electric-, and Fire-type attacks, letting it match up better into threats such as Charizard, Typhlosion, Floatzel, and Jolteon. However, Floatzel and Jolteon run coverage moves that hit Dragon-types super effectively, so it must be used with caution. This Dudunsparce set fits well onto balance teams due to its longevity as an entry hazard setter and useful defensive profile. Physically defensive teammates such as Regirock, Sandaconda, and Spiritomb appreciate Dudunsparce shoring up their lesser special bulk and can form a solid defensive core with it. These teammates take on strong physical attackers like Snorlax, Hisuian Sneasel, and Braviary for Dudunsparce. Slow offensive teammates such as Glastrier, Magneton, and Clawitzer really appreciate paralysis support as well as Dudunsparce's Dragon Tail racking up hazard damage. Spikes setters such as Qwilfish, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Sandslash are also good teammates in order to maximize Dragon Tail's utility even further. Slower late-game sweepers such as Brute Bonnet, Swords Dance Hisuian Decidueye, and Nasty Plot Mesprit also appreciate the extra chip damage and paralysis support. On the other hand, faster cleaners such as Jolteon, Grafaiai, and Sneasel appreciate Dudunsparce chipping the opponent's team with Dragon Tail and Toxic damage. Dudunsparce's Normal typing doesn't provide it with any resistances and leaves it weak to common Fighting-types such as Hisuian Decidueye, Passimian, and Hisuian Sneasel. Teammates such as Qwilfish, Palossand, and Dipplin can help out against these Fighting-types; Qwilfish deals with Hisuian Decideye and Hisuian Sneasel, while Dipplin and Palossand can help take down Passimian. A special mention also goes to Weezing, which checks all of these Fighting-types and helps to wear them down with Rocky Helmet and burns. It can also set Toxic Spikes, which Dudunsparce can help facilitate with Dragon Tail, and it absorbs attempts to poison Dudunsparce from foes such as Qwilfish and Grafaiai, as Dudunsparce is vulnerable to the status condition. Charizard also threatens Dudunsparce with a status condition, in this case burn from Will-O-Wisp, so teammates such as Naclstack and RestTalk Lanturn can help to fully cover this threat."

  "Dugtrio": {
    "name": "Dugtrio",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 6 onwards Price Range: 8-10 points Overview: With a great Speed stat, the ability to trap grounded foes, and decent Ground / Rock coverage that hits most of the metagame at least neutrally, Dugtrio is a solid revenge killer that can pick off weakened foes and remove problematic ones. Its ability Arena Trap can often force foes to sacrifice a valuable item slot for Shed Shell, and its high Speed means many foes are not fast enough to pivot out and avoid its attacks. However, Dugtrio can struggle to hit bulkier Pokemon for significant damage, and foes that avoid the trapping effect of Arena Trap can remove much of its functionality and pivot to faster teammates or strong priority users that threaten it due to its low bulk. Revenge Killer: Thanks to its Speed, Choice Band can be comfortably run to boost Dugtrio's otherwise middling Attack stat and make it a threatening revenge killer. Other damage-boosting items can also be run to bluff Choice Band and not lock it into a move. Suicide Lead: In matchups where it struggles as a revenge killer, Dugtrio can still function decently well as a suicide lead. Arena Trap can trap foes into potentially undesirable first-turn matchups, and with Focus Sash, its high Speed means it can usually set Stealth Rock and get off a damaging move or create momentum with Memento before it is KOed. Primary STAB Moves: Earthquake Setup Moves: Swords Dance, Hone Claws Utility Moves: Stealth Rock, Memento, Endeavor, Endure, Smack Down, Substitute Coverage: Stone Edge, Rock Slide, Rock Blast, Sucker Punch, Throat Chop, Foul Play, Shadow Claw Stomping Tantrum: When facing teams with Grassy Surge setters, Stomping Tantrum can be run instead of or alongside Earthquake to allow Dugtrio to still do decent damage if Grassy Terrain is up. Reversal: Reversal is notably Dugtrio's only Fighting-type move and can function similarly to Endeavor when paired with a Focus Sash or Endure. Choice Band: Choice Band is what allows Dugtrio to most effectively lock down and eliminate its teammates' checks or clean up on its own. Focus Sash: Focus Sash primarily serves as a way to get more than one move out of suicide lead Dugtrio sets, but it can also guarantee it a chance to use a setup move. Other Damage-boosting Items: Items such as Life Orb and Soft Sand can be used to give Dugtrio a damage boost without locking it into a move. Choice Scarf: Despite Dugtrio's already-great Speed, a Speed boost from Choice Scarf can allow it to outspeed foes even faster than it and fellow Speed-boosters, catching them off guard. Although its damage is cut by not running a damage-boosting item, it can still trap and remove glass cannons such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Chi-Yu. Heavy-Duty Boots: Dugtrio tends to be switched in and out a lot, as its low bulk means it rarely wants to be in front of a foe that it cannot KO. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents residual damage from entry hazards building up on it over time. Dugtrio does not need to be a Tera Captain, but if you do select it as one, it can benefit from Tera types that boost its offensive capabilities such as Tera Ground, Rock, and types that help its matchup into specific Pokemon it would like to trap and remove. Though Dugtrio is a solid revenge killer, it can often struggle to fit on drafts and should only be drafted to shore up specific weaknesses your draft has. Ground is one of the most valuable typings, and thus it often fits quite awkwardly. Even on teams where it does fit, it's often not worth bringing into matchups that lack foes Dugtrio can easily trap and remove, though at worst it can still act as a suicide lead that can set Stealth Rock and create early momentum. Wallbreakers: Wallbreakers that struggle against Steel-types such as Kyurem, Latios, and Gholdengo benefit from Dugtrio's ability to trap and remove their checks. Strong special wallbreakers in particular can force foes to invest more in Special Defense, allowing it to do its job more effectively. Cleaners / Sweepers: Similarly to wallbreakers, cleaners and sweepers that struggle against Pokemon that Dugtrio can effectively remove do well with it on their team. Pokemon weak to fast Electric-type moves like Greninja and Palafin and Pokemon that struggle to break defensive Steel-types like Raging Bolt all appreciate Dugtrio removing their checks. Knock Off Support: While Dugtrio's ability to force foes to run Shed Shell instead of a preferred item is one of its strengths, it still functions worse as a revenge killer when foes are holding it. Knock Off users like Scizor, Empoleon, and Ogerpon-W can assist it by removing Shed Shell while also acting as defensive switch-ins for it. Grass-Type Pokemon: Grass-type Pokemon resist Dugtrio's STAB moves and do not take super effective damage from any of its coverage moves while also threatening a super effective move back. Ogerpon and Shaymin fulfill this role well, but Rillaboom in particular can cut Earthquake's damage by half by setting Grassy Terrain on entry and threaten a KO back with Grassy Glide. Trapping-immune Pokemon: Ghost-types and any non-grounded Pokemon are immune to the trapping effect of Arena Trap, and thus disable a key part of Dugtrio's effectiveness. Trapping-immune Pokemon with a type that it usually wants to eliminate such as Gholdengo, Moltres, and Zapdos can fulfill their respective roles while being free to switch out to a teammate that can threaten it. Faster Threats: Dugtrio's lacking bulk and general reliance on damage-boosting items leave it vulnerable to Pokemon faster than it. This includes Pokemon like Meowscarada, Greninja, and Weavile, which outspeed and deal super effective damage to it. Priority: Similarly to faster threats, strong priority users also threaten Dugtrio due to its lacking bulk and ease of being revenge killed. Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott, Palafin, and Azumarill all have strong priority attacks that threaten an OHKO on it. Bulky Attackers: Dugtrio struggles against bulkier Pokemon in general, but ones that can hit it back are an even greater problem for it. Pokemon like Zarude, Hydrapple, and Landorus-T can easily take a hit from it and threaten an OHKO back."

  "Empoleon": {
    "name": "Empoleon",
    "text": "Empoleon is a fantastic Water-type that can fill either a defensive role with the help of its myriad utility options or an offensive role by utilizing its phenomenal coverage depending on the needs of its team. Empoleon's incredible defensive typing gives it natural resistances to the STAB moves of many of the tier's top Pokemon, including Jirachi, Slowbro, and Cyclizar, which can give it many opportunities to make progress over the course of a game. Empoleon can also utilize its offensive power to blow holes through teams, as there are few Pokemon that can safely switch into all of its attacks, especially after a Competitive boost. Empoleon is mainly held back by its low Speed that allows strong Fighting- and Electric-type wallbreakers to easily force it out and threaten the rest of its team. Furthermore, Empoleon's inability to manually boost its offenses means that special walls like Umbreon can usually tank its attacks with very little consequence. Defensive Empoleon sets particularly can suffer from four-moveslot syndrome, as it often wants to fit more utility moves than it can afford, thereby leaning it into a passive role that can be exploited by setup sweepers. Offensive Empoleon is uniquely equipped to provide teams with a strong defensive and offensive presence given its natural bulk and exceptional coverage. Its Water / Steel typing and Special Defense is valuable in a metagame with strong Choice Scarf users such as Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar threatening to use their strong STAB attacks to clean games. Surf is a reliable STAB option for Empoleon, as it hits a lot of the metagame for neutral damage. Ice Beam gives Empoleon coverage to hit Dragon- and Grass-types such as Cyclizar, Noivern, Salamence, and Amoonguss. Grass Knot hits Water-types like Basculegion-F and Slowbro while also giving it a means to damage Volcanion. Roost assures Empoleon can reliably recover throughout a game. Leftovers gives Empoleon even more longevity and offsets most entry hazard damage. Competitive is useful for getting a boost from Defog attempts, Intimidate Attack drops, and notably from Moonblast Special Attack drops, as Empoleon often switches into Fezandipiti and Gardevoir. Modest is used given Empoleon has great natural bulk without much investment, giving it more wallbreaking power without offsetting the defensive utility it has. The EV spread provided covers a few relevant defensive and offensive benchmarks. The defensive investments allow Empoleon to survive Hippowdon's Earthquake after taking Stealth Rock damage, Conkeldurr's Mach Punch after taking one layer of Spikes damage, and Salamence's Earthquake after taking one layer of Spikes damage. Offensively, Empoleon threatens to 2HKO Assault Vest Cyclizar with Ice Beam after it takes Stealth Rock damage, 2HKO Slowbro with Grass Knot, and has a favorable roll to OHKO both Hippowdon and Palossand with Surf after they take Stealth Rock damage. The Speed investment allows Empoleon to outspeed Adamant Conkeldurr. Tera Fairy flips its Fighting weakness into a resistance while also making Electric- and Ground-type attacks neutral, allowing Empoleon to stay in against Krookodile and Flygon if needed. Offensive Empoleon fits on balance and bulky offense teams, as it pivots into many of the special attackers in the tier and provides an immediate offensive response. Strong Fighting- and Ground-types like Conkeldurr, Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Mienshao appreciate Empoleon switching into Fairy- and Water-type attacks, namely from Basculegion-F and Gardevoir. Offensive Empoleon fits well on teams that can use alternative entry hazard setters like Hippowdon and Jirachi so that it can maximize its offensive presence. Defensive teammates like Levitate Galarian Weezing and Noivern can switch into to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks while removing entry hazards and pivoting. Physical setup Pokemon like Swords Dance Mienshao, Revavroom, and Terrakion benefit from Empoleon being able to take on Slowbro and other bulky Water-types. Magnet Pull Magnezone can partner with Empoleon to trap and eliminate Steel-type Pokemon like opposing Empoleon and Jirachi, two of the better defensive checks to offensive Empoleon. Salamence is an excellent teammate for Empoleon, as it can threaten to hit most of the metagame with its excellent mixed offensive attacks and provide another bulky defensive presence with reliable recovery. Sticky Web setters like Araquanid and Galvantula can partner with and enable offensive Empoleon, as it outspeeds Adamant Overqwil, Adamant Revavroom, and Jolly Bisharp after they get slowed down. Specially defensive Empoleon is among the best utility Pokemon in the metagame for its capacity to counter most special attackers, establish entry hazards, remove items, and phaze setup attempts. Roost allows Empoleon to remain healthy enough to switch in against the strong special attackers like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar multiple times throughout a game. Flip Turn can be used to gain switch momentum after switching into an attack, allowing teammates to position into whatever enters the field against Empoleon. Knock Off provides excellent utility in the form of item removal, namely Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing entry hazard damage to rack up as Empoleon forces multiple switches by absorbing attacks. Roar provides similar utility in accruing entry hazard damage while stopping setup attempts from the likes of Calm Mind Cresselia, Slowbro, and Reuniclus. Ice Beam gives Empoleon coverage to hit the Grass- and Dragon-types in the tier like Chesnaught, Cyclizar, Noivern, and Salamence. Leftovers ensures Empoleon can recover off damage taken from entry hazards and switching into special attackers. Competitive gives Empoleon a needed Special Attack boost when activated by Moonblast drops from Fezandipiti and Gardevoir, Intimidate from Krookodile and Salamence, and Defog from Galarian Weezing and Noivern, making even bulky utility sets capable of outputting good damage. Being a Defog deterrent gives Empoleon an advantage in maintaining hazards, as the notable Defog users often struggle to deal with its coverage, especially after a boost from Competitive. A Calm nature with full investment in HP and Special Defense makes Empoleon seemingly impervious to damage from special attacks. Tera Fairy flips the critical weakness to Fighting into a resistance, allowing it to not be as threatened by the likes of Chesnaught, Mienshao, Slither Wing, and Terrakion, while also flipping the Ground weakness into neutrality, making Krookodile and Flygon much less imposing. Tera Ghost similarly helps with the litany of Fighting-types prevalent in the metagame and gives Empoleon a valuable immunity to Rapid Spin attempts from the primary form of removal in Cyclizar. Empoleon is a staple on balance and bulky offense teams needing to shore up their matchups into the strong special attackers in the tier, a stalwart Steel-type that can establish entry hazards, and another form of item removal or phazing. With access to Roost, Empoleon has instant and reliable recovery, unlike other Steel-types like Jirachi and Hisuian Goodra. Choice Scarf Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Gengar pose many problems for Fighting-type breakers like Galarian Zapdos, Conkeldurr, and Mienshao, making Empoleon an excellent choice to support them through defensive switch-ins and subsequent pivots with Flip Turn. Physically defensive teammates that can absorb Fighting- and Ground-type attacks from Krookodile, Slither Wing, and Terrakion like Galarian Weezing, Amoonguss, and Chesnaught are excellent in creating cores that can cause issues for opposing teams, accumulating entry hazard damage and whittling teams down. Chesnaught benefits from Empoleon handling the main forms of removal in the metagame, such as Cyclizar with Ice Beam and Noivern and Galarian Weezing due to Competitive, forming a strong defensive pairing that can remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and rack up hazard chip. Slower teammates such as Conkeldurr and Crawdaunt that appreciate Empoleon's ability to sponge special attacks and safely pivot into them can assist in removing items and breaking teams through forcing multiple switches and hitting very hard into Empoleon checks like Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Jirachi. The combination of Water and Steel gives Empoleon favorable matchups into rain abusers like Basculegion-F and Kingdra, making physically defensive teammates like Amoonguss, Bellibolt, and Chesnaught, which also functions as a Knock Off absorber for Empoleon, valuable for their ability to switch into Barraskewda. Empoleon can gradually get worn down by hazard chip itself, making teammates that can pivot and maintain hazard control like Cyclizar and Noivern excellent partners. Flash Cannon is a STAB option that can enable Empoleon to deal with Fairy-types like Alolan Ninetales, Gardevoir, and Fezandipiti more easily. Agility can be used on offensive sets to solve Empoleon's Speed problem and enable it to act as a cleaner at the cost of Roost or a coverage move. Shuca Berry allows Empoleon to take out common Ground-type Pokemon like Krookodile and Hippowdon after safely absorbing an Earthquake. Chople Berry similarly enables Empoleon to survive a hit from wallbreakers such as Galarian Zapdos and strike back. 216 Speed EVs can be used on offensive sets to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt. Tera Water is another option on offensive Empoleon that can boost Surf enough to secure certain rolls, including an OHKO on Hippowdon and a 2HKO on Bisharp. Fighting-types: Fighting-type wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Slither Wing threaten Empoleon and force it out, which give them the opportunity to fire off an attack or pivot safely out of the switch-in. Setup Sweepers: Many of the common Calm Mind users in the tier such as Fezandipiti, Reuniclus, and Slowbro can outheal Empoleon's damage and use it as setup fodder if it isn't running Roar or the right coverage move. Because of its relative passivity, defensive Empoleon can be similarly exploited by other threatening setup sweepers such as Shift Gear Revavroom, Swords Dance Bisharp, and Dragon Dance Gyarados. Special Walls: The most specially defensive Pokemon in the tier like Hisuian Goodra and Umbreon can easily shrug off Empoleon's attacks and force progress against it or create an opportunity for a physical wallbreaker to switch in and threaten Empoleon out."

  "Enamorus": {
    "name": "Enamorus",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Enamorus can be a sweeper, a form of speed control that allows it to function as an effective revenge killer, and a support Pokemon that gives a teammate a second chance at sweeping via Healing Wish. Choice Scarf is used to outspeed faster common threats such as Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Attack Booster Energy Roaring Moon. Earth Power is mandatory coverage for hitting Fairy resistant foes: Steel-types like non-Air Balloon Gholdengo and Iron Treads, Fire-types like Heatran and Skeledirge, and Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire. Tera Stellar Tera Blast gives Enamorus a way to boost its Special Attack thanks to Contrary while simultaneously sniping opposing Terastallized Pokemon like Kingambit. Tera Stellar hits everything in the tier neutrally, so it's able to snowball and clean weakened teams effectively. Mystical Fire is a good alternative, letting it hit Steel-types immune to Earth Power, such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also making Enamorus not as Tera-reliant. Healing Wish sacrifices Enamorus in order to fully heal a chipped sweeper like Kingambit or Raging Bolt so it can continue a sweep it couldn't finish previously, and should be used when Enamorus's speed is no longer needed to win the game. Tera Ground can be used instead of Tera Stellar to power up Earth Power and to flip Enamorus's poor matchups against Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb. Tera Fairy can also be used to further boost Moonblast's power, guaranteeing 2HKOs against Ting-Lu and neutral targets like specially defensive Gliscor. Enamorus is best used as speed control on offensive teams that appreciate it giving teammates a potential second chance to sweep. Hazard removers like Court Change Cinderace and Great Tusk are excellent teammates, since Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Enamorus can come in and revenge kill. Cinderace can give hazards to the foe if they aren't on both sides of the field, its access to U-turn helps get Enamorus in safely, and its Pyro Balls force Gholdengo off the field so Enamorus can use Moonblast more freely. Great Tusk is a great teammate, because it threatens common Enamorus switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Toxapex, and checks Kingambit, which can take a hit from Enamorus and retaliate back. Galarian Slowking is a pivot that greatly appreciates Enamorus's presence since it can deal with the Dark- and Ground-types that annoy it such as Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Darkrai. Enamorus appreciates Galarian Slowking's presence too, as its access to Future Sight is extremely useful for muscling through Poison-types like Toxapex and opposing Galarian Slowking and for bulky neutral targets like Gliscor. Galarian Slowking's access to status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave allows it to incapacitate Pokemon that may give Enamorus a hard time like Iron Valiant, Walking Wake, and Iron Boulder. Chilly Reception is used to bring Enamorus onto the field safely, but also has the added benefit of changing the weather, giving rain Pokemon like Barraskewda, Raging Bolt, and Iron Treads a harder time. Another pivot Enamorus loves pairing with is Landorus-T, since it can bring Enamorus in safely with U-turn, threaten all the Poison- and Steel- types Enamorus struggles with, and can set Stealth Rock. Bulky physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Great Tusk work well with Enamorus since they're able to deal with special walls that can prevent it from making progress, mainly Galarian Slowking, and change the tide of a battle if they're able to get a second chance at sweeping thanks to Healing Wish. Physical Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon are more Pokemon who enjoy Enamorus's presence, since it can take on one of their best checks in Zamazenta, and Healing Wish can allow them to achieve a late-game sweep in case they had to come in earlier and sustain lots of damage. They're also able to blow past common Enamorus checks such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Clodsire. Hazard setters like Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott can help chip foes into range for Enamorus to break through their team, and Gholdengo is appreciated to block removal attempts and keep the hazards up for the duration of the game. Enamorus is a powerful Calm Mind sweeper and wallbreaker that is powerful enough to break through many foes. Earth Power gives Enamorus the ability to damage Galarian Slowking significantly, as well as targeting Gholdengo, Clodsire, and Heatran and OHKOing offensive Kingambit after a Calm Mind. Substitute is a great utility move, allowing Enamorus to block revenge killing attempts as well as avoid status moves, preventing Pokemon like Gliscor and Clodsire from affecting it with Toxic. Taunt is an alternative option that, as well as also blocking Toxic, can block walls like Corviknight and Clodsire from being able to recover and prevent opposing sweepers like Primarina from setting up and trying to beat it one-on-one. Leftovers provides Enamorus with a consistent recovery option, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots removes its weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Ground can be used to increase the strength of Earth Power as well as flip Enamorus's weakness to Poison-type moves like Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb to a resistance. It's also useful to immediately remove Enamorus's weakness to Electric, allowing it to block Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and defeat it with Moonblast. Tera Steel turns many of Enamorus's key move weaknesses into resistances, including Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb, Weavile and Meowscarada's Triple Axel, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, which allows it to set up a Substitute or Calm Mind and punish the aforementioned Pokemon. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Enamorus's Fairy-type STAB moves, allowing it to secure an OHKO on Zamazenta. Enamorus benefits from more offensive team structures where it can be used to support its teammates with its ability to boost up and sweep through teams. Enamorus's typing makes it extremely dangerous to Fighting-, Dragon-, and Dark-types like Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and Ting-Lu, respectively, while also turning Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T into setup fodder. This opens up teammates such as Gholdengo, Heatran, and Cinderace to play more freely with Enamorus able to threaten out their shared checks. In return, Cinderace is able to support Enamorus by providing entry hazard control in the form of Court Change. Enamorus is not particularly bulky, so it's vulnerable to Pokemon that it can't KO easily and can KO it back in turn. One of the most prominent Pokemon that fits this description is Galarian Slowking, which can take all of Enamorus's attacks and threaten it in return with Sludge Bomb. Kingambit is a great teammate to have as a switch-in to Sludge Bomb and Future Sight that can also force out Galarian Slowking. Kingambit also checks Gholdengo, which is another Pokemon that's difficult for Enamorus to deal with, as well as helping with priority from Sucker Punch, threatening faster foes like Deoxys-S and Iron Boulder. Bulkier Pokemon such as Blissey that can handle Enamorus's attacks present a problem that Enamorus can't get around on its own; having teammates like Roaring Moon, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W can therefore help in breaking through. Great Tusk can also support Enamorus with Rapid Spin as a way of getting rid of Stealth Rock if Enamorus isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots. Offensive teammates like Serperior and Gholdengo appreciate Enamorus's ability to weaken checks like Clodsire; in return, Gholdengo can help deal with Galarian Slowking and Corviknight."

    "text": "Between its amazing defensive typing, high special bulk, and great matchups against common Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult, Equilibra is one of CAP's most reliable defensive pivots and entry hazard removal options. It fits primarily on balance teams, using its powerful Doom Desire to enable teammates and force checkmate scenarios where it can guarantee damage or a KO. Equilibra makes great use of Leftovers thanks to its many immunities and resilience to hazards, as with its immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web and 4x resistance to Stealth Rock, Heavy-Duty Boots is completely unnecessary. Pain Split maximizes Equilibra's recovery, which is useful to extend its longevity against bulkier teams; however, Protect can be used instead in order to maximize recovery from Leftovers, stall Doom Desire turns, scout Choice-locked foes and foes attempting to Tera, and block checkmate attempts done with opposing Doom Desire or Future Sight at the cost of leaving Equilibra without recovery if it loses its item. Flash Cannon can be used over Doom Desire if it needs to immediately pressure foes like Iron Valiant, Air Balloon Gholdengo, Enamorus, Gliscor, Rillaboom, and Hatterene. Maximum special bulk allows Equilibra to sponge powerful STAB attacks from special wallbreakers like Dragapult, Kyurem, and Darkrai and avoid being OHKOed by Focus Blast from +2 Gholdengo. Tera Water lets Equilibra take on Water- and Fire-type moves that would otherwise threaten it, whereas Tera Dragon is an alternative that offers a better matchup against Grass- and Electric-type foes like Caribolt and Krilowatt at the cost of a less useful defensive typing as a whole. Cresceidon appreciates Equilibra's ability to take on threatening Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Chuggalong and to remove entry hazards if Cresceidon loses its Heavy-Duty Boots; in return, Cresceidon deals with strong Fighting-, Fire-, and Water-type wallbreakers that threaten Equilibra like Great Tusk, Gouging Fire, and Walking Wake. Arghonaut is another bulky Water-type that checks powerful physical wallbreakers like Zamazenta and Cinderace, can absorb Knock Off, and appreciates Equilibra checking Gliscor and keeping the field clear of hazards. Wallbreakers like Kyurem, Dragapult, and Ogerpon-W pair well with Equilibra, as the pressure it provides with Doom Desire is very valuable. Venomicon and Equilibra cover each other's weaknesess very well, as Venomicon can switch into the physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom, Hemogoblin, and Ogerpon-W that Equilibra fears, while Equilibra tanks the hits of the special wallbreakers like Stratagem and Kyurem that Venomicon can't take on. If using Equilibra on a more offensive team where longevity is less of a priority, it can run an EV spread of 252 HP / 40 SpA / 216 Spe with a Modest nature to outspeed Adamant Hemogoblin and Kingambit, and it can run moves like Healing Wish and Aura Sphere instead of Pain Split to better support its team. It can also run an EV spread of 52 HP / 52 Def / 112 SpA / 40 SpD / 52 Spe with a Modest nature if offensive prowess is preferred over Speed or raw bulk. This spread lets Equilibra avoid the OHKO from Hemogoblin's Flare Blitz and Walking Wake's Hydro Steam out of sun, lets it outspeed Skeledirge, and invests heavily in Special Attack for incredibly powerful Doom Desires. Bulletproof can be run to hard wall every Gholdengo set and, in conjunction with Tera Fairy, also wall Darkrai and Chuggalong. Bulky Flying-types: Pokemon like Venomicon, Skarmory, Moltres, Zapdos, and Corviknight can all take Equilibra's hits well and retaliate with super efective moves. Item Removal: Leftovers are essential for Equilibra if it wants to be kept healthy on a match. Knock Off from the likes of Gliscor, Arghonaut, and Clefable as well as Trick from Choice Scarf Gholdengo can make it way harder for it to stay healthy and would make it have to rely on Pain Split for healing. Bulky Water-types: Pokemon like Arghonaut, Rotom-W, Cresceidon, and Primarina can tank Equilibra's attacks then hit back with super effective STAB moves. Offensive Grass-types: Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior can sponge Equilibra's hits then strike back with their powerful STAB attacks. The former two can threaten an OHKO with Ivy Cudgel and Wood Hammer, with Ogerpon-W being an especially notable check, since it resists both of Equilibra's STAB attacks. Physical Wallbreakers: Miasmaw, Zamazenta, and Gouging Fire can all heavily damage Equilibra, as they outpace Equilibra, target its weaker Defense stat, and can hit it super effectively. Roaring Moon and Greak Tusk can also heavily damage Equilibra while having the option to use Knock Off as a neutral option to remove Equilibra's Leftovers if it stays in or any switch-in's item."

    "name": "Eternatus",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Eternatus is the premier dedicated Kyogre check in Ubers, able to tank even boosted Ice Beams and stall Kyogre out with Toxic and Recover. Additionally, its access to, and ability to absorb, Toxic Spikes give it great utility in a tier where hazard removal options are few. Eternatus can also take Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire with ease, as well as scare out the majority of Calm Mind Arceus formes. Outside of being a wall, Eternatus can pull off a threatening Meteor Beam set which works excellently on hyper offense teams, and Choice Scarf lets Eternatus be a decent revenge killer that also absorbs Toxic Spikes. It can be difficult to fit Eternatus on some teams, as it lacks the sheer role compression of Clodsire, and it stacks weaknesses with some of the most common Pokemon in the tier, Koraidon and Miraidon. Meteor Beam Eternatus can have a hard time getting past Ho-Oh once Meteor Beam is used, and Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground are a hard stop to it. Furthermore, Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C can be a huge nuisance for the defensive set, as they can shrug off most of its attacks and use it as a setup opportunity. While Toxic and Toxic Spikes may seem redundant together, Toxic is critical for dealing with Kyogre, as it often runs Heavy-Duty Boots. Toxic Spikes are a great way to pressure the opposing team, especially those lacking Poison-types or Defog users. Even against such teams, Toxic Spikes can still be advantageous when combined with smart double switching. Toxic Spikes are also one of the few ways to make progress against Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Clodsire, all of which wall Eternatus. Flamethrower can be used when combined with Koraidon's sun, as it has a 76% chance to 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM, and it can also heavily dent Zacian-C. Tera Fairy allows Eternatus to get the jump on Koraidon and Miraidon's Dragon-type attacks. Alternatively, Tera Grass provides great utility against Arceus-Ground, letting Eternatus Toxic it without worry. The given EVs let Eternatus outspeed neutral-natured max Speed Arceus formes, with the rest dumped into Special Defense and HP to better take on Kyogre. It is possible to run less Speed EVs; 212 HP / 252 SpD / 44 Spe with a Calm nature allows Eternatus to outrun positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon while providing more special bulk. Eternatus excels on balance teams that aim to win in the long-term, as its immediate damage potential is rather low. Against hyper offense structures such as Sticky Webs teams, Eternatus's Toxic Spikes can greatly limit the opposing team's sweeping potential. Critical defensive Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy, Ting-Lu, and Arceus-Water are all vulnerable to both Toxic Spikes and Kyogre, so Eternatus is a fantastic teammate with them, since it can deal with both. Defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is a highly recommended partner for checking Zacian-C and providing Knock Off support. Ho-Oh, Landorus-T, and Corviknight are good teammates for providing a Ground immunity, with Corviknight having the added bonus of Defog support. This set leverages Eternatus's great bulk, speed, power, and ease of setup to become one of the most dangerous late-game sweepers in the metagame. 88 Speed EVs allow Eternatus to outrun unboosted Jolly Rayquaza and Kyurem-B, as well as the entire metagame after a single Agility, even outspeeding +1 Koraidon. The rest of Eternatus's EVs are invested into its HP, letting it easily survive hits when setting up and avoiding an OHKO from unboosted Koraidon’s Dragon Claw. Tera Fire aids Eternatus even further in taking hits while setting up, crucially giving it Ice- and Steel-type resistances and a neutrality to Koraidon’s Dragon Claw. Tera Fire also strengthens Eternatus's Fire Blast, which, in conjunction with Koraidon’s sun and a Meteor Beam boost, can perform absurd feats like easily 2HKOing would-be checks in Clodsire and Ting-Lu, being favored to OHKO defensive Arceus-Ground, and always OHKOing Necrozma-DM, while Tera Dragon strengthens Dynamax Cannon, giving Eternatus more consistency in sweeping late-game thanks to Dynamax Cannon's perfect accuracy. Aside from giving Eternatus a much-needed power boost, Meteor Beam is great for destroying Ho-Oh, an otherwise great check, as well as hitting Tera Fire Calyrex-I super effectively, as Calyrex-I will usually Terastallize into the Fire typing to resist Fire Blast and threaten Eternatus. Fire Blast is used to hit Steel-types that wall the combination of Meteor Beam and Dynamax Cannon, most notably Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C. Sludge Bomb should only ever be used over Agility on Sticky Web teams, and even then, while it destroys Arceus-Fairy and Tera Fairy Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Kyogre, and Miraidon, it has little practical use outside of this. This set is not a perfect sweeper, however, as it cannot set up as easily as it might seem due to the prevalence of Pokemon that irritate it like Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground. Eternatus is a great choice for offensive teams that struggle with Toxic Spikes and Kyogre, as it removes Toxic Spikes and can decently check Kyogre when healthy. Koraidon makes for a good pairing with Eternatus, as it appreciates Eternatus removing Toxic Spikes and checking Kyogre and Arceus-Fairy, whereas Eternatus loves Koraidon not only threatening its checks but also for its sun, which strengthens its own Fire-type coverage. Pokemon that can overwhelm defensive Ground-types that check Eternatus, like Miraidon and Calyrex-I, are also appreciated. Entry hazard leads like Deoxys-A, Deoxys-S, and Glimmora are great for Eternatus, as the immediate chip damage is greatly helpful for a Pokemon that aims to claim OHKOs as much as it does. Eternatus is also useful when supported by Pokemon that can ward off Koraidon and Miraidon, Eternatus’s greatest nemeses. Kyogre, Arceus-Fairy, and Ting-Lu can do this decently and support Eternatus in other ways; for example, Ting-Lu can set Spikes. Choice Scarf allows Eternatus to outpace just about everything in the tier other than Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon. That allows it to get the jump on Dragon Dance-boosted Arceus, Zacian-C, and maximum Speed Dragon Dance-boosted Necrozma-DM. Eternatus has next to perfect coverage with its STAB moves and Flamethrower, allowing it to pick off almost all of the premier offensive threats from above half health or 2HKO them on the switch. Eternatus also makes excellent use of Toxic Spikes, which give it additional value against teams that don't have a way to deal with them. A Modest nature guarantees an OHKO on Miraidon with Dynamax Cannon, allows a sun- or Tera Fire-boosted Flamethrower to OHKO Zacian-C, and allows sun-boosted Tera Fire Flamethrower to OHKO Calyrex-I guaranteed and Trick Room Necrozma-DM 50% of the time. A Timid nature can be used to provide more safety against niche sets like Choice Scarf Ribombee. Fire Blast can be used instead of Flamethrower on Timid Eternatus to allow for the same OHKOs as Modest Eternatus's Flamethrower. Tera Fire is the primary Tera option, as it allows Eternatus to get the crucial KOs against Fire-weak targets. Tera Flying can be used to give Eternatus a free turn against the Arceus-Ground it's trying to revenge kill, as well as allowing it to become immune to the effect of Sticky Web. Tera Fairy can be used to revenge kill Speed-boosted Koraidon as Eternatus becomes immune to Dragon-type attacks. Unlike Miraidon and Koraidon, Eternatus doesn't have a pivoting move like U-turn, so it can sometimes sink momentum and allows foes to set up after it locks itself into an unfavorable move. That's why Eternatus appreciates a defensive core to fall back on. The defensive core also likes having Eternatus on the team, as it can allow more flexibility in checking offensive threats, especially Kyogre. Eternatus also avoids necessitating the core to have a grounded Poison-type or other means of dealing with Toxic Spikes, which can also give the team more flexibility. Ting-Lu and bulky Arceus formes are some of its best partners, as they tend to be weak to Toxic Spikes and could sometimes get overwhelmed by the offensive onslaught of hyper offense teams, the likes of which Eternatus can greatly help against. Against some Pokemon that it wants to revenge kill like a preferably chipped Zacian-C, Eternatus can make use of its excellent natural bulk and defensive typing by switching in directly on them, which can allow for the full preservation of the defensive core. This is notably something Choice Scarf Miraidon and Koraidon can't do. Leftovers can be run over Heavy-Duty Boots when provided with Defog support. Dragon Tail can be used to phaze out Tera Poison users as well as rack up Toxic Spikes damage, but it is generally not as useful as Toxic at dealing with most Kyogre and Arceus formes. Sludge Bomb is a more offensive alternative to Toxic, but relying on its 30% chance to poison can be unreliable for dealing with special threats. Cosmic Power sets can be difficult for the opposing team to deal with, as Eternatus is immune to poison and has reliable recovery. Unfortunately, these sets tend to get phazed out by Ting-Lu and Ho-Oh before accomplishing much, and are limited by Recover's 8 PP. Steel-types: Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C are the most common switch-ins to Eternatus, as they are immune to poison and can quickly become powerful offensive threats when given a chance to set up. However, neither of them like taking Flamethrower or Fire Blast, especially in the sun. Ground-types: Clodsire hard walls most Eternatus sets, taking on Dynamax Cannon and using Eternatus as an opportunity to set entry hazards. It's worth noting that Eternatus can often stall out Clodsire's Earthquake with Pressure. Additionally, offensive Eternatus is capable of blasting through Clodsire, provided it has a Special Attack boost. Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground both fear Toxic, but can threaten Eternatus back with powerful Earthquakes and Ground-type Judgment. Specially defensive Gliscor can tank Dynamax Cannon and set hazards on Eternatus. Ice-types: Chien-Pao and Calyrex-I, though neither likes directly switching in, both threaten to OHKO Eternatus and may run Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid Toxic Spikes. Tera Poison: A timely Tera Poison from Kyogre or Calm Mind Arceus formes like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground can turn the tables against Eternatus, though these Pokemon typically run another Tera type such as Fairy. Paralysis: Eternatus must be careful to avoid being paralyzed, as it makes successfully checking Kyogre much harder. Kyogre may paralyze Eternatus on the switch with Thunder Wave or fish for it with Thunder. Other Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Water, and Giratina-O commonly run Thunder Wave, so Eternatus must be careful when switching in on them. Blissey: While only seen on stall, Blissey hard walls all Eternatus sets and can heal status from its teammates with Heal Bell."

  "Excadrill": {
    "name": "Excadrill",
    "text": "When using Swords Dance, Excadrill acts as both an excellent utility Pokemon with Rapid Spin and a dangerous wallbreaker and cleaner all in one set. Rock Slide is preferred over Iron Head to let Excadrill more easily beat Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Tornadus-T; however, Iron Head allows Excadrill to break past Hydrapple and Sinistcha. Rapid Spin is used both for its ability to remove entry hazards and also the crucial Speed boost it gives that lets Excadrill outrun the unboosted metagame. Tera Dragon lets Excadrill flip weaknesses to common moves used to check it like Greninja's Surf, Azumarill's Aqua Jet, and Hisuian Arcanine's Flare Blitz, while Tera Ground gives it a strong power boost on Earthquake, letting it OHKO Slowking at +2; this also sheds its weakness to opposing Excadrill's Earthquake. Tera Electric is useful on Iron Head sets to let Excadrill beat Zapdos despite lacking coverage to hit it. These are the main choices, but Excadrill can viably run a lot of Tera types; Tera Fire lets it set up on Skeledirge, Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost give it a resistance or immunity to moves like Mienshao's Close Combat while Tera Fairy also lets it resist Mandibuzz's Foul Play, Tera Flying lets it beat opposing Excadrill more consistently, and Tera Water helps with Greninja while retaining a stronger Scizor and Mamoswine matchup. Leftovers lets Excadrill play more flexibly mid-game before it goes for a sweep, but Air Balloon lets Excadrill beat opposing Excadrill and act as a more reliable hazard remover against Spikes teams, particularly those using Sandy Shocks. Excadrill fits on just about any team you can think of thanks to its remarkable offensive capabilities and utility. Hydrapple is a huge roadblock for Excadrill, so Pokemon like Lokix, Tornadus-T, and Enamorus-T make for wonderful partners capable of pressuring it. Excadrill in return is great at supporting these Pokemon if they forgo Heavy-Duty Boots to alleviate their weakness to Stealth Rock by removing them from the field with Rapid Spin. It appreciates support from entry hazard setters like Tinkaton and Hisuian Arcanine; with the help of Knock Off users like the aforementioned Tornadus-T and Lokix, Excadrill can much more easily cleave through checks like Zapdos and Slowking. Tinkaton and Assault Vest Tornadus-T are also great pivots into Latios, which is appreciated by Excadrill because it doesn't take Draco Meteor well without bulk investment. Slowking makes for an effective partner, as it can check Latios, which Excadrill can often struggle with despite its type advantage. Excadrill has few defensive checks, but teammates like Scizor and Mamoswine that can threaten or weaken checks like Hydrapple and Zapdos are extremely appreciated. Excadrill can be revenge killed by foes like Greninja, Azumarill, and Lokix, so checks like Keldeo, Zapdos, and Rotom-W make for helpful teammates. Sand Rush Excadrill is a deadly threat, being a great sweeper, wallbreaker, and revenge killer thanks to the combination of Swords Dance and it outpacing the entire boosted metagame under sand. After a Swords Dance, Rock Slide does heavy damage to Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Tornadus-T. Rapid Spin is primarily used for the utility it brings with removing entry hazards; however, its Speed boost can potentially prevent Excadrill from being revenge killed once sand has subsided. Iron Head can be used over Rapid Spin if the team is not pressured by hazards as much, which can help it break past Hydrapple and Latios more easily. Iron Head can also be used over Rock Slide, but it should be paired with Tera Electric so Excadrill can get past Zapdos. Air Balloon provides some utility against Sandy Shocks, Rhyperior, and opposing Excadrill, but Leftovers can be used for passive recovery. Life Orb can be considered, as it notably allows Excadrill to OHKO Zapdos and Slowking after a Swords Dance boost, though it will cut into Excadrill's longevity and potentially bring it into range of priority from Lokix and Keldeo. A Jolly nature is primarily used so Excadrill can Speed tie with opposing Excadrill outside of sand. It also lets Excadrill outpace Battle Bond-activated Greninja under sand; however, it would be reliant on a defensive Tera to take Water Shuriken. An Adamant nature can be used to help improve the chances of KOing Pokemon like Slowking after a Swords Dance. Tera Rock increases the damage of Rock Slide to KO Mandibuzz and Zapdos, and the Special Defense boost under sand can help it beat foes like Hydrapple and take priority from Keldeo and Greninja better. Tera Dragon provides many useful resistances, notably letting it take priority hits from Greninja and Azumarill. Tera Ground provides a boost to Earthquake, allowing Excadrill to OHKO Slowking at +2 and remove its weakness to opposing Excadrill's Earthquake. Other Tera options are also great on Excadrill such as Fairy to beat Mandibuzz reliably and Fire to have a better matchup against Skeledirge. Excadrill fits best on offensive teams that can break down defensive structures to help Excadrill sweep more easily. Sand is essential, so Tyranitar or Hippowdon are mandatory partners, both being able to set Stealth Rock to help potentially bring foes into KO range. Tyranitar can help check and pressure Mandibuzz and Zapdos for Excadrill as well as force damage on other common answers like Keldeo. Alternatively, Hippowdon offers a sturdy check to opposing Excadrill and can afford to run Smooth Rock more easily due to having reliable recovery in Slack Off. Lokix can revenge kill Excadrill with minor chip damage, so a partner like Zapdos or Cobalion can keep it in check; the latter can run Stealth Rock to allow Excadrill's partner Tyranitar to run a more offensive set. Azumarill is easily one of the deadliest threats to sand teams, so Pokemon like Volcanion, Rotom-W, and the aforementioned Zapdos are excellent teammates, all also having favorable matchups into rain teams. Rotom-W is a huge roadblock for Excadrill, so it is essential to run partners that can overwhelm it like Latios and Keldeo. Keldeo in particular can force in Excadrill answers like Latios, Hydrapple, and Sinistcha and heavily dent, or in Hydrapple's case OHKO, them with Icy Wind. Hydrapple is another partner that can pressure Rotom-W but also deals with other Pokemon like Slowking, Ogerpon, and Zarude for Excadrill. Mandibuzz can help pivot into Ogerpon and opposing Excadrill as well as provide Defog support, freeing up Excadrill to run Iron Head over Rapid Spin. Excadrill can be a useful lead on hyper offense teams thanks to its ability to enable threats like Ogerpon-C and Greninja that enjoy entry hazards being removed while providing some facet of removal against Sticky Web teams. Excadrill compresses Stealth Rock as a lead and can get it up by forcing out Pokemon such as Metagross, Rotom-W, and Tyranitar. Rock Tomb can slow down Pokemon attempting to set up against Excadrill like Zarude and Thundurus-T as well as general offensive leads like Tornadus-T and Ogerpon. Steel Beam is an alternative so Excadrill can KO itself to deny Mandibuzz and opposing Excadrill from removing its entry hazards, but Excadrill still offers some useful traits like checking Latios and Comfey that make it worth not KOing itself. Focus Sash guarantees that Excadrill can get off at least one attack, often choosing to use Rapid Spin into Stealth Rock into attacking. While Excadrill should not be Terastallized under most common circumstances, as the mechanic is better utilized by a sweeper on the hyper offense team, Tera Ghost can be used in an emergency to block Rapid Spin from opposing Excadrill to guarantee Stealth Rock remains up. Lead Excadrill is exclusively relegated to hyper offense teams as a lead that enables many sweepers to perform effectively. Quaquaval and Ogerpon-C are two of the best sweepers of the archetype, the latter benefitting from Excadrill keeping off Stealth Rock, and they are able to take advantage of threats Excadrill gives entry to such as Keldeo, Slowking, and Zapdos. Mimikyu can block Rapid Spin from opposing Excadrill, allowing Tera to be preserved, and utilizes the entry hazards to take out foes like Tinkaton more easily while providing very valuable defensive utility against Lokix, Latios, and Greninja. Greninja appreciates entry hazard chip damage wearing down Tornadus-T and can offensively check foes like Slowking, Cobalion, and Hydrapple. Threatening sweepers like Comfey and Okidogi are able to set up on and pressure Mandibuzz and Lokix, not to mention they can use Tera themselves to now take out other threats like Metagross and Tinkaton for the former and Zapdos and Excadrill for the latter. Bisharp similarly can punish Mandibuzz attempting to use Defog with Defiant and take advantage of Stealth Rock chip damage to clean with Sucker Punch, while Azumarill takes advantage of Pokemon that lead Excadrill invites in such as Hydrapple, Quaquaval, and Hippowdon while liking hazards up to break Ogerpon-C's Sturdy."

  "Falinks": {
    "name": "Falinks",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Falinks's strategy is notably one-note, being the sole Pokemon with access to the powerful omniboosting move No Retreat. However, its mediocre stats and lack of reliable recovery struggle to support what could've been a powerful niche, leaving it in the position as a late pick for a draft that doesn't need much more than an additional Pokemon threatening a sweep. Even after boosting, Falinks can still struggle to sweep, making it hard for it to pull its weight. There isn't much it can do other than commit to a sweep, so it will bring no major utility to a draft. Omniboost Sweeper: While only possible once a game, No Retreat can give Falinks decent stats, and, with investment, it can outspeed and threaten many unboosted foes. However, weak defenses before a boost can make it more difficult for Falinks to boost without losing a large percentage of its health. Wallbreaker: With a Choice Band, Falinks can do serious damage to foes expecting a setup sweeper. First Impression with a Choice Band boost can eliminate faster threats, with other powerful moves dealing significant damage without locking into never switching out. Primary STAB Moves: Close Combat, Body Press Setup Moves: No Retreat, Iron Defense, Trailblaze Utility Moves: Rest, Knock Off, Sleep Talk, Substitute Coverage: High Horsepower, Iron Head, Poison Jab, Rock Slide, Zen Headbutt, Body Slam, Megahorn, Lunge, First Impression Facade: While Falinks should not be statusing itself, if the opposing team is expected to respond to the threat of Falinks with a burn, Facade provides it a powerful attack that can allow a sweep to continue on despite the status. Endeavor: A boosted Falinks is able to take a few hits before being knocked out, so Endeavor can be an option to quickly bring down a Pokemon's health in cases where the default STAB move options are less effective. Throat Chop: Throat Chop prevents a number of dangerous moves, such as Roar and Parting Shot, from ruining Falinks's strategy. It also prevents Pokemon like Hatterene and Sylveon from using sound-based attacks like Psychic Noise and Hyper Voice. Bulk Up and Swords Dance: Should Falinks want the flexibility of switching out, it has access to other Attack-boosting moves that don't involve the commitment of No Retreat, such as Swords Dance and Bulk Up. Upper Hand: Falinks can avoid an interrupted sweep with Upper Hand, preventing priority moves from KOing it at low health. Sitrus Berry: Sitrus Berry greatly increases how long Falinks can function as a sweeper by increasing its functional HP pool by 25% in most circumstances. However, sufficient Defense drops from Close Combat can result in Sitrus Berry not getting a chance to activate, as Falinks gets KOed from beyond its range. Lum Berry: With how essential it is for Falinks to remain free of status, Lum Berry can allow it to ignore Toxic Spikes or push through a single turn of a status-inducing move like Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. Heavy-Duty Boots: Falinks needs to wait for an opportunity to set up, increasing the chance that entry hazards will chip it when it comes in. With only so much damage it can take and no reliable recovery, Heavy-Duty Boots protect Falinks from being chipped simply by entering the field. Choice Band: Falinks can be a decent wallbreaker with Choice Band, hitting hard while circumventing the standard responses to it. Choice Band also allows it to leave and return to the battle multiple times during a game, having impact throughout. Pairing Choice Band with First Impression also allows Falinks to act as a surprise revenge killer. Resistance Berries: Without needing to commit Terastallization to Falinks, a held Payapa, Coba, or Roseli Berry can enable Falinks to survive certain super effective hits in order to set up and begin to sweep. Mental Herb: Without boosted Speed before No Retreat, Falinks can suffer from Taunt preventing it from setting up at all. Mental Herb can give Falinks the turn it needs to set up, after which it has little worry of being Taunted. Choice Scarf: In a similar approach to the Choice Band, Falinks can patch up a low Speed stat by using a Choice Scarf. Falinks's cheap cost can allow for pairing with an expensive Tera Captain while also maintaining a niche use as one itself. While Falinks will struggle to make as much use out of Tera as most Pokemon, Tera is not completely wasted on it either. Defensive types like Steel and Poison can allow Falinks to avoid the types that hit it for super effective damage, enabling it to take a resisted hit and set up No Retreat. Tera Fighting can also work as another damage boost for its main damaging moves once No Retreat is set up, though it offers no benefit to enabling setup opportunities. Tera Bug can increase the damage of First Impression to secure needed KOs. Falinks is a garnish on top of a nearly completed draft, adding little in the way of defense or utility but providing a cheap source of minor teambuilder pressure. Falinks should only be considered as a gimmicky option for a draft with one or two points left to spend and little need when it comes to standard roles. Entry Hazard Setters: Falinks greatly appreciates the chip damage that comes from entry hazards, such as Garchomp's Stealth Rock and Greninja's Spikes. Toxic Spikes is less impactful when Falinks is hoping to KO Pokemon outright, but Sticky Web can help Falinks outspeed certain threats before setting up. Entry Hazard Removal: The ability to run an item other than Heavy-Duty Boots without risking Falinks's HP is something that Corviknight, Iron Treads, or Brambleghast can provide by removing entry hazards with Defog or Rapid Spin. Slow Pivots: Slow pivots like Galarian Slowking and Rotom-W allow Falinks to switch in safely, ensuring that Falinks gets in unscathed. If running a Berry like Sitrus Berry, this allows Falinks to keep its item intact. It also prevents double switches, ensuring that Falinks only enters the field against something it can comfortably use No Retreat against. Phazing: If a Pokemon can stomach a hit from a boosted Falinks, holding a Red Card or using a move like Whirlwind will force Falinks out. With Falinks pressed to find good setup opportunities in general, forcing it out can provide a near complete stop to its ability to sweep. Haze can blank any No Retreat boosts without giving Falinks another opportunity to set up later in the game. Status: Falinks struggles to accomplish a sweep when statused, with each status providing its own flavor of limitation. Sleep and burn are the two most detrimental, each potentially ending Falinks's run outright. Revenge Killers: Even when boosted, there are a number of threats that Falinks can't outrun if they have their own way of increasing their Speed, like Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users. Pokemon like Choice Scarf Annihilape, Speed Booster Iron Valiant. and Unburden-activated Sneasler can outrun and OHKO a damaged Falinks."

    "text": "Despite its mediocre offensive stats, Fezandipiti leverages its excellent bulk, good defensive typing, and signature Toxic Chain ability to be a threatening late-game cleaner while also serving as a solid part of its team's defensive backbone. Fezandipiti's 4x resistance to Fighting makes it an excellent answer to Pokemon like Mienshao and Slither Wing, and its immunity to Dragon and great Special Defense make it a great switch-in to Salamence and Noivern, all of which it can take advantage of to set up Calm Mind or fire off its Toxic-spreading attacks. Fezandipiti does have several weaknesses to common types in the tier, however, like the Ground-type Hippowdon and Swampert and the Psychic-type Gardevoir and Armarouge, all of which are able to survive a Moonblast and threaten Fezandipiti back with super effective attacks. There are many Calm Mind users that Fezandipiti can thrive against such as Suicune and Raikou, but Covert Cloak Slowbro and Magic Guard Reuniclus can reliably win the matchup unless Fezandipiti Terastallizes into an advantageous type and uses Taunt to prevent them from boosting. Roost is used to keep Fezandipiti's HP high while it sets up. U-turn allows Fezandipiti to pivot out of unfavorable matchups while potentially applying Toxic thanks to its ability. Taunt is used to prevent opposing Pokemon from using their own setup or healing moves, taking advantage of Fezandipiti's Speed to act first and deny its foe the chance to move. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Fezandipiti from being worn down by entry hazards, improving its longevity. Covert Cloak is primarily used to protect Fezandipiti from Jirachi's Iron Head flinches and Body Slam paralysis as well as Psychic Noise from Slowbro and Reuniclus after Terastallizing, but it also appreciates the effect on moves such as Gardevoir's Moonblast and Salamence's Hurricane. With a Timid nature and 200 Speed EVs, Fezandipiti is fast enough to outspeed Krookodile, which threatens it with strong STAB Earthquake but is vulnerable to Fezandipiti's Moonblast. Terastallizing into the Water-type turns Fezandipiti's Steel weakness into a resistance, allowing it to better take on foes like Jirachi, Hisuian Goodra, and Bisharp, and its lack of weaknesses allows Fezandipiti to survive most neutral hits from other threats. Tera Fairy removes Fezandipiti's Ground and Psychic weaknesses, giving it better matchups against Pokemon like Hippowdon and Reuniclus, while maintaining its important resistances to Fighting and Dark so it can still to switch into Close Combat and Knock Off from Pokemon like Mienshao, Slither Wing, and Crawdaunt. The damage boost from Tera Fairy also guarantees that Moonblast can OHKO Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, and Terrakion after one Calm Mind. Fezandipiti fits best on balance or bulky offense teams that can chip its checks down across the game and enable a sweep. Knock Off from Cyclizar, Mienshao, and Galarian Zapdos can remove Leftovers from Jirachi and Empoleon to make the lower damage of Fezandipiti's attacks more meaningful as well as Covert Cloak from Slowbro, allowing Toxic Chain to affect it. Fezandipiti benefits from a VoltTurn core with teammates like Cyclizar, Slither Wing, and Magnezone, and it can join in if running U-turn. Magnet Pull Magnezone is a useful teammate, capable of forcing damage onto Steel-types like Bisharp and Jirachi that Fezandipiti can struggle to break through, and U-turn pivoting can ensure Magnezone is able to attack these targets. Fezandipiti works best with teammates that can take the super effective Ground-, Psychic-, and Steel-type attacks that threaten it, such as Noivern, Slowbro, and Empoleon. The Pokemon that want to switch in against Fezandipiti are often vulnerable to Spikes, as Jirachi and Hisuian Goodra lack reliable recovery and typically run items other than Heavy-Duty Boots, so setters such as Chesnaught, Klefki, and Quagsire are valuable. Heat Wave allows Fezandipiti to hit the Steel-types that typically wall it for super effective damage, reducing its reliance on teammates to answer them. Nasty Plot boosts Fezandipiti's Special Attack faster than Calm Mind, making it a more immediate threat with maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs as well as Heat Wave. Fezandipiti has other options for Tera types, such as Steel, which allows it to resist Terrakion's Stone Edge and Gardevoir's Psychic. Tera Electric grants Fezandipiti resistances to Hisuian Goodra's Flash Cannon and Galarian Zapdos's Brave Bird while also making it immune to the paralysis inflicted by Jirachi and Reuniclus. Fezandipiti also has the option to drop Calm Mind and run more bulk to take a utility role with moves such as Toxic, which is more reliable than Toxic Chain, and Alluring Voice, which is weaker than Moonblast but can punish faster setup sweepers. Steel-types: Steel-types like Empoleon, Magnezone, and Revavroom resist Moonblast, are immune to being poisoned, and can threaten Fezandipiti with super effective STAB moves. Poison-types: Poison-types like Amoonguss and Tentacruel resist Moonblast, cannot be poisoned, and can use disruptive moves like Clear Smog and Haze to remove Fezandipiti's boosts. Galarian Slowbro can use Psyshock to get around Fezandipiti's Calm Mind boosts. Fast Physical Attackers: Physical threats like Terrakion and Galarian Zapdos as well as Choice Scarf users like Krookodile and Terrakion can outspeed Fezandipiti and deal significant damage to it or KO if it is not healthy enough. Jirachi: Jirachi in particular is a threat to Fezandipiti due to a combination of its Steel typing, good stats, and variety of disruptive tools. Flinches from super effective Iron Head, paralysis from Body Slam and Thunder Wave, Psychic Noise, Encore, and Trick can all stop an unprepared Fezandipiti in its tracks. Calm Mind Jirachi also beats non-Taunt Fezandipiti, and Doom Desire and Future Sight can prevent a safe entry."

  "Flareon": {
    "name": "Flareon",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Flareon is a terribly misguided physical wallbreaker due to its weakness to entry hazards, low Speed, reliance on chipping itself down with Toxic and recoil damage, and lack of any real coverage moves, often relegating it to its would-be secondary role of a specially bulky Fire-type. As a special wall, it can mend its vulnerability to hazards and chip damage with Heavy-Duty Boots and Wish, respectively, but it still suffers from a lack of physical coverage moves and a weak Defense stat. Special Wall: With serviceable utility moves of the likes of Will-O-Wisp and Wish as well as a respectable Special Defense stat that is unfortunately hindered by its typing and HP stat, Flareon can act as a special wall to certain Pokemon such as Gholdengo, non-Tera Iron Moth, and Tornadus-T. Wallbreaker: Boasting a high base Attack with access to Guts means that even Pokemon that resist Fire have a tough time switching into Flareon. However, having to hold a Toxic Orb in order to reliably activate Guts means it struggles to get much value out of it due to its lack of physical coverage and being incredibly easily to revenge kill. Primary STAB Moves: Flare Blitz, Lava Plume, Fire Blast, Flamethrower, Overheat, Temper Flare Setup Moves: Calm Mind, Curse, Trailblaze Utility Moves: Roar, Wish, Will-O-Wisp, Yawn, Protect Coverage: Facade, Alluring Voice, Scorching Sands, Shadow Ball, Double Kick, Bite Fire Spin: Although it traps Flareon with the foe, Fire Spin can be used to get chip damage on bulkier targets. Dig: Flareon's desperation for coverage moves truly runs deep, and Dig + Power Herb may be useful in catching a Rock-type off guard. Quick Attack: Quick Attack on Guts sets can prove useful in either revenge killing or picking off weakened foes. Heavy-Duty Boots: Due to Flareon's debilitating weakness to entry hazards, Heavy-Duty Boots is an absolute must on bulkier sets, allowing it to repeatedly attempt to get Wish to its teammates, even with its low base HP. Toxic Orb: The only way Flareon has to activate its own Guts is with Toxic Orb. The residual damage from the Toxic poison status will rarely matter, as Guts sets severely lack longevity. Power Herb: Flareon's feeble flings in farming damage draws it to dark depths; Dig is its only way of touching Rock-types on the physical side outside of Trailblaze, but it is often better off running a special set with Scorching Sands if the goal is to hit a Rock-type. Silk Scarf: If Flareon is expected to get poisoned by its foes, Silk Scarf is ideal on Guts sets to boost Facade and Quick Attack, alleviating some of the pressure it has to click Flare Blitz and taking recoil damage. Leftovers: If entry hazards are not as much of a concern in a match, Leftovers provides additional healing on Wish + Protect sets. Flame Orb: On sets designed specifically to Terastallize, Flame Orb is an option to deal less damage than Toxic Orb would, but not every Flareon should be designed to Terastallize. Eject Pack: With an Eject Pack, Flareon can use Overheat to get a big hit off and get a teammate in safely. It has the ability to pass a Wish this way as well. Flareon is a usable secondary Tera Captain when paired with a higher-tier Tera Captain if none of the other low-point Pokemon on a draft benefit from Terastallization. On offensive sets, Tera Norma boosts the moves it usually wants to use on Guts sets, and it can also use Tera types that give it additional coverage options with Tera Blast, such as Tera Electric to hit bulky Water-types and Tera Ground to hit Rock- and Steel-types while having Facade to hit everything else. On defensive sets, Tera types that can take advantage of Flash Fire, such as Tera Steel and Grass, are standout choices. Flareon should not come to every matchup, and it should be drafted on a team that functions fine without it. When it comes, it needs a lot of support, as it either lacks a way to put out substantial amounts of damage or longevity depending on its set. It can use Wish to heal up Pokemon that lack reliable means of recovery, but with no way to safely pivot to its teammates, this can be risky. Drafting Flareon on a team that appreciates an immunity to Fire would be best, taking advantage of Flash Fire. Pokemon That Resist Fire: Since it lacks a way to hit Pokemon with strong moves outside of its Fire-type moves, practically any Pokemon that resists Fire moves has an easy time checking Flareon. Physical Walls: Physical walls that are not weak to Fire-type moves such as Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Garchomp can all switch into the Guts Flareon set easily and force it out, although they all don't appreciate getting burned from Will-O-Wisp. Residual Damage: On Guts sets, residual damage can be Flareon's biggest killer, especially considering that its best physical Fire-type move damages itself. Physical Attackers: Flareon's low physical bulk leaves it extremely vulnerable to physical attackers, even ones that can only hit it for neutral damage."

  "Florges": {
    "name": "Florges",
    "text": "Florges is one of PU's best Choice Scarf users thanks to its high Special Attack stat, strong and spammable STAB move, Trick, and decent bulk for a revenge killer. Synthesis allows Florges to recover health against Pokemon it forces out such as Bombirdier, Wo-Chien, and Altaria; however, it is risky if Florges has not given away its Choice Scarf with Trick. Calm Mind makes Florges become a setup sweeper after using Trick to give away its Choice Scarf. Tera Blast should be used with Tera Groundto hit Pokemon that otherwise wall it such as Galarian Slowbro and Coalossal while also providing defensive utility against Pokemon like Skuntank. Psychic is a decent mid-ground against Poison-types such as Salazzle and Toxtricity and comes with the benefit of targeting these two without Terastallizing. Finally, Wish gives Florges utility by allowing it to help heal its teammates' HP. Tera Fairy boosts Moonblast to incredible amounts of power, allowing Florges to 2HKO Bellibolt and OHKO Kilowattrel. Florges can either opt for an EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe or use a more bulky EV spread of 252 HP / 24 Def / 232 Spe, which allows it to have enough Speed to outpace Jolteon and Adamant Bombirdier as well as Skuntank after Trick, and it can pass bigger Wishes to its teammates. Finally, Tera Poison is a purely defensive Tera type that allows Florges to take attacks from Pokemon like Salazzle, Decidueye, and Duraludon. Choice Scarf Florges finds itself mostly on offense and balance teams looking for a reliable form of speed control that can disrupt balance teams thanks to Trick. Florges's unqiue trait of good bulk while still retaining great offensive pressure makes it a more specialized Choice Scarf user than other choices such as Hoopa and Flamigo. Florges can't reliably break though Steel- and Poison-types such as Bronzong, Galarian Slowbro, and Copperajah without Terastallizing, so Pokemon that can take these threats on like Zoroark, Mudsdale, and Paldean Tauros-F all make good partners. Florges's ability to revenge kill Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W and Zoroark allows slower wallbreakers that struggle with these faster threats such as Golurk, Rotom-H, and Decidueye to be more potent attackers. Since it can't run Heavy-Duty Boots and will likely switch in often, Florges appreciates entry hazard control from Pokemon like Altaria, Coalossal, and Tastugiri so it can become more threatening. In turn, Florges removes their checks such as Ambipom and Bombirdier. Florges finds itself used over other Calm Mind sweepers like Scream Tail and is one of PU's best bulky setup sweepers thanks to its great defensive typing, wide range of utility options, reliable recovery, and immunity to Dragon Tail. Florges has a wide variety of options for its third moveslot; Psychic Noise is coverage for Poison-types like Salazzle when Florges would want to avoid Terastallizing, and it also prevents Specially Defensive walls like Gastrodon and Wish Scream Tail from attempting to stall out Florges with their recovery. Tera Blast should be paired with Tera Ground, which allows Florges to break through Poison- and Fire-types like Galarian Slowbro, Coalossal, and Arcanine. Finally, Wish allows Florges to provide support for its team and gives it extra PP for recovery to pair with Synthesis; it is primarily used as a wall rather than a primary win condition, although it comes at the cost of not having coverage. The given EV spread allows Florges to obtain as much physical bulk as possible while also outspeeding Adamant Golurk as well as opposing walls such as Wo-Chien and Milotic. When not running Tera Blast, Tera Poison is ideal for a strong defensive typing, allowing Florges to set up against Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Bellibolt. Tera Ground should be paired with Tera Blast, and although it provides a worse defensive typing, it allows Florges to set up against Pokemon like Salazzle as well as Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Delphox. Florges is most commonly used on bulky balance teams looking for a secondary wincon that, when teamed with a primary wincon like Arcanine and Decidueye, can also function as a special wall or a Wish passer if need be. Even with investment, Florges's physical bulk is not good enough to set up against physical attackers like Paldean Tauros-F and Scyther, so physical walls like Bellibolt, Mudsdale, and Altaria make excellent partners. Likewise, in order for Florges to attempt a sweep without Tera Blast Ground, Fire- and Steel-types like Arcanine, Delphox, and Alolan Sandslash must be chipped or KOed, which can be achieved by Pokemon like Golurk, Bruxish, and Rotom-H. In return, Florges can soft check and threaten out their offensive checks like Zoroark and Goodra. Florges's ability to soft check and threaten Dark- and Fighting-types like Grimmsnarl, Zoroark, Scrafty, and Hariyama makes the likes of Galarian Slowbro, Galarian Articuno, and one's own Scrafty amazing partners. In return, these three can defensively or offensively check some of Florges's own checks like an opposing Galarian Slowbro and Bronzong. If Florges opts for Wish, the ability to pass Wish is extremely beneficial to offensive partners like Staraptor and Decidueye, which chip away at opposing walls like Milotic and Gastrodon that can phaze out Florges, allowing Florges to sweep; Wish is also beneficial for partner walls lacking reliable recovery like Mudsdale, Houndstone, and Gligar. Florges is one of PU's best Wish passers thanks to its incredible special bulk, high Special Attack even without investment, and great defensive typing, allowing it to take on threats such as Scrafty, Wo-Chien, and Flamigo. Synthesis gives Florges reliable recovery, although Protect synergizes well with Wish and allows Florges to scout out attacks from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Staraptor and Flamigo. Psychic Noise lets Florges disrupt walls such as Gastrodon and Bellibolt by preventing them from recovering while also being a decent coverage option against Poison-types such as Salazzle and Toxtricity. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Florges to ignore entry hazards, although Leftovers is an option to give small amounts of recovery that can be helpful in tandem with Protect. The given EV spread allows Florges to outspeed Wo-Chien and Milotic while investing as much into Defense as possible to take advantage of its valuable resistances to Fighting and Dark. Tera Poison grants Florges a resistance to Grass- and Poison-type attacks from Pokemon like Rotom-C, Salazzle, and Skuntank. Florges finds itself on bulky balance teams that like its ability to Wish pass while also being a great mixed wall. Walls lacking recovery like Gligar, Mudsdale, and Bronzong appreciate Florges's ability to keep them healthy throughout the game. Florges can struggle with Poison- and Steel-type Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Skuntank, and Copperajah, which it can't Wish pass safely against, so Pokemon that can check these threats and also benefit from Florges's Wish passing capabilities such as Golurk, Mudsdale, and Arcanine make good partners. Florges's ability to check Pokemon like Scrafty and Kilowattrel makes it an excellent partner for Pokemon that struggle against these threats, such as Decidueye and Zoroark. Even though it resists Fighting-type attacks, Florges still appreciates other Fighting-resistant teammates like Galarian Slowbro and Altaria to not be its team's sole switch-in to them.The latter also takes advantage of setup sweepers Florges can't handle on its own, like Decidueye."

  "Flutter Mane": {
    "name": "Flutter Mane",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Flutter Mane carves itself a niche as one of the most threatening wallbreakers in Ubers thanks to its incredibly powerful STAB combination, near-unrivaled Speed that is boosted further under sun, good coverage options, and great defensive typing, allowing it to operate as a solid revenge killer against Pokemon like Extreme Killer Arceus. Its Ghost / Fairy typing allows it to target a variety of threats, particularly the big three Pokemon in the tier—Miraidon, Koraidon, and Necrozma-DM— as well as Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Extreme Killer Arceus. However, Flutter Mane struggles to find opportunities to switch in safely thanks to its mediocre physical bulk and vulnerability to entry hazards. Likewise, some special walls like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Water can take an attack and potentially threaten to status Flutter Mane or flat out KO it. Psyshock is Flutter Mane's best option against Clodsire and Eternatus. Alternatively, Mystical Fire can be used, being Flutter Mane's best option against Pokemon like Zacian-C and being boosted under sun. Power Gem is extremely valuable coverage, allowing it to OHKO offensive and defensive Ho-Oh after a bit of chip. Tera Fairy boosts Moonblast, allowing Flutter Mane to hit damage thresholds like 2HKOing Calm Mind Kyogre and Ting-Lu after a slight amount of chip while giving it a useful resistance to Dark-type attacks like Chien-Pao and Kingambit's Sucker Punch, although it removes its immunity to Extreme Speed. Tera Stellar is an option, giving Flutter Mane a one-time boost to any of its attacks, allowing it to outright OHKO any Ho-Oh variant while still retaining its valuable immunity to Extreme Speed. However, it is worthless after Flutter Mane uses a move, as that move will then not be boosted for the rest of the game. When using Flutter Mane, Koraidon is a near-obligatory partner; Koraidon sets up sun, which enables Protosynthesis, as well as pivoting Flutter Mane into Pokemon it can beat like Landorus-T, opposing Koraidon, and Necrozma-DM. Other pivots like Miraidon and Landorus-T give Flutter Mane a safe opportunity to come into the field and wallbreak safely. Offensive Pokemon like Extreme Killer Arceus, Deoxys-A, and Kyogre all appreciate Flutter Mane wearing down their checks like Necrozma-DM and Miraidon. Physical attackers like Zacian-C, Groudon, and Ho-Oh make it difficult for Flutter Mane to come in safely and wallbreak; Pokemon that can take on these threats like one's own Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Water all make good partners. Spikes support from Clodsire and Ting-Lu can give Flutter Mane extra support and chip Arceus into the range of Tera Fairy-boosted Moonblast. Flutter Mane has a terrible matchup against Sticky Web teams, as it has terrible bulk and is forced to gain a Special Attack boost from Protosynthesis when affected by Sticky Web, so partners like Extreme Killer Arceus and Calyrex-I can ease the matchup. Flutter Mane covers the Fairy-type teamslot on teams, giving them flexibility with picking an Arceus forme and Tera types. This set takes advantage of Flutter Mane's great strength and coverage to become a fearsome wallbreaker. Power Gem lets Flutter Mane destroy Ho-Oh, an otherwise perfect counter to Flutter Mane, but has very little practical use otherwise. Calm Mind lets Flutter Mane reliably break through defensive Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy for the benefit of teammates like Koraidon and Miraidon. Psyshock hits Clodsire and Eternatus, while Mystical Fire hits Zacian-C, but both have little practical use beyond hitting their intended targets. Tera Fairy is the preferred Tera type with Calm Mind. Tera Stellar is preferred when not running Calm Mind, as Flutter Mane's coverage moves can struggle to OHKO their intended targets. For example, Ho-Oh and Zacian-C can normally survive Power Gem and Mystical Fire, respectively, from full HP. However, with Tera Stellar, Flutter Mane's coverage moves are favored to OHKO these Pokemon. Tera Stellar is also useful for boosting Moonblast's power while keeping Flutter Mane's immunity to Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus, allowing Flutter Mane to pick it off from higher HP. Choice Scarf Koraidon is Flutter Mane's best friend, as Koraidon provides Flutter Mane with sun and pivot support. Koraidon also appreciates Flutter Mane threatening Koraidon's checks for it, like Landorus-T and Ho-Oh. Another good partner is Miraidon, which can work with Flutter Mane to overwhelm shared checks such as Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy. Spikes support from Gliscor and Ting-Lu are generally good for wallbreakers like Flutter Mane, but Flutter Mane in particular enjoys Spikes weakening its checks, as it's not easy to revenge kill courtesy of its impressive Speed and good defensive typing. Thus, Spikes allows Flutter Mane to continue being threatening even against fast-paced offensive teams, especially as its low bulk makes it somewhat difficult to safely get on the field; it can also be forced out by Pokemon like Zacian-C if not carrying Mystical Fire. Entry hazard control in the form of Giratina-O's Defog is also an option to increase Flutter Mane's longevity, as otherwise Flutter Mane gets worn down very quickly by entry hazards and Life Orb recoil."

  "Flygon": {
    "name": "Flygon",
    "text": "Flygon's great set versatility makes it an elite Pokemon and one of the best Ground-types in NU. Choice Scarf Flygon fits on many teams, outspeeding and limiting many wallbreakers such as non-Choice Scarf Mienshao and Munkidori. Choice Band gives Flygon an incredibly spammable Earthquake and makes it a lot harder to switch into. Flygon can also pivot out with U-turn, allowing it to maintain offensive pressure and momentum. Dragon Dance Flygon can use Loaded Dice, which makes it a great late-game sweeper, and it also threatens lead entry hazard setters like Galvantula and Smeargle. However, as a Choice Scarf user, it faces competition from Mienshao and Infernape, both of which are faster than it and can revenge kill it with Close Combat. Additionally, Flygon's average Attack stat leaves it struggling when facing physical walls like Vaporeon, Vileplume, and Avalugg, as they can still take its attacks even after a Dragon Dance boost. Choice Scarf Flygon can be very easy to play around due to both of its STAB options having common immunities and resistances. Outrage is one of Flygon's strongest STAB attacks for late-game cleaning, and it can 2HKO foes like Tsareena and Kilowattrel on a switch. Dragon Claw is a safer option to avoid getting locked into Outrage, but it's significantly weaker and is harder to revenge kill foes with. U-turn allows Flygon to maintain momentum and provide free switches to teammates. Flygon's last move is commonly Stone Edge, which allows it to hit Flying-types like Talonflame, Kilowattrel, and Oricorio-E. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows it to set entry hazards for its teammates. Flygon can run Dragon Claw alongside Outrage so that it can still revenge kill foes like Kilowattrel and Tsareena without getting immediately destroyed by Fairy-types. First Impression can be used over Stone Edge, allowing Flygon to revenge kill weakened boosted and faster threats like Drednaw and Choice Scarf Munkidori. Tera Steel gives Flygon a resistance to Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon like Sylveon, Florges, and opposing Flygon. This also allows it to check some special wallbreakers like Meloetta, Dragalge, and Porygon-Z. Wallbreakers like Chandelure, Mienshao, and Breloom appreciate Choice Scarf Flygon for giving them free entry with U-turn. Flygon can form a VoltTurn core with special attackers like Kilowattrel, Rotom-C, and Toxtricity. They can threaten physical walls like Vaporeon, Avalugg, and Vileplume; in return, Flygon can pressure special walls like Alolan Muk and Copperajah. Choice Scarf Flygon struggles to break past bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Quagsire, which tank its attacks and punish it with Scald, Knock Off, a slow Flip Turn, and Toxic. Grass-types like Brambleghast, Brute Bonnet, and Vileplume similarly appreciate Flygon's U-turn giving them free entry to handle the aforementioned bulky Water-types. Steel-types like Copperajah, Registeel, and Bronzong appreciate Flygon for checking Fire-types like Chandelure, Infernape, and Incineroar; in return, they can check Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Diancie. Choice Scarf Flygon appreciates entry hazard support from Copperajah, Diancie, and Swampert, as it can wear down foes to help with Choice Scarf Flygon's low damage output. Choice Band gives Flygon more immediate power, allowing it to always 2HKO Vileplume and Quagsire after Spikes damage with Earthquake. Outrage is still an option to allow Flygon to 2HKO Vaporeon and Quagsire, but Scale Shot is preferred so Flygon isn't easily revenge killed by Fairy-types, and it makes Flygon harder to revenge kill overall. First Impression revenge kills weakened foes like Porygon-Z, Munkidori, and Torterra. Alternatively, Throat Chop provides coverage for Bronzong and shuts down Hyper Voice Sylveon, whereas Stone Edge pops Talonflame on the switch. Tera Bug gives First Impression a power boost, allowing Flygon to KO Mew and do major damage to defensive Reuniclus. Tera Steel can sometimes be preferred over Tera Bug, since it's better defensively and allows Flygon to pivot without getting chipped heavily by Stealth Rock. Choice Band Flygon likes having entry hazard support from teammates like Klefki, Copperajah, and Diancie to wear down foes that can repeatedly switch into it. Many Pokemon that tend to struggle against bulky Water-types like Vaporeon and Milotic, such as Registeel, Infernape, and Basculegion, appreciate Choice Band Flygon's ability to 2HKO them on the switch. However, while it can 2HKO most bulky Water-types, it can't always beat them one-on-one, so it pairs well with Grass-types like Tsareena, Brambleghast, and Vileplume. Physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg, Weezing, and Orthworm can take Flygon's attacks with ease, so it pairs best with Pokemon like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Chandelure that can handle these physical walls. Future Sight Galarian Articuno can be a great partner for Choice Band Flygon, allowing it to weaken physical walls like Milotic, Avalugg, and Vileplume. Dragon Dance with a Scale Shot boost allows Flygon to outspeed the entire tier, including common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Infernape. Dropping Scale Shot for Outrage is acceptable to run a different item, but this makes Flygon significantly more reliant on obtaining multiple Dragon Dance boosts to avoid being revenge killed. Substitute allows Flygon to take advantage of switches and passive Pokemon, giving it more turns to set up. With Tera Steel, Flygon can also exploit Pokemon like Vileplume and Brave Bird Talonflame for easier setup. Fire Punch allows Flygon to hit Grass-types like Tsareena, Vileplume, and Brute Bonnet, as well as Steel-types like Bronzong, Orthworm, and Tera Steel Flygon. Alternatively, Throat Chop lets Flygon target Bronzong, and it blocks Sylveon from using Hyper Voice. Tera Steel allows it to be immune to Umbreon and Quagsire's Toxic. Tera Fire gives Fire Punch a much-needed power boost and retains the resistance to Fairy-type attacks that Tera Steel gives. If running Substitute, an alternate EV spread of 32 HP / 224 Atk / 252 Spe can be run to avoid Tera Steel Flygon's Substitute from being broken by Talonflame's Brave Bird. Dragon Dance Flygon appreciates entry hazard support from Klefki and Swampert to guarantee a 2HKO on Pokemon like Vileplume and Vaporeon. Toxic Spikes in particular is helpful, since it makes it a lot easier to break through physical walls like Quagsire and Swampert that would usually tank many hits from a Dragon Dance boost. Flygon is a perfect pick for hyper offense teams due to its Sticky Web immunity and because it can sweep opposing hyper offense teams. It can also punish lead hazard setters like Galvantula and Smeargle by setting up a Dragon Dance and breaking their Focus Sashes with Scale Shot. Other sweepers like Breloom, Drednaw, and Mienshao appreciate Dragon Dance Flygon's ability to weaken teams so they can win late-game. Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Infernape can force Flygon to switch out even if it's at +1 because they can still outspeed it. Thus, slow pivots like Toxtricity, Swampert, and Flip Turn Vaporeon can help by bringing Flygon in safely. Flygon can run a mixed set with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast, allowing it to hit physically defensive Pokemon like Avalugg, Orthworm, and Vileplume. It can also run a Choice Specs set with Tera Normal, which gives it a powerful Boomburst. However, both of these sets are not common due to Flygon's low Special Attack. Flygon can also run a utility set with Stealth Rock / Earthquake / Dragon Tail / U-turn with a bulkier EV spread. This set allows it to set entry hazards for its teammates and check foes like Copperajah, Iron Thorns, and Infernape. Sadly, Flygon lacks any recovery, making it very easy for it to get worn down by chip damage. Fairy-types: Sylveon and Florges are able to tank hits from Choice Scarf Flygon and KO it back with their STAB Fairy-type attacks; however, neither of them can handle Choice Band sets, and they are complete setup fodder against Tera Steel Dragon Dance Flygon. Physically Defensive Pokemon: Physically defensive Pokemon such as Avalugg and Vileplume have enough bulk to win against any of Flygon's sets, but Vileplume has to be careful directly switching into +1 Flygon if entry hazards are present. Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Quagsire are bulky enough to tank a boosted attack and threaten Flygon back with status and Knock Off. Priority Users and Faster Attackers: Infernape, Breloom, Brute Bonnet, and Basculegion can revenge kill Flygon after it has been weakened a bit. Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Infernape can outspeed even Choice Scarf Flygon and destroy it with Close Combat."

    "text": "The combination of its good typing, amazing ability, and Spore makes Foongus an excellent defensive pivot that checks many common offensive staples like Mienfoo, Snivy, and Hisuian Voltorb and fits on most balance teams. Spore prevents foes like Timburr and Pawniard from setting up against Foongus. Tera Ghost prevents Foongus from being trapped by Gothita, while Tera Water enables it to survive Fire-type moves from foes like Hisuian Growlithe and Magby. However, after using Tera, Foongus loses its good matchup against Fighting-, Grass- and Electric-types. Teammates like Pawniard, Hisuian Growlithe, and Tinkatink appreciate Foongus checking Mienfoo for them and can in return take care of Vullaby for it. Dark-types like Vullaby and Stunky can take advantage of Gothita trying to trap Foongus. Foongus struggles against Fire-types such as Hisuian Growlithe. Hence, Mudbray and Chinchou also pair well with Foongus, since they're both good switch-ins to Hisuian Growlithe and Vullaby while benefiting from Foongus checking Grass-types like Snivy and Hisuian Voltorb."

  "Galvantula": {
    "name": "Galvantula",
    "text": "By setting up Sticky Web, Galvantula can enable wallbreakers like Torterra, Indeedee-M, and Paldean Tauros-W that are otherwise easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Inteleon, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Choice Scarf Hisuian Typhlosion. Galvantula also spreads paralysis quite easily with both Thunder and Thunder Wave. Galvantula, however, can be outsped and KOed by Pokemon with multi-hit moves like Scale Shot Flygon and Triple Axel Mienshao. Notably, Tsareena, one of the best hazard removers the tier has to offer, can use Rapid Spin to clear Sticky Web and then proceed to outspeed and KO Galvantula with Triple Axel or Knock Off the next turn. Another hurdle for Galvantula to overcome is Magic Bounce Espeon, as it always survives one hit from Galvantula as it switches in and can get severe damage off on it before bringing in a revenge killer to finish it off. Sticky Web lets Galvantula enable potent slower setup sweepers like Flygon, Toxtricity, and Porygon-Z. Thunder + Compound Eyes allows Galvantula to hit as hard as possible with great accuracy. It can also spread paralysis to bulkier Pokemon like Dragalge and Registeel that can freely come in otherwise. Thunder Wave can reliably paralyze Flying-types and Pokemon with Levitate that are unaffected by Sticky Web like Talonflame and Cresselia. Tera Ghost on Galvantula is only used in niche situations where forcing Sticky Web to be up by spinblocking Pokemon like Tsareena, Avalugg, and Brambleghast is necessary or there is no strong need to Terastallize another teammate. Setup sweepers that are relatively slow, like Porygon-Z, Chandelure, and Indeedee-M, greatly appreciate foes suffering the Speed drop from Galvantula's Sticky Web. Other setup sweepers that are still outsped even after they boost their Speed like Torterra and Dragon Dance Flygon work magnificently with Galvantula. Galvantula's Sticky Web also tends to get cleared by Tsareena's Rapid Spin and Talonflame's Defog, so spinblockers and Defog deterrents like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, Kilowattrel, and Galarian Articuno help to dissuade these entry hazard removers. The former two can also run Choice Scarf so that the team has speed control in case Sticky Web is removed. Opposing Choice Scarf users can be difficult to deal with because Pokemon on Sticky Web teams tend to be relatively slow, meaning naturally fast Pokemon like Inteleon, Infernape, and Flygon can work to counteract this issue. Hazards are also quite annoying for Sticky Web teams, especially opposing Sticky Web. Thus, Tsareena can work well as both an offensive threat and a hazard remover. Another hazard remover that works on Sticky Web teams is Focus Sash Brambleghast, as it can also set up Spikes and dent defensive Pokemon with Curse. Lunge or Pounce can be used to simultaneously ease setup for Galvantula's partners and prevent it from being taken advantage of as easily. Volt Switch can also be run to circumvent Galvantula's passivity by letting it pivot, and it can save Sticky Web for later if the hazard is removed. Energy Ball can be run to hit Pokemon like Diancie and specially defensive Swampert, but dropping Thunder Wave makes Galvantula quite passive overall. Swarm can be used over Compound Eyes with Thunderbolt replacing Thunder, as Galvantula can then OHKO Espeon with Bug Buzz after being knocked into Swarm range by Psychic. Infestation can be used to trap slower Pokemon, preventing any needless predictions to cover an opponent's switch to Magic Bounce Espeon. Entry Hazard Control: Due to Galvantula almost always being a lead, it can be easily countered by entry hazard control. Specifically, Magic Bounce Espeon, Taunt Iron Thorns, Defog Talonflame, and Rapid Spin Tsareena can all thwart hazard setting attempts by Galvantula and KO it without difficulty. Multi-hit Moves: Some Pokemon carry Focus Sash-breaking multi-hit moves like Tsareena and Mienshao, which can run Triple Axel, and certain setup sweepers like Cinccino, Torterra, and Flygon, which typically run Tail Slap, Rock Blast, and Scale Shot, respectively. Ground-types: Flygon and Torterra can easily boost in front of Galvantula, as they are not OHKOed and can KO Galvantula the next turn with their multi-hit moves. Since Energy Ball is quite rare on Galvantula, Diancie, Quagsire, and specially defensive Swampert can take advantage of it as well by setting their own hazards."

  "Garchomp": {
    "name": "Garchomp",
    "text": "Swords Dance Garchomp serves as a fearsome wallbreaker and effective Stealth Rock setter, capable of blowing past common defensive staples such as Toxapex, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Zapdos with its combination of Earthquake and a coverage option in Outrage or Stone Edge, in tandem with their respective Z-Crystal. Garchomp's positive matchup versus the latter three in turn allow it to set and maintain Stealth Rock very well. Additionally, Garchomp’s solid natural bulk and good typing lets it find opportunities to set up on Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, and Iron Moth. Outrage with Dragonium Z gives Garchomp a stronger option that can notably OHKO Landorus-T at +1 while also OHKOing Great Tusk and Zapdos at +2. However, the Z-Move can require prediction if the opponent has a Fairy-type lest Garchomp become trapped into Outrage and easily revenge killed by foes such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant. In comparison, Stone Edge bolstered by Rockium Z provides a more consistent attack for Garchomp outside of its Z-Move while hitting foes such as Skarmory, Celesteela, and Corviknight harder than its Dragon-type Z-Move counterpart. Offensive teammates who can exploit the wallbreaking capabilities of Garchomp such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Dragonite are appreciated, while teammates such as Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Ferrothorn give Garchomp a solid option to fall back on in the face of revenge killers such as Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele. Tank Garchomp maximizes the value of its ability and great movepool to check Hisuian Samurott, Mega Lopunny, and Iron Boulder. Garchomp aims to punish physical attackers and force progression with entry hazards and Toxic. Dragon Tail lets Garchomp make the most of entry hazards laid by itself or teammates, being able to force foes to take damage at random if they lack Heavy-Duty Boots. Additionally, it can also be used to deny setup sweepers like Ogerpon-W, Iron Boulder, and Dragon Dance Gouging Fire lacking a Dragon-type STAB move. Garchomp can effectively lay both Stealth Rock and Spikes due to a positive matchup versus common hazard removal options such as Zapdos and Rotom-W while also dissuading Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin, as it will take serious chip damage from Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. Toxic is another way to avoid passivity; it can be used to wear down foes such as Landorus-T, Alomomola, Zapdos, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Tera Ghost is best used for deny Rapid Spin or to change its typing to survive other wise super effective hits such as Mega Diancie's Moonblast and Mega Medicham's Ice Punch. 56 Speed EVs are enough to outrun Modest Heatran. Mega Tyranitar is a solid partner, being able to remove Landorus-T and Great Tusk's Leftovers with Knock Off, which allows Garchomp to wear them down more easily with Toxic and Rough Skin in tandem with Rocky Helmet. Mega Tyranitar can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Alomomola and certain variants of Great Tusk, letting Garchomp's entry hazards rack up more damage. Garchomp really appreciates Alomomola’s Wish passing because it lacks a source of recovery. Garchomp's matchups against other Defoggers such as Corviknight, Gliscor, and Tornadus-T make it hard to keep hazards up at times, so teammates that can help with these Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos are appreciated alongside it. Galarian Slowking proves very useful to Garchomp because of its ability to check common Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant, which usually force out Garchomp. Galarian Slowking also invites in many Pokémon that can give Garchomp an opportunity to get up Spikes such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Iron Boulder. Garchomp is a decent setup sweeper that can use the combination of Loaded Dice and Scale Shot to boost and deal damage at the same time. Fire Fang hits Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight, OHKOing the first two at +2. Tera Steel grants it the ability to ignore Toxic and set up on passive foes like Alomomola and Galarian Slowking, while Tera Fire gives Fire Fang a STAB boost and allows Garchomp to become immune to burn from foes like Rotom-W and Moltres. Both Tera types flip the match up against Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele, both of which can heavily threaten hyper offense teams which Loaded Dice Garchomp mostly finds itself on. Teammates like Volcarona, Raging Bolt, and Urshifu-R appreciate Garchomp threatening foes like Dragonite, Clodsire and Toxapex. Garchomp requires support to set up and sweep due to its typing and Defense drops from Scale Shot, so it is very helpful to have dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl. It also struggles against common threats like Tapu Lele, Iron Valiant, and Weavile, which makes Mega Scizor and Iron Valiant good partners with it. Landorus-T can pivot around Garchomp pretty easily, which makes Mega Scizor a good teammate since it can frequently force Landorus-T in and wear it down. Unaware users like Dondozo can completely shut down Garchomp, so it benefits a lot from immediate breaking power from teammates like Raging Bolt and Tapu Lele, the latter of which can also protect it from priority moves. With an astonishingly high Attack stat and access to Swords Dance, Mega Garchomp serves as a decent wallbreaker that is capable of breaking common defensive staples and setting up in front of the likes of Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Zapdos. Scale Shot lets it break Dragonite's Multiscale as well as Substitute from the likes of Kyurem and Serperior, and it can patch up its mediocre base Speed and outspeed them at +1. Fire Fang hits Skarmory and Corviknight and also OHKOes Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn at +2. Mega Garchomp appreciates teammates like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Landorus-T, since they can pivot and give it safe entry into foes like Toxapex and Heatran and let it take advantage of the switches it forces in order to set up Swords Dance. Dual screens support from Tapu Koko and Grimmsnarl gives it opportunities to set up. Fairy-type Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Tapu Lele appreciate Mega Garchomp's ability to lure and weaken Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight. Teammates like Alomomola, Galarian Slowking, and Volcarona can cover Garchomp's Ice and Fairy weaknesses from foes like Weavile and Iron Valiant. Physical walls like Dondozo and Landorus-T make it difficult for Mega Garchomp to sweep, so physical wallbreakers such as Ogerpon-W, Hawlucha, and Iron Boulder are good teammates. Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain prevents priority attacks that try to stop Mega Garchomp from sweeping, such as Weavile's Ice Shard and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out. Additionally, Tapu Koko prevents Dondozo from using Rest, as it summons Electric Terrain. Offensive teammates such as Choice Scarf Kartana and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele can check foes that try to revenge kill Mega Garchomp like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Urshifu-R, and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. Mega Garchomp is a great wallbreaker due to its enormous Attack stat, allowing it to invest its EVs almost entirely into Special Attack, luring checks like Landorus-T and Corviknight expecting the Swords Dance set. Draco Meteor allows Mega Garchomp to hit physically bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Fire-type coverage is important to hit Steel-types that don‘t mind Earthquake, such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Flamethrower used instead of Fire Blast for the increased accuracy in exchange for power. The fourth moveslot can be either Spikes or Stealth Rock to capitalize on the switches it forces, chipping down threats into range of its attacks while also threatening common hazard removers like Rotom-W and Landorus-T. Hidden Power Ice can also be used to heavily damage Gliscor after luring it. A Hasty nature helps Mega Garchomp take hits from Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, while Naive aids against Mega Tyranitar and Gouging Fire lacking a Dragon-type move. Mega Garchomp fits best on offensive teams that appreciate an early-game wallbreaker that can also set up hazards on switches it forces against Pokemon like Heatran and Galarian Slowking. Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Volcarona appreciate the hazards, chipping opponents into range of their attacks; they also appreciate its ability to take out specially bulky Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn. Ogerpon-W and Weavile also appreciate Mega Garchonp’s ability to threaten Pokemon like Raging Bolt and Ferrothorn, while it appreciates these teammates forcing Terastillization on Alomomola and Zapdos. Although Mega Garchomp is strong physically and specially, it’s still walled by Pokemon like Alomomola, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, making Kartana and Heatran are good partners, as they can both deal with these checks and allow Mega Garchomp to wallbreak for them. Mega Garchomp’s lack of Speed allows faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Weavile, and Mega Diancie to threaten an OHKO and force it out, so Pokemon that can deal with them such as Iron Crown, Ferrothorn, and Volcarona are appreciated. Mega Garchomp also can’t really wallbreak common Tera types from Pokemon such as Garganacl, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, so Pokemon that can account for these such as Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Weavile are appreciated."

  "Garganacl": {
    "name": "Garganacl",
    "text": "Garganacl's incredible defensive stats and access to Salt Cure make it a potent Curse user, letting it beat threatening physical attackers such as Weavile and Dragon Dance Dragonite while acting as a pseudo-sweeper. Earthquake lets Garganacl hit threats such as Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Galarian Slowking, with its high-Base Power giving Garganacl offensive presence so it doesn't have to rely solely on Salt Cure for damage, which is especially useful since Raging Bolt commonly runs Leftovers and Galarian Slowking's Regenerator can mitigate Salt Cure damage as well. 52 Defense EVs lets Garganacl survive Ogerpon-W's Power Whip as well as +1 Protosynthesis-boosted Roaring Moon's Earthquake without the need for Curse boosts or Terastallization. Tera Water turns Garganacl's Water weakness into a resistance, letting it better handle Water-types such as Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. It also lets Garganacl check offensive Steel-types such as Gholdengo, with Purifying Salt letting it resist Shadow Ball. On the other hand, Tera Fairy gives Garganacl an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult as well as Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt, in addition to giving it a resistance to Knock Off from the likes of Roaring Moon. It also grants Garganacl a resistance to Fighting-type moves from Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Great Tusk and removes its Grass weakness, improving its matchup against Meowscarada. Both options remove Garganacl's weakness to Ground-type moves, letting it better handle Dragon-types that rely on Earthquake for coverage such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon. Garganacl fits well on bulky offense or balance teams. Due to not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Garganacl appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Great Tusk and Corviknight; Great Tusk in particular appreciates Garganacl checking spinblockers such as Dragapult and, with Tera Water, Gholdengo. Rillaboom makes for a great partner thanks to Garganacl appreciating the recovery from Grassy Terrain, which alleviates entry hazard chip damage, as well as the reduction in Earthquake's damage, letting it check Pokemon like Roaring Moon better. It should be noted that Garganacl's own Earthquake will deal less damage as a result of Grassy Terrain and Salt Cure's chip damage will be mitigated by Grassy Terrain's healing when combined with Leftovers, however. As Substitute blocks Salt Cure, Pokemon that can punish the use of the move, such as Encore Dragonite, Infiltrator Dragapult, and Whirlwind Ting-Lu, are appreciated teammates. Ogerpon-W makes for a great partner with Garganacl thanks to Water Absorb and its ability to force Ground-types like Gliscor out with Ivy Cudgel. It can also punish Substitute with Encore and remove items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, accentuating the chip damage done by Salt Cure. In exchange, it appreciates Garganacl deterring defensive Pokemon like Skarmory with Salt Cure, as well as its ability to handle Dragon-types like Dragonite and Dragapult. Unaware Clefable forms a good defensive core with Garganacl, denying other setup sweepers the opportunity to set up on Garganacl while also appreciating its ability to absorb status from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult and Skeledirge. Garganacl also benefits from Clefable's ability to check Ting-Lu. Opposing Clefable can check Garganacl with both of its abilities, so Pokemon that can dispatch it, like Gholdengo and Heatran, make for good partners. Garganacl also enjoys Knock Off and hazard support, as the removal of items like Heavy-Duty Boots and the additional chip from hazards makes it harder to play around due to the chip damage from Salt Cure having more of an impact on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Ting-Lu. Gliscor has access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off while also resisting Ground-type moves; in exchange, Garganacl checks Hex Dragapult, one of Gliscor's best checks. Finally, specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Clodsire appreciate Garganacl's physical walling capabilities while making up for its inability to consistently handle special attackers like Primarina and Enamorus. Garganacl is an exceptional Stealth Rock setter and wall thanks to its great bulk, amazing ability in Purifying Salt, and access to Salt Cure. As a setter, Garganacl is very good at outlasting and pressuring common removal options like non-Leftovers Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Iron Treads with Salt Cure. Protect also stalls turns, which works well in conjunction with Salt Cure and allows Garganacl to chip its foes as much as possible; it's also useful at scouting moves from foes such as Choice Band Roaring Moon, Rillaboom, and Meowscarada and maximizing passive recovery from Leftovers. 52 Defense EVs allow Garganacl to survive Ogerpon-W's Power Whip and +1 Protosynthesis Roaring Moon's Earthquake, and the rest of the EVs are invested in HP and Special Defense to maximize its special bulk to help it take on threats such as Dragapult in a better fashion. Tera Fairy enables it to handle threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and Dragapult better; in addition, the Grass neutrality helps it against foes like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Meowscarada. Tera Water helps it against foes like Gholdengo and Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Both of these Tera types are useful at handling non-Swords Dance Gliscor as well, as Garganacl also acts as a Toxic absorber. Garganacl fits well on bulky offense and balance teams that need a bulky entry hazard setter; Salt Cure is great at making progress for its teammates to capitalize on. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo appreciate Garganacl's ability to chip and force damage on the opposing team with Stealth Rock and Salt Cure, especially against threats such as Skarmory and Primarina. In return, they offensively pressure Garganacl's switch-ins such as Galarian Slowking, Rillaboom, and Clefable, as it's reliant on Salt Cure for damage and is thus very passive. Gholdengo also deserves a special mention because of its ability to block hazard removal attempts from foes like Great Tusk and Corviknight. Garganacl also forms amazing cores with Spikes setters such as Gliscor, Hisuian Samurott, and Skarmory, further helping its offensive teammates by dominating the hazard game. Moreover, Gliscor and Skarmory also help it in checking Ground- and Fighting-types like Landorus-T and Zamazenta. Knock Off users such as Clefable and the aforementioned Weavile are also good teammates due to removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Galarian Slowking and Dondozo; removing Leftovers from foes like Zamazenta and Ting-Lu is also useful so that they take maximum damage from Salt Cure and Stealth Rock. In addition, Clefable and the aforementioned Gliscor also support Garganacl by acting as Knock Off absorbers, as Garganacl likes to keep its Leftovers intact—Protect and Leftovers form a strong combination that makes Garganacl very tough to break down. Galarian Slowking also makes a great partner that supports Garganacl with Future Sight, punishing Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, as well as providing pivoting support with Chilly Reception. Garganacl also appreciates hazard removal support, as its foes such as Gliscor, Clefable, and Ting-Lu may use it as fodder for setting up hazards, especially Spikes; as such, Pokemon like Great Tusk make nice teammates. Due to its relatively poor base typing, Garganacl is weak to a variety of threats including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-W; thus, partners such as Ogerpon-W, Skeledirge, Zamazenta, and Dragapult, respectively, are appreciated. Rillaboom also synergizes well with Garganacl, as its Grassy Terrain can weaken Earthquake from foes like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor for Garganacl as well as helping it deal with Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Barraskewda; in return, Garganacl supports Rillaboom with hazard and deals with foes like Iron Moth for it."

  "Gastrodon": {
    "name": "Gastrodon",
    "text": "Sample set. Stay tuned for updates! Gastrodon's great typing, ability, and utility movepool allow it to fit on many teamstyles from stall to balance, checking threats like Tatsugiri and Rotom-H. Ice Beam in tandem with Earth Power provodes near-unresisted coverage with only Rotom-H and Levitate Bronzong able to switch into this combination of moves, and it also hits common switch-ins to Earth Power like Rotom-C, Decidueye, and Staraptor super effectively. Clear Smog, however, works best on bulkier teams, as it both stops Gastrodon from being setup fodder and lets it check setup sweepers that these teams struggle with such as Bulk Up Scrafty, Calm Mind Florges, and Curse Arcanine. Surf targets Rotom-H, which Gastrodon walls but has issues with taking out, gives it a useful secondary STAB move and hits Flying-types neutrally. Gastrodon usually runs Stealth Rock is usually ran, but if a team already has a Stealth Rock user like Bronzong, Bombirdier, or Coalossal, Spikes could be used instead so it can help out its team entry hazard-wise no matter what. Leftovers prevents Gastrodon from having to heal as often, while Heavy-Duty Boots alleviates pressure from entry hazards during switches. Storm Drain allows Gastrodon to wall Water-type wallbreakers like Tatsugiri and also stop Qwilfish from pivoting with Flip Turn. Sticky Hold can be used on more defensive teams that require a Knock Off switch-in. Tera Poison helps Gastrodon check Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W, Hariyama, and Heracross while also turning its 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks into a resistance, letting it take hits from Rotom-C and Decidueye in a pinch. Tera Fairy also helps Gastrodon versus the aforementioned Fighting-types, gifting it a more well-rounded defensive typing that allows it to check Scrafty, Zoroark, and Scyther better. While Gastrodon is a strong specially defensive wall, its Defense is lacking. In order to patch up this issue, Gastrodon pairs well with Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Altaria, as they can handle Staraptor, Flamigo, Paldean Tauros-W, and Hariyama more reliably. Gastrodon consistently checks Fire-, Poison-, and Steel-type Pokemon like Rotom-H, Skuntank, and Duraludon, so Pokemon that can benefit from this like Rotom-C, Flamigo, and Choice Specs Florges make for great teammates. Grass-types like Hisuian Electrode, Decidueye, and Rotom-C easily threaten Gastrodon; therefore, it should have partners like Arcanine, Paldean Tauros-F, and Rotom-H that can scare out these foes. In turn, Gastrodon handles threatening Water-types like Tatsugiri and Kingdra amazingly. With entry hazard support from Gastrodon, wallbreakers like Toxtricity, Zoroark, and Emboar break through their checks like Bronzong, Wo-Chien, and Milotic more effectively. Gastrodon also tends to drain momentum, so to circumvent this, partners like Rotom-H, Scyther, and Flamigo can check common switch-ins to Gastrodon like Rotom-C and Wo-Chien and also pivot to regain momentum."

  "Gengar": {
    "name": "Gengar",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Gengar is one of the fastest Pokemon in RU, leaving speed demons like Cyclizar and Barraskewda as well as Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Gardevoir in the dust. Ghost / Poison is an excellent offensive typing that can hit most of the metagame for at least neutral damage, only resisted by Krookodile, Bisharp, Overqwil, and Hisuian Zoroark. Choice Scarf Gengar functions as a revenge killer against Pokemon without priority like Basculegion-F, Armarouge, and slower Choice Scarf users such as Jirachi and Krookodile. Trick gives Gengar a way to incapacitate both setup sweepers like Salamence and Blastoise that it doesn't have the power to reliably OHKO and walls like Hisuian Goodra and Gastrodon that can easily switch into one of Gengar's attacks. Gengar can lean into its utility options, setting Toxic Spikes for more entry hazard-focused teams. Focus Blast allows Gengar to threaten Steel-types like Bisharp, Empoleon, and non-Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra. It can use Thunder Wave as speed control to allow a slower sweeper like Armarouge or Weakness Policy Basculegion-F to outspeed foes. Destiny Bond can be used as a last resort to stop sweepers or when Gengar is weakened and simply needs to trade one-for-one. Tera Ghost boosts Gengar's Shadow Ball and lets it function as a cleaner against teams that are chipped down, notably OHKOing physically defensive Slowbro and having a chance to OHKO maximum HP Jirachi after Stealth Rock damage. Additionally, it removes Gengar's weaknesses to Ground and Psychic, allowing it to survive Psychic-type attacks from Reuniclus or Earthquake from Hippowdon and Salamence. Tera Dark allows Gengar to live a Sucker Punch from even a +2 Bisharp and OHKO it with Focus Blast and turns Gengar's weaknesses to Psychic, Dark, and Ghost into resistances. This lets it switch into Choice-locked Psychic-type attacks from Gardevoir and Armarouge and the strong Psychic-type STAB attacks of Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Necrozma without worry. Tera Dark also allows Gengar to win the mirror match by resisting Shadow Ball and OHKOing back with its own Shadow Ball. Gengar can fit on a wide variety of team structures, from offense to balance, due to its ability to revenge kill, shut down walls like Hisuian Goodra and Empoleon with Trick, use Toxic Spikes to spread hazards, and leverage Thunder Wave to slow down opposing revenge killers like Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos. Gengar is a great addition to hazard stack teams with its ability to leverage hazard chip to meet damage thresholds like OHKOing Hisuian Goodra with Focus Blast after three layers of Spikes and shut down Defog users like Galarian Weezing with Trick. Teammates like Suicune and Armarouge love Gengar's ability to use Trick on special walls and give them its Choice Scarf, letting them set up for late-game sweeps. Cyclizar makes an excellent teammate for Gengar, as it is able to keep the field clear of hazards for it while pivoting into Gengar to absorb pesky Fighting- and Fairy-type moves that threaten the little bike lizard. Strong priority users like Slither Wing and Conkeldurr can threaten Pokemon like Bisharp and Lycanroc-D, switching into their priority attacks while threatening them back with their own priority attacks. Slither Wing and Conkeldurr can also threaten the Steel-types that switch in when Gengar locks into Sludge Wave. Defensively, Gengar loves having a Dark-type that can resist the Dark-, Ghost-, and Psychic-type moves that threaten it, making Pokemon like Krookodile and Umbreon enticing choices. Krookodile can set up Stealth Rock for Gengar to take advantage of, while Umbreon can keep it healthy with Wish and cripple walls with Toxic. Knock Off absorbers like Rocky Helmet Chesnaught and Hippowdon can switch in to prevent Gengar from being heavily damaged and losing its item. Noivern can lure in Pokemon looking to hit it with a strong Moonblast, then U-turn into Gengar, which resists the move. It can also threaten their common checks, Steel-types, with Flamethrower."

    "text": "Thanks to its ability Good as Gold and excellent defensive typing that lets it set up on Pokemon like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable, Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a premier wallbreaker in SV OU. While Recover gives Gholdengo a way to stay in the battle for longer and leverage its defensive utility against the aforementioned threats, it also has a range of coverage moves to give it more options for wallbreaking. Psyshock is useful for breaking through special walls that would otherwise give Gholdengo trouble, like Blissey and Clodsire, and Focus Blast hits the many Dark-types in the tier, such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Kingambit. Recover is generally used on bulkier teams, whereas Psyshock and Focus Blast are more useful for teams leaning towards offense. The Ground immunity granted by Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to set up in the face of Gliscor and spinblock Great Tusk in a pinch. Heavy-Duty Boots is another option on teams that lack any entry hazard removal. Gholdengo can make great use of a wide variety of Tera types, both for offensive and defensive purposes: Tera Fairy or Fighting gives it a sudden resistance to Dark, potentially mitigating the damage from moves like Knock Off, Crunch, and Sucker Punch from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Kingambit, respectively. Tera Fairy lacks Tera Fighting's weakness to Fairy, allowing Gholdengo to still serve as a soft check to Iron Valiant and Enamorus in a pinch, whereas Tera Fighting gives Focus Blast an additional STAB boost, allowing +2 Gholdengo to OHKO Ting-Lu after Stealth Rock. Tera Steel can give an additional boost to Make It Rain, granting Gholdengo an OHKO on Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk, as well as lessening the damage of Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult. Thanks to Good as Gold, any team can make great use of Gholdengo’s ability to spinblock and prevent Defog, but an offensive team would make the best use of its wallbreaking power. Offensive hazard-stacking cores featuring Pokemon such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S can use Gholdengo’s help to keep the pressure on. Powerful Pokemon that take advantage of the switches that Gholdengo forces, like Weavile and Meowscarada with Spikes, as well as other Nasty Plot wallbreakers like Darkrai provide support for Gholdengo to whittle down defensive cores. In addition, other special attackers that have access to utility tools like Knock Off to cripple their shared walls and Pokemon that would otherwise absorb Knock Off, such as Gliscor, Skarmory, Corviknight and Clefable, Darkrai, and Iron Valiant, synergize well with Gholdengo's ability to block all hazard removal. Without using Tera, Gholdengo struggles against the Dark-types that are so common in the tier, such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott. Having teammates resistant to Dark-type attacks, like Zamazenta and Enamorus, give Gholdengo some extra protection and a way to strike back against them. Even if it's using Air Balloon, having another Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Gliscor or Tornadus-T, is extremely helpful to mitigate that weakness. Gholdengo’s Speed tier is still slightly lacking when compared to the rest of the OU tier, leaving it vulnerable to fast threats such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Weavile. Having some speed control on the team, such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Meowscarada or priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, to counteract these threats is extremely valuable. Defensive Gholdengo can serve as a bulky spinblocker and powerful setup sweeper in long matches. Its bulk, typing, and access to reliable recovery give it multiple opportunities to pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Corviknight, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable and make it a more reliable check to key offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Zamazenta. It can use its increased bulk to more safely set up a Nasty Plot while sustaining itself with Recover. Gholdengo possesses near perfect coverage with its STAB attacks, making it very difficult to respond to. Dazzling Gleam is an option over Make It Rain, as it deals high damage to Dark-types such as Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon after a Nasty Plot boost. 60 Speed EVs allow Gholdengo to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and Azumarill, as well as uninvested Landorus-T; alternatively, 92 Speed EVs can allow Gholdengo to also outspeed uninvested Gliscor at the cost of losing a noticeable amount of bulk. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to avoid taking Spikes damage and Ground-type attacks from prominent Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Gliscor, letting it setup on these Pokemon and more safely pivot into Rapid Spin users such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used instead to more reliably mitigate entry hazard damage and more frequently pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory even after it has taken damage. Rocky Helmet is a solid alternative to these items that can effectively punish physical attackers like Zamazenta, which is forced to commit to using Crunch against Gholdengo, and force it out due to the threat of significant chip damage. Gholdengo is a fantastic Terastallization candidate in most matches, as it greatly benefits from neutralizing all of its weaknesses to gain a crucial free turn to setup a Nasty Plot or heal itself with Recover. Tera Fairy gives Gholdengo a better matchup against various Dark-types such as Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Meowscarada and boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam. Tera Water improves Gholdengo's matchups against Iron Moth and Cinderace as well as providing a good defensive typing against much of the metagame. Tera Flying is an alternative option that lets it completely dominate Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu. Gholdengo fits quite well on bulky offense and balance teams as a spinblocker. Therefore, Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Skarmory, as well as Stealth Rock setters such as Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Landorus-T greatly appreciate Gholdengo's ability to block most forms of hazard removal. Offensive teammates also appreciate Gholdengo's presence due to its strong defensive profile and ability to absorb status moves. Kingambit in particular greatly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to block status moves and check Pokemon it struggles against such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant and can capitalize on Gholdengo luring and weakening its other checks such as Great Tusk. Iron Valiant similarly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, and it can lure and weaken key checks to Gholdengo such as Clodsire with Psyshock. Gholdengo often struggles against offensive teams due to its poor matchup against many key threats such as Darkrai, Kingambit, Iron Moth, and Roaring Moon. Great Tusk and Dondozo can help alleviate pressure by dealing with Kingambit while simultaneously benefiting from Gholdengo's defensive profile against faster special attackers such as Enamorus. Ting-Lu and Clodsire can handle the special attackers that give Gholdengo trouble, such as Dragapult, and accentuate Gholdengo's threat level with entry hazards. While Gholdengo is excellent at keeping entry hazards on the field, it can often struggle against opposing entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Clodsire, particularly if it is unable to Terastallize. Therefore, hazard removal support from Great Tusk is beneficial. Hex Gholdengo is a powerful support Pokemon and paralysis spreader. Thunder Wave cripples many Pokemon Gholdengo typically struggles with such as Hisuian Samurott, Darkrai, and Cinderace while also being useful against Pokemon Gholdengo is tasked with handling, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. It can then follow up with a powerful Hex on subsequent switch-ins. Make It Rain is the preferred option in the last slot to hit specially frail Ground-types, such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T, and Garganacl for high damage. Dazzling Gleam still hits Great Tusk for good damage while also hitting other Pokemon such as Hisuian Samurott and Roaring Moon quite hard. Focus Blast is another option that can be used in the last slot, as it is Gholdengo's strongest move against Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, having a good chance to OHKO both. However, its poor accuracy makes it quite unreliable compared to Dazzling Gleam or Make It Rain. 60 Speed EVs allow Gholdengo to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and uninvested Landorus-T. Gholdengo's item slot is quite flexible. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to avoid Ground-type moves, letting it more reliably spinblock Great Tusk, as well as check Dragonite. Leftovers is also an option, as Gholdengo can force a good amount of switches, granting it more residual healing. Rocky Helmet greatly improves Gholdengo's matchup against Zamazenta, which is forced to use Crunch to meaningfully damage Gholdengo and as such takes significant chip damage. Colbur Berry can also be considered, as it allows Gholdengo to more effectively lure in and paralyze Dark-types such as Weavile and Darkrai while also making it a more reliable answer to Swords Dance Iron Valiant. On teams without hazard removal, Heavy Duty-Boots is also an option to avoid entry hazard damage. Gholdengo can be an effective Tera candidate in order to check a wider range of threats with Thunder Wave. Tera Fairy allows Gholdengo to better check utility Dragapult and resist Dark-type moves from Pokemon such as Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Darkrai, allowing it to get off a crucial Thunder Wave against them. Tera Fairy also has the added benefit of boosting Dazzling Gleam's damage, allowing it to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk while also being helpful against Garganacl by lowering Salt Cure damage. Alternatively, Tera Water improves Gholdengo's matchup against Fire-types such as Iron Moth and Cinderace. Gholdengo is an effective option on teams looking for a bulky spinblocker and paralysis support. Hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Ribombee all benefit from its ability to block removal from the likes of Corviknight and Great Tusk. Kingambit greatly benefits from Gholdengo's presence due to it checking Zamazenta and spreading paralysis, allowing Kingambit to outspeed and KO targets such as Darkrai, Weavile, and opposing Kingambit. Darkrai similarly appreciates Gholdengo's ability to paralyze Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth, allowing it to more effectively sweep in the late-game. Iron Valiant also enjoys Gholdengo's presence to handle Galarian Slowking and Zamazenta, as well as its ability to spread paralysis to make Iron Valiant less reliant on Booster Energy to revenge kill Pokemon such as Darkrai. Garganacl appreciates Gholdengo's ability to spinblock its Stealth Rock and handle Pokemon it struggles against, such as Galarian Slowking and Encore users such as Ogerpon and Iron Valiant. In turn, Garganacl aids Gholdengo against Fire-types it may struggle against such as Iron Moth, as well as opposing Ghost-types such as Dragapult. As this Gholdengo set is not running a boosting move, it can struggle to make progress against certain Pokemon, particularly bulky Ground- and Electric-types such as Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Raging Bolt. As such, it appreciates partners that can handle these types of Pokemon. Great Tusk is an excellent partner, as it can undo any hazards Ting-Lu or Iron Treads set up, switch into Raging Bolt's Electric-type moves, and deal good damage to all three with Headlong Rush. It is also effective against other Pokemon Gholdengo may struggle with such as Kingambit. Darkrai can lure and deal heavy damage to Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire with its Nasty Plot-boosted Ice Beam, making it easier for Gholdengo to break through them later. Ogerpon-W can easily break past Ground-types with Ivy Cudgel and is effective at luring in and KOing Raging Bolt with Play Rough. It also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to handle Zamazenta and paralyze faster targets such as Darkrai and Roaring Moon. As Gholdengo's bulk is middling, it can be prone to being overwhelmed by faster threats such as Darkrai, Roaring Moon, and Iron Moth. Dragonite and Raging Bolt can revenge kill these Pokemon with their powerful Extreme Speed and Thunderclap, respectively, while also being able to weaken Ground-types that may switch into Gholdengo with Ice Spinner and Draco Meteor, respectively. Similarly, Zamazenta can also use these Pokemon as an entry point to set up and sweep with Iron Defense. Dragonite and Zamazenta appreciate Gholdengo's ability to handle their checks such as Enamorus and Skarmory, while Raging Bolt appreciates Gholdengo's ability to weaken Ground-type such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. As any status will boost Hex's power, Gholdengo appreciates support from other status spreaders. Moltres can help by spreading burns with Flame Body on Pokemon that typically annoy Gholdengo such Great Tusk and Kingambit while also checking Fire-types like Cinderace. Gliscor is similarly effective at spreading Toxic against Ground- and Electric-types such as Ting-Lu and Raging Bolt, while also completely walling Clodsire. In turn, Gholdengo helps Gliscor maintain its Spikes on the field. Choice Scarf Gholdengo is a great speed control option in the tier capable of outrunning and revenge killing premier offensive threats like Dragapult, Choice Specs Enamorus, and Weavile. Shadow Ball allows it to threaten foes like Galarian Slowking, Skarmory, and Dragapult, while Make It Rain, with its high Base Power, not only becomes challenging to switch into but also enables Gholdengo to effectively revenge kill Pokemon like Enamorus. Trick is a good utility move that allows it to Choice-lock Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Gliscor, hampering their effectiveness. Focus Blast enables Gholdengo to hit Dark-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used to turn Gholdengo into a potent late-game cleaner once it has successfully used Trick to get rid of its Choice Scarf. In another vein, Recover can be utilized to keep Gholdengo healthy, especially against bulkier foes, once it has used Trick, allowing it to check them more consistently. Tera Fighting gives Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type moves, most notably Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and it gives Focus Blast a STAB boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying can be used to help Gholdengo against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Gliscor. Gholdengo fits well on bulky offense and balance teams, where it functions as a great revenge killer. Teammates that benefit from Gholdengo's presence include Pokemon that appreciate its ability to handle fast and strong offensive threats. For instance, setup sweepers like Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Bulk Up Great Tusk can capitalize on Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill and weaken opposing threats like Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus, creating opportunities for Gholdengo's partners to set up and sweep. Great Tusk's access to Rapid Spin also synergizes well with Gholdengo, which is punished by Spikes, so getting rid of them gives Gholdengo more opportunities to switch in. Entry hazard setters like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu also benefit from Gholdengo's ability to serve as an emergency spinblocker. Due to its vulnerability to Dark-type Pokemon like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, exacerbated by its reliance on the inaccurate Focus Blast and the inherent risk of being Choice-locked, Gholdengo greatly benefits from the support of teammates that check the aforementioned foes, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Rillaboom also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Grassy Terrain weakens the super effective Earthquake, in addition to acting as a check to foes like Ting-Lu. In return, Gholdengo helps Rillaboom by handling threats that would otherwise be problematic for the latter, such as Corviknight and Skarmory."

  "Giratina-Origin": {
    "name": "Giratina-Origin",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Giratina-O is most notable for being the only offensive Defog user in Ubers, giving it a distinct niche. Its high bulk and unique typing combined with Levitate give it great use against top metagame threats like Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Kyogre. While its offensive stats are a bit low by Ubers standards, it makes up for it with Griseous Core's boost and access to high-Base Power moves like Poltergeist, Draco Meteor, and Hex. Furthermore, Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Shadow Sneak are all great utility options at Giratina-O's disposal. Giratina-O is also one of the best users of Terastallization in the tier, becoming extremely tanky with Tera Steel or Poison in combination with Levitate. However, Giratina-O has no reliable recovery and thus can be chipped down by Stealth Rock and Ruination damage over time. It also stacks weaknesses with Koraidon and Miraidon, two of the most common Pokemon in the tier. Although it necessitates teammates like Necrozma-DM to not run Knock Off, Poltergeist is a strong Ghost-type attack that is very spammable due to how few Pokemon that resist Ghost there are in the tier. Dragon Tail is a decently strong Dragon-type attack that has utility for forcing out Extreme Killer Arceus, which often runs Taunt, and Ting-Lu. Of the two status options, Will-O-Wisp should be run with Defog, as it pressures Ting-Lu much more; Ting-Lu can otherwise heal off damage with Leftovers, pressure Giratina-O with Ruination, and set entry hazards. Thunder Wave pressures common switch-ins like Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy much more, and as such is preferred when not running Defog. Access to Defog is extremely few and far between in Ubers, and therefore Giratina-O's access to it provides immense utility. It can be critical for maintaining an advantage in entry hazard management, especially once opposing entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu are taken out of the picture. Despite this utility, other options are still available for more offensively-minded teams. Shadow Sneak is a useful priority move that becomes very strong when combined with Tera Ghost; the combination of Tera Ghost Poltergeist and Shadow Sneak will even take out Koraidon. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used to KO Ho-Oh, which otherwise takes non-Tera Ghost Poltergeist without worry. The given EVs allow Giratina-O to survive +2 Tera Ghost Arceus's Shadow Claw as well as +2 Life Orb Arceus's Shadow Claw after Stealth Rock damage. The Speed EVs are enough to outspeed uninvested Gliscor, with the rest dumped into Attack. Tera Steel should be run on Defog sets, as it negates all of Giratina-O's normal weaknesses, allowing Giratina-O to turn the tide against many Pokemon such as Koraidon using Scale Shot and Gliscor using Toxic. Tera Poison is another option, as it provides similar utility to Tera Steel without being weak to Koraidon's Flare Blitz. Giratina-O is an excellent way to finish off most defensive cores in the tier, as its Defog support and ability to check Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Kyogre are very valuable. As such, classic defensive Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Fairy, Ting-Lu, and Arceus-Water are all fantastic partners. Miraidon deserves mention, since it can pressure Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Gliscor extremely well, potentially leading to a huge advantage in entry hazard management. Giratina-O's Defog support can also enable some powerful wallbreakers like Choice Band Chien-Pao and Choice Specs Kyogre, which may not normally fit on most teams due to being too weak to entry hazards. Thunder Wave is Giratina-O's best option for punishing Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy, while Will-O-Wisp is a stronger option against Arceus, Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground, and Ting-Lu. Giratina-O's access to Defog gives it a unique niche on bulky offense and balance teams that can sufficiently pressure Ting-Lu. The given EV spread lets Giratina-O survive Shadow Claw from both Life Orb Arceus and Heavy-Duty Boots Tera Ghost Arceus after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage while outspeeding uninvested Gliscor. Tera Steel lets Giratina-O stonewall Gliscor and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, pivot into Arceus-Fairy more easily, and take on Scale Shot Koraidon and Miraidon. Tera Poison is an alternative that still punishes Gliscor and Arceus-Fairy without giving Giratina-O a weakness to Low Kick and Flare Blitz from Koraidon and Close Combat from Zacian-C. Giratina-O pairs well with teams that appreciate its ability to both check Arceus-Ground, Necrozma-DM, and Extreme Killer Arceus and keep entry hazards off the field against Spikes stacking teams. Arceus-Fairy and Gliscor are strong partners for their ability to punish Ting-Lu while pivoting around Koraidon and Miraidon, respectively. Necrozma-DM is a great partner to pressure Ho-Oh with Knock Off, Stone Edge, or boosted Photon Geyser. This is appreciated, since Ho-Oh can pivot into Giratina-O and entirely wall Will-O-Wisp variants while also checking Arceus-Fairy. Teammates that use Choice items such as Choice Scarf Koraidon, Choice Specs Miraidon, Choice Specs Kyogre, Choice Specs Flutter Mane, and Choice Band Chien-Pao appreciate Giratina-O removing hazards from the field, letting them not take hazard damage when they switch in and thus giving them more opportunities against bulkier teams that can annoy Giratina-O. Other teammates that appreciate Defog include Calm Mind Kyogre with Leftovers, Draco Plate Miraidon, and defensive Arceus formes. Miraidon is an especially notable partner for forcing progress on Ting-Lu while pivoting around Ho-Oh, letting Giratina-O win the hazard war in the long run. Ting-Lu and Gliscor pair well with Giratina-O by checking Miraidon and complementing Giratina-O's ability to spread status with additional hazard damage. Shadow Ball is possible over Hex to have a stronger attack in the short term; this may notably help against Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground. Calm Mind sets are a possibility, but Giratina-O's lack of recovery really limits its ability to sweep. Support Arceus Formes: Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water can shrug off any attack Giratina-O throws at them, though neither appreciate status. Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh can handle most attacks from Giratina-O, as it has high bulk and is immune to Will-O-Wisp. However, Stone Edge, Thunder Wave, and Tera Ghost-boosted Poltergeist all threaten Ho-Oh. Chip Damage: Giratina-O has no recovery, so damage from poison, burn, or Stealth Rock can add up over time. Ting-Lu's Ruination can also greatly reduce Giratina-O's ability to check threats."

  "Glaceon": {
    "name": "Glaceon",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Glaceon is a niche special attacker that is capable of occasionally providing offensive value with its high Special Attack stat and access to Freeze-Dry. However, it is largely held back by its low Speed stat, lack of coverage, and its Ice typing's poor defensive profile. Wallbreaker: Glaceon often uses four attacking moves, usually paired with Choice Specs or Heavy-Duty Boots, to trade for damage early- to mid-game. Defensive Utility: With Wish to stay healthy, a bulkier Glaceon can come in several times throughout the game to pressure out offensive Pokemon that are weak to Freeze-Dry. Roar, Haze, and Yawn can be used to prevent foes from setting up on it. Setup Sweeper: Glaceon can attempt to use Calm Mind and occasionally Trailblaze, usually paired with Tera, to sweep. Primary STAB Moves: Ice Beam, Freeze-Dry Setup Moves: Calm Mind Utility Moves: Roar, Haze, Substitute, Yawn, Wish Coverage: Shadow Ball, Alluring Voice, Tera Blast Blizzard: Blizzard can be used as a primary STAB move in battles where snow is expected to be up, such as when Glaceon is paired with a Slowking forme or when facing a snow team. Mud Shot / Water Pulse: Mud Shot and Water Pulse are Glaceon's best coverage options against Steel- and Fire-types without Terastallizing. Ice Shard: Despite being a Special Attacker, Ice Shard gives Glaceon an option to pick off faster weakened targets, making it a good option as a filler move. Stored Power: On setup sets, Stored Power gives Glaceon another spammable move option other than its STAB moves. Trailblaze: Trailblaze can help mitigate Glaceon's issues with Speed, although it needs multiple Speed boosts to outspeed the fastest threats. Mirror Coat: With enough bulk investment, a resistance Berry, or a Focus Sash, Glaceon can trade for damage or KOs against strong special attackers with Mirror Coat. Heavy-Duty Boots: Since Glaceon is an Ice-type, it appreciates Heavy-Duty Boots preventing the entry damage from Stealth Rock. Choice Specs: Choice Specs can turn Glaceon into a terrifying wallbreaker in the right situations. Other Damage-boosting Items: Items such as Expert Belt and Never-Melt Ice give Glaceon a damage boost on sets that don't want to lock into a move by running Choice Specs. Weakness Policy: Glaceon's passable bulk and numerous weaknesses occasionally makes Weakness Policy a viable option. When positioned correctly, Weakness Policy allows it to fire back at the attacker for massive damage or set up for a sweep with Trailblaze. Resistance Berries: Resistance Berries such as a Chople and Occa Berry let Glaceon trade for damage more effectively against Pokemon with a favorable type matchup or good coverage options. Focus Sash: Like Resistance Berries, a Focus Sash helps Glaceon guarantee damage against offensive threats with its STAB move of choice or Mirror Coat. Choice Scarf: Choice Scarf allows Glaceon to outrun certain threats to get hits off more reliably. Leftovers: Since setup sets struggle to fit Wish for recovery, they most often rely on Leftovers for healing. Because of its low Speed and unfavorable defensive type, Glaceon appreciates the ability to Terastallize. However, its low cost means that it is typically outclassed by more expensive secondary Tera Captains. If made a Captain, defensive Tera types such as Tera Fairy and Water allow Calm Mind sets to set up more effectively, and offensive Tera types such as Tera Ground and Fire give it the secondary STAB typing necessary to hit foes that would otherwise wall it. Tera Ice can also be used, allowing Ice Beam to get 2HKOs on certain Ice-resistant foes when paired with Choice Specs. Glaceon is an overall niche pick as an Ice-type wallbreaker with access to Freeze-Dry, which fits best on teams that need cheap offensive support against Ice-weak Pokemon. Entry Hazard Removal: Because Glaceon is at its most threatening when not using Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Iron Treads are practically required for it to be useful at all. Strong Primary Offense: Due to its inconsistency, Glaceon is only supplementary for the primary offense on a draft. Strong, faster offensive pivots and wallbreakers such as Iron Moth, Meowscarada, and Greninja that benefit from Glaceon forcing damage in the early-game or allow it to position for a win in the late-game are needed for it to perform. Entry Hazards: Entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, keep Glaceon from entering the field safely, barring Heavy-Duty Boots sets, which tend to be easier to beat due to lower damage and longevity. Steel- and Fire-types: Since they are able to resist Glaceon's STAB moves and threaten it out with super effective STAB moves of their own, Steel- and Fire-type Pokemon such as Chi-Yu, Metagross, Scizor, and Blaziken often keep it in check. Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially bulky Pokemon that are neutral to Glaceon's Ice-type moves, such as Galarian Slowking, Tyranitar, and Hisuian Goodra, are able to switch in many times over to course of the game to force it out, especially if they have access to disruption moves to interfere with Calm Mind sets."

  "Glastrier": {
    "name": "Glastrier",
    "text": "Glastrier's defining role is that of a bulky physical wallbreaker. It has outstanding bulk for ZU; furthermore, its stellar base 145 Attack, Icicle Crash, and all the coverage it needs including Close Combat and High Horsepower make it extremely difficult to switch into. Lastly, Glastrier can boost its Attack even further with Swords Dance, allowing it to potentially OHKO or 2HKO almost the entire metagame. Defensive staples like Palossand, Snorlax, and Appletun are often forced to Terastallize or switch out versus it. This means that Glastrier's most reliable defensive counterplay is somewhat specific, being limited to almost exclusively both forms of Qwilfish, Regirock, and Orthworm, none of which have reliable recovery, and the latter two of which often require Terastallization to fully check Glastrier. Swords Dance Glastrier acts as a fearsome wallbreaker, leveraging its outstanding bulk and the threat of its attacks to create setup opportunities for itself. Close Combat takes on bulky Pokemon that resist Icicle Crash like Orthworm and Thick Fat Snorlax. High Horsepower is near mandatory to hit Qwilfish and serves as effective coverage for Fire-types. Tera Ground gives Glastrier a resistance to Rock while boosting the power of High Horsepower, while Tera Water and Fairy flip Glastrier's weaknesses to common offensive types like Fire and Fighting. 252 Speed EVs allows it to outspeed slower walls like Dudunsparce and Porygon2, while the bulk investment lets it take on powerful attacks from various threats in the tier. Glastrier greatly appreciates teammates that can help bring it in safely like Jolteon, Qwilfish, and Mesprit, since it often has to take a hit after switching in due to its poor Speed. Glastrier also works well alongside other wallbreakers like Choice Specs Jolteon, Hisuian Decidueye, and Charizard, as they are able to break down checks like Snorlax, Regirock, and Qwilfish for each other. Due to its many weaknesses as an Ice-type, Glastrier loves teammates it can fall back on to support it; some of these teammates include Snorlax, Palossand, Regirock, and Qwilfish. As a wallbreaker, Glastrier does exceedingly well alongside Pokemon like Grafaiai, Oricorio formes, and Typhlosion that can often take advantage of the holes that Glastrier makes in defensive cores through removal of foes like Snorlax, Dudunsparce, and Porygon2. Glastrier can opt to run Heavy Slam alongside Tera Steel over High Horsepower to hit light foes like Mesprit and Steel-weak foes like Tera Fairy Dipplin and Dudunsparce. However, trading out High Horsepower for Heavy Slam tends to be overkill, as Glastrier's standard three-move coverage sufficiently hits all relevant foes; furthermore, giving up High Horsepower makes it struggle more against foes like Hisuian Qwilfish. Glastrier can also consider running Substitute to ease prediction, but all of its coverage moves are near mandatory, and without Swords Dance, Glastrier can struggle to threaten the walls it needs to. Faster Attackers: Glastrier's awful Speed means it can often be a target for offensive threats like Typhlosion, Charizard, Passimian, and Hisuian Decidueye, though it often has to be chipped in order to not take them down with it. Qwilfish: Both forms of Qwilfish can be quite problematic for Glastrier; regular Qwilfish resists every move except High Horsepower, which it takes relatively little damage from after Intimidate, while Hisuian Qwilfish sports better overall bulk due to its Eviolite. Furthermore, both can use Glastrier's massive HP stat against it with Pain Split, allowing them to trade positively with it and poison it with Barb Barrage or Toxic. Bulky Threats: Iron Press users like Orthworm and Regirock can match Glastrier's setup and threaten it out, though they may at times require Terastallization to do so. Poliwrath and Snorlax can do the same with Bulk Up and Curse, respectively, though Snorlax must Terastallize first. Weezing is able to neuter Glastrier with Will-O-Wisp and can switch in fairly safely, only fearing boosted Icicle Crash. Status: Glastrier gets worn down rapidly by poison from Pokemon like Qwilfish and Muk as well as burn from Pokemon like Weezing and Mismagius; burn also neuters its damage."

  "Glimmet": {
    "name": "Glimmet",
    "text": "Glimmet stands out as one of the tier's best entry hazard setters, learning both Stealth Rock and Spikes and setting Toxic Spikes via its signature ability Toxic Debris. Its unique typing allows it to switch into common threats such as Vullaby and Hisuian Growlithe and set up hazards for its teammates. Mud Shot complements Glimmet's two STAB moves well, giving it crucial coverage for Steel-types and opposing Glimmet. Sludge Bomb is its most powerful STAB move, but Spikes may be used over it to stack additional hazards for its team. Tera Flying is used to turn the tables on Ground-types and to escape being trapped and OHKOed by Trapinch. Glimmet fits best on hyper offense or bulky offense teams that can make good use of the hazards it sets. Powerful attackers and sweepers such as Stunky and Shellder appreciate the hazards set by Glimmet to wear down their checks. Vullaby pairs well with Glimmet, as it covers its type weaknesses well and can take advantage of hazards with its strong attacks. Toedscool and Mienfoo appreciate Glimmet's ability to switch into Vullaby and other Flying-types, whilst in return, they switch into and threaten opposing Ground- and Steel-types respectively."

  "Glimmora": {
    "name": "Glimmora",
    "text": "Glimmora is one of the tier's premier leads thanks to its ability to set up Stealth Rock and deny opposing entry hazards with Mortal Spin, all while scaring foes from activating Toxic Debris in the process. Toxic Debris's potential to set up Toxic Spikes can prove lethal against certain teams, particularly more offensive ones due to the lack of offensive Poison-types in OU outside of Iron Moth able to absorb them. Mortal Spin's side effect of inflicting poison detracts Pokemon such as Ting-Lu from setting up entry hazards multiple times and Hatterene from trying to deny Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Power Gem lets Glimmora hit most targets for decent damage, and notably chips at Corviknight, Skarmory, and Gliscor that would otherwise wall Glimmora, with Corviknight also removing its entry hazards with Defog. Earth Power allows Glimmora to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran, which otherwise are able to block Mortal Spin, with the former two also resisting Power Gem. Mud Shot is another option over Earth Power, as its side effect of lowering the foe's Speed allows Glimmora to win the mirror matchup against opposing Glimmora. Mud Shot can also slow down foes trying to use Glimmora as setup fodder, such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon, preventing them from getting out of hand. Focus Sash allows Glimmora to survive any one hit and thus be able to set up Stealth Rock safely. Red Card can be used instead, allowing Glimmora to make use of its natural bulk and typing to take a hit and thus phaze setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth—which is notable in the hyper offense mirror—preventing its team from getting overrun by boosted offensive threats. Red Card is also useful to disrupt the opposing team, potentially forcing a foe out to take Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes damage. Tera Ghost grants Glimmora with an immunity to Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads, denying their attempts from removing Glimmora's entry hazards. Glimmora finds its home on hyper offense teams that enjoy it starting the match strong by setting up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes from the beginning. Kingambit greatly appreciates this, as even Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch like Roaring Moon and Enamorus can potentially get KOed by +2 Sucker Punch after a round or two of Stealth Rock, while physically defensive walls trying to switch in like Skarmory and Corviknight have to contend with not only Kingambit's attacks but also with the chip damage from Stealth Rock. Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant similarly enjoy Glimmora's entry hazards chipping at the foes for them and the rest of the team to win late-game, while they also provide Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Alomomola, and Clodsire, making them susceptible to its hazards. Gholdengo may be used alongside Glimmora, as its Ghost typing and Good as Gold ability let it block Rapid Spin and Defog attempts, thus making sure Glimmora's entry hazards stay up. Glimmora may also play a defensive role on occasion, as its good matchup against Skeledirge lets it assist teammates like Iron Moth and Zamazenta that can struggle against it. Glimmora's unique typing, high Special Attack, and good coverage make it a great wallbreaker and potentially late-game cleaner. In addition to Glimmora's offensive prowess, Toxic Debris can deter foes with Toxic Spikes, which can be difficult for opposing teams to handle, especially offensive ones due to the lack of offensive Poison-type Pokemon; this is another valuable trait that Glimmora has. Meteor Beam helps Glimmora power through the likes of Corviknight, Garganacl, and Galarian Slowking. Meteor Beam can also surprise a common switch-in, Air Balloon Gholdengo, as it cannot take a Meteor Beam on switch-in followed by a boosted Earth Power. Sludge Wave hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Primarina and most neutral targets other than Blissey. Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran can take Glimmora's STAB moves, so Earth Power provides excellent coverage for them as well as opposing Glimmora, Raging Bolt, and Skeledirge after its Power Herb has been consumed. Gholdengo, even with Air Balloon, cannot reliably switch into a Meteor Beam into Earth Power. In the last slot, Glimmora can run Dazzling Gleam to reliably hit the Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Roaring Moon once Glimmora's Power Herb has been consumed. Optionally, Glimmora can also run Tera Fairy to power up Dazzling Gleam and gain a better defensive typing to deal with faster attackers like Dragapult and Darkrai, as well as gaining a neutrality to Ground to take Roaring Moon's Earthquake in a pinch. Rock Polish is another option that makes up for Glimmora's lackluster Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed notable threats such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after one use. Finally, Power Gem gives Glimmora a reliable Rock-type STAB move after Power Herb has been consumed. Aside from gaining a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, both Tera Grass and Tera Flying give it an immunity and a resistance to Ground, respectively, with Tera Flying having the drawback of being weak to priority Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Tera Grass also provides Glimmora with better Ogerpon-W and Great Tusk matchups. This set primarily fits on hyper offense teams, especially Sticky Web teams where Glimmora's lackluster Speed is made up for. As such, Sticky Web setters like Ribombee are fantastic partners. Glimmora excels against opposing offense, as many opposing offense teams struggle with Toxic Spikes, meaning the opponent must be careful with how they attack Glimmora. This careful play can be punished by breaking through common bulkier threats that fit well on offense, such as Zamazenta and Gholdengo. Glimmora struggles against bulkier teams that make use of Heavy-Duty Boots; as such, Glimmora appreciates the presence of powerful wallbreakers and Knock Off users, such as Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-W, and Roaring Moon. Sturdy special walls such as Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire also give Glimmora trouble, so it appreciates other entry hazards to wear them down over time, which foes like Landorus-T and Hisuian Samurott can provide. Hisuian Samurott can also provide Knock Off support to get rid of their Heavy-Duty Boots. Gholdengo is also a great partner, as it can block hazard removal to keep Glimmora's Toxic Spikes up; it also provides good defensive utility by checking Galarian Slowking. Kingambit is a great offensive partner that can take advantage of the Toxic Spikes that Glimmora sets up and clean up late-game after Glimmora has broken through the opposing team."

  "Gliscor": {
    "name": "Gliscor",
    "text": "Gliscor can make a lot of easy progress throughout the game thanks to its great bulk, being able to use Swords Dance in front of opposing Gliscor and other passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Clodsire, and Toxapex to become an offensive threat. Gliscor being permanently affected by poison allows it to use Facade consistently, which breaks Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W, Hawlucha, and Dragonite. Swords Dance Gliscor can threaten common Knock Off absorbers like Clefable, particularly on Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, so it can effectively use Knock Off instead against these teams to punish different foes, especially entry hazard-weak Pokemon such as Zapdos and Enamorus. Ice Fang is another option that can be run over Knock Off to shut down opposing Swords Dance Gliscor, which may give the team trouble, and hits Dragonite hard while still targeting Rillaboom. Tera Water flips Gliscor's matchup against Ice- and Water-types such as Weavile and Barraskewda defensively; however, it becomes a worse check to Pokemon such as Rillaboom. Tera Normal should always be run alongside Facade to muscle past physically bulky threats like Moltres, Zapdos, and Alomomola after a Swords Dance. Gliscor also greatly appreciates Tera Normal's immunity to Ghost-type attacks, most notably Hex from Dragapult and Gholdengo looking to turn Gliscor's Poison Heal into a liability. For teams that are not as strong defensively into Grass-types, Tera Dragon is recommended, as it covers for both Water and Grass, and most notably, it shuts down Ogerpon-W and gains a better matchup versus Serperior and other potent offensive threats that would have been able to beat Gliscor even with Tera Water. 16 Special Defense EVs allow Gliscor to survive both a Choice Specs Enamorus's Moonblast and Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost from full health, or it can be given more special bulk to better handle common offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Iron Moth, which may chunk it heavily and affect its time on field otherwise. The 36 Defense EVs on the specially bulky EV spread allow Gliscor to comfortably survive Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel from full health. Swords Dance Gliscor best fits on teams that need to break balance structures, most prominently teams that utilize multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users. Gliscor enjoys being a part of Spikes-stacking teams that need guaranteed progress against opposing Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, which Spikes-stacking teams usually lose to. As a result, Ting-Lu and Skarmory are great teammates, as they can set up entry hazards and directly complement Gliscor defensively. Gholdengo also pairs well, preventing Defog and hindering the removal of hazards. However, Gliscor's lack of Toxic or hazards makes it exert less pressure long-term, prevents it from placing opposing Pokemon on a timer such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, and means it cannot punish any switch-ins to it with a Toxic. Teammates such as Weavile and Choice Specs Dragapult help Gliscor's lack of pressure with great upfront damage. Swords Dance Gliscor is also unable to deal with the common Iron Defense Skarmory on balance teams or muscle through common defensive walls such as Dondozo and Corviknight; however, access to Knock Off allows it remove their items at the very least, which could be helpful in the long run for Gliscor's teammates. Teammates such as, Cinderace and Rotom-W are great with Swords Dance Gliscor, as they can beat the fatter Pokemon that Gliscor is unable to muscle through, such as the aforementioned Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight. Gholdengo and Ogerpon-W are also good options, as they are able to turn threats such as Skarmory and Dondozo into setup fodder. Gliscor is a premier Spikes user. The combination of Poison Heal and Protect allows it to outlast common entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and Cinderace, setting it apart from its peers. Gliscor can survive some of the strongest neutral attacks in the tier with ease, including Life Orb Darkrai's Dark Pulse, Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball, and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave. Its immunity to status conditions helps it against more defensively oriented teams, allowing it to be unfazed by Toxic from opposing Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire or by Will-O-Wisp from Cinderace and Skeledirge. Protect is not just useful for giving Gliscor a free turn of recovery; it is also useful for scouting the moves of Choice-locked Pokemon that are able to break it, like Walking Wake. Toxic is used to whittle away at the foe’s health, as the combination of Toxic and Protect allows the poison damage to worsen while Gliscor heals itself in the process. Gliscor spreads status exceptionally well because most Pokemon immune to Toxic like Clodsire and Gholdengo are weak to Earthquake. Toxic is not always required though, as Knock Off can be substituted over it to remove foes' Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing teams that rely on hazard stacking to make progress, especially if the team lacks another Knock Off user or have a different Toxic user. On stall teams, Poison Jab can be run instead to allow Gliscor to pressure Hatterene and Taunt Tera Flying Roaring Moon, which otherwise have extremely favorable matchups against the team. A specially defensive EV spread with a Careful nature checks Pokemon like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, retaining enough physical bulk to live Ogerpon-W's unboosted Ivy Cudgel from full. A physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature can be run instead to let Gliscor check Pokemon like Great Tusk lacking Ice Spinner, Dragonite, Iron Boulder, and Roaring Moon, and the Special Defense EVs provide enough special bulk to survive +1 Enamorus's Moonblast and +1 Raging Bolt's Dragon Pulse from full. Both sets run 244 HP EVs to maximize the amount of health Gliscor recovers from Poison Heal. Tera Water lets Gliscor flip bad matchups against Water-types like Walking Wake and Hisuian Samurott as well as Ice-types like Weavile while being a great defensive typing in general. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Spikes and grants an immunity to Facade from Ursaluna, which is otherwise very problematic for the bulky teams that Gliscor fits in, as well as Body Press from Zamazenta. However, these are best reserved as a last resort, since Gliscor immensely appreciates its base typing because of its Stealth Rock neutrality and Spikes immunity. Moreover, Gliscor's teammates will generally get more mileage from Tera, so using it on Gliscor is not worth it most of the time. Gliscor functions best on entry hazard stacking balance teams, since its role compression provides flexibility in what Pokemon and sets these structures can run; it is also excellent on stall teams due to its longevity and excellent defensive profile. Gliscor’s role as a Spikes setter and Toxic user gives its team a much easier time breaking down opposing defensive balances and pivoting cores, punishing switches and poisoning foes that decide to stay in. Gliscor works in conjunction with its offensive partners by forcing switches while also soaking up incoming attacks from powerful offensive threats, giving it and its teammates ample opportunities to force progress. With these traits, Gholdengo makes an amazing teammate for Gliscor, since after Gliscor sets up Spikes, Gholdengo blocks all removal options aside from Court Change Cinderace, which Gliscor can beat one-on-one. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate, being able to sponge hits from strong special attackers such as Walking Wake, Serperior, and Enamorus, many of which threaten Gliscor out. In return, Gliscor walls physical Ground-type attackers that easily dispose of Galarian Slowking, like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T. Stealth Rock users such as Ting-Lu and Clefable pair very well with Gliscor, and stacking hazards is a very effective way at making progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable, as well as Meowscarada and Weavile, work well with Gliscor, since they allow it to run Toxic to punish bulkier Pokemon, and they are able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that do not come in on Gliscor so that its hazards can chip more effectively throughout the game. Late-game cleaners such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Kingambit all work well with Gliscor too, as they appreciate their checks having to constantly switch and get chipped by Spikes early- and mid-game, putting them into KO range late-game. Because Gliscor is so excellent on stall teams, teammates like Dondozo, Clodsire, and Blissey greatly appreciate Gliscor's ability to force progress with Spikes and the niche Poison Jab, especially against threats to stall like Calm Mind Hatterene and Taunt Roaring Moon. In return, Dondozo can sponge powerful Ice-type attacks from Meowscarada and Weavile while keeping powerful physical attackers like Kingambit at bay, while Clodsire and Blissey can collectively wall the vast majority of special attackers and take some pressure off Gliscor as a result."

  "Golduck": {
    "name": "Golduck",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 2-3 points Overview: Golduck works as a paragon of offensive utility with powerful rain-boosted STAB moves, potent setup in Nasty Plot, colorful coverage options, and many support tools. However, its viability as a Swift Swim user—what it's most often drafted for—is a bit debatable. On the one hand, Golduck's Water typing and unimpressive stats leave it outpaced by nearly every other Swift Swim user when it comes to rain cleaning, as it can quickly get stretched out trying to beat the checks that others could simply muscle past. On the other hand, its surprisingly deep movepool offers it a myriad of ways to both support its allies and subvert its enemies, and its status as the \"cheapest\" Swift Swim user allows it to fit on any team that is not afraid of a little rain. Rain Cleaner: You don't need to be part Psychic-type to realize how scary Golduck can be in rain; its STAB Hydro Pump leaves a mark even on clear days, its Nasty Plot can turn it into a powerful wallbreaker, and its imposing coverage moves like Ice Beam, Psychic, and Grass Knot drown out the noise of any weakened Water-resistant foe. Specially defensive foes might try to shrug off these attacks, but they too will be underwater once they learn Golduck also possesses a usable Attack stat, rain-boosted Liquidation, and enough physical coverage to leave any foe with mist in their eyes. Offensive Utility: With dual screens, Knock Off, Encore, Flip Turn, Yawn, and many other utility options, Golduck's unnecessarily deep movepool and workable stats make it one of the best surprise utility pieces in the bargain bin! Primary STAB Moves: Hydro Pump, Surf, Liquidation, Aqua Jet Setup Moves: Nasty Plot, Calm Mind, Trailblaze, Rain Dance Utility Moves: Knock Off, Taunt, Encore, Haze, Yawn, Hypnosis, Light Screen, Reflect, Flip Turn, Clear Smog, Brick Break, Substitute Coverage: Focus Blast, Grass Knot, Ice Beam, Ice Punch, Low Kick, Power Gem, Psychic, Psyshock, Shadow Claw, Vacuum Wave, Zen Headbutt Psychic Noise: Foes trying to stall out Golduck with healing moves will be in for quite the headache once Psychic Noise is revealed! Future Sight: Future Sight may not pair well with damage-boosting items, but it does pair well with Flip Turn and whatever Fighting- and Poison-baiting allies are on Golduck's team. Fling: Big Nugget + Fling is a tale as old as time, but more supportive Golduck sets can opt to throw a Light Ball, Flame Orb, or Poison Barb for a bit of status-spreading action instead. Damage-boosting Items: Life Orb, Expert Belt, and Mystic Water allow Golduck to play to the best of both its strengths, boosting its damage output to new levels while still keeping the threat of its setup and coverage! Choice Specs / Choice Band: Some may say that Choice item Golduck hits like a truck, but getting hit by a truck would probably hurt less than taking Choice Band Liquidation or Choice Specs Hydro Pump in rain. Resistance Berries: Grass-types are Golduck's natural predators, but Rindo Berry is all that it needs to get a free attack or extra Nasty Plot! Wacan and Yache Berries allow it to set up against bulky Electric-types and the rare Freeze-Dry users as well, though these don't prey on it nearly as often. Light Clay: Acceptable bulk, dual screens, and Flip Turn pivoting? That's Light Clay Golduck, supporting its team no matter the weather. While Golduck can benefit from Terastallization, its mediocre stats and gimmicky playstyle mean you'd be hard-pressed to pick it over a more expensive secondary Tera Captain . If you were to make it a Captain, however, consider Tera Electric and Flying to grant extra coverage with Tera Blast, Tera Grass, Psychic, and Fighting to boost its best coverage, and Tera Water to ensure its rain-boosted STAB moves take no prisoners! Golduck's ability to play as a cleaner and surprise utility tool allows it to fit on many a mostly-complete team. Though its powers are most potent when it's paired with rain, this poultry's actually a poor fit for dedicated rain teams; it simply can't compete with the likes of Basculegion and Kingdra offensively, meaning the games where it'll come are be few and far between. Alternative Rain Setters: Since Golduck often does not fit well on dedicated rain teams, it can use alternative manual rain setters to surprise opponents. While almost any decent Pokemon with Rain Dance can get the job done in a pinch, Flying- and Electric-types like Zapdos and Dragonite are especially eager to pair with it; they can use the rain they set to spam Hurricane and Thunder, threatening Golduck's counters without stepping on its feet. Fire-weak Pokemon like Jirachi and Froslass find themselves a lot less flammable in rain, and pivots like Deoxys-D offer both rain and a safe entry. Finally, certain Prankster users like Tornadus, Grafaiai, and Klefki can make it rain with priority! Water-resistant Foes: Golduck's flaws as a Swift Swim user quickly become apparent when it can't hit the blue button and make all its problems go away. Pokemon like Azumarill and Roaring Moon are more than happy to remind trainers of this, forcing Golduck to rely on its coverage, which usually doesn't OHKO them without setup or prior chip, letting them cripple or KO it in return. Losing Rain: Once the weather clears, Golduck's easy to mob, as it loses both a massive damage and Speed boost. Bringing weather solely to smite it isn't a common strategy, but more traditional tactics like scouting with Protect, stalling the rain out with healing moves and Regenerator, and hard switching to trick it into using resisted attacks can minimize the damage it can do just as well. Slowking in particular is especially good at this; it can change the weather on a whim and switch in multiple times thanks to Regenerator and high bulk."

  "Golem": {
    "name": "Golem",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Leveraging its explosive capabilities through powerful moves off a high Attack stat in conjunction with Sturdy, letting it survive nuclear-level attacks, means Golem can efficiently detonate opposing Pokemon. Furthermore, it's a cheap pick capable of providing entry hazard and phasing support. Despite all this, these assets are solely theoretical, because Golem's dreadful defensive typing, pitiful Speed, and terrible Special Defense prevent it from blowing up in its roles. Dedicated lead sets can be played around or neutralized, and if Golem is not being led with, it struggles to find opportunities to burst in, let alone attack freely. Despite this, Golem can still be a great final-round pick capable of making even the strongest Pokemon go boom. Dedicated Lead: Between Sturdy, access to Stealth Rock, STAB EdgeQuake coverage, and Explosion, Golem can get up entry hazards and fire off one or two strong attacks before fainting off lead or act as a wallbreaking lead aimed at immediately blowing holes through the enemy team for allies to exploit. Revenge Killer: Because of Sturdy enabling Golem to survive any one hit no matter how strong, it can be an effective revenge killer where the opposing Pokemon either takes strong hits from Golem or is forced to switch out. Primary STAB Moves: Stone Edge, Rock Slide, Rock Blast, Earthquake, High Horsepower Setup Moves: Rock Polish, Curse, Iron Defense Utility Moves: Stealth Rock, Roar, Brick Break, Substitute, Bulldoze Coverage: Explosion, Body Press, Fire Punch, Gyro Ball, Hammer Arm, Heavy Slam, Thunder Punch Smack Down: Bringing pesky Ground-immune foes to the floor with Smack Down leaves them prone to being bombarded by Golem's powerful Earthquake. Custap Berry: The combination of Custap Berry and Sturdy allows Golem to set Stealth Rock reliably and have the opportunity to blast off a second hit. This is especially notable with Explosion as a way of gaining momentum while simultaneously preventing entry hazard removal attempts. Heavy-Duty Boots: Heavy-Duty Boots nullifying any type of entry hazard chip preserves Sturdy, allowing Golem to fulfill its role more consistently. Weakness Policy: Sturdy enables Golem to avoid OHKOs from super effective moves, which sets off Weakness Policy, letting it fire off attacks with the force of a megaton. However, given Golem's abysmal Speed stat, it only gets off one such attack at best, making this option easy for opponents to play around if they call the move it selects, as Golem is easily revenge killed after dropping to Sturdy. Choice Band: With a solid Attack and STAB on coveted EdgeQuake coverage, Golem can wallbreak if necessary by equipping a Choice Band. Red Card: Red Card alongside Sturdy turns Golem into the ultimate anti-setup weapon, ensuring that the opposing Pokemon is removed from the battlefield. Note that this requires entry hazards to be kept off the field in order to function, which is no easy task in the vast majority of matchups. Although allowing Golem to Terastallize is almost certainly a waste of your secondary Tera Captain slot, if there is somehow no other Pokemon on your draft that better utilizes this blessing, it definitely appreciates shedding its awful defensive type combination. Despite being easily forgotten, Golem does in fact boast excellent physical bulk, so superior defensive Tera types such as Tera Water, Steel, and Fairy can turn it into a capable physical wall. Tera Grass flips both of its debilitating 4x weaknesses on its head, allowing it to survive hits without going down to Sturdy so that it can retaliate. Offensively, Tera Rock and Ground intensifies the power of its STAB moves, while Tera Normal raises the power of Explosion to terrifying heights. Golem isn't a Pokemon you draft around, as it is not regularly brought to games nor necessitates support from its teammates. However, its anti-sweeper and lead support toolkit can be rather helpful for its teammates in some matchups. Strong Offensive Pokemon: Setup sweepers and wallbreakers alike can greatly benefit from Golem's ability to soften up enemy teams by setting Stealth Rock and dishing out good damage before providing momentum by fainting. Pokemon Vulnerable to Setup Sweepers: Pokemon that are prone to being taken advantage of by setup sweepers, such as Choice-locked Iron Moth and Latios after a Draco Meteor stat drop, appreciate Golem being a contingency plan that can stop setup sweepers in their tracks. Water- and Grass-types: Golem can struggle to pump out meaningful damage versus bulky Water- and Grass-types, especially if they carry reliable recovery, and it is immediately put into danger by virtue of its disastrous 4x weakness to both types. Multi-hit Moves: Multi-hit moves essentially bypass Sturdy's protection, meaning Golem is vulnerable to being OHKOd by moves such as Bullet Seed, Surging Strikes, Water Shuriken, and Icicle Spear. Priority Attacks: Priority attacks can pick off Golem after falling to Sturdy. Such attacks go off before Custap Berry activates, meaning it has no way to react. Chip Damage: Chip damage from pivoting moves, entry hazards, or status breaks Golem's Sturdy, making it easier to deal with. Pivoting moves are especially of note, as foes that resist Golem's attacks that are capable of threatening a KO on it can be easily brought in afterwards."

  "Golurk": {
    "name": "Golurk",
    "text": "Golurk is a potent wallbreaker with limited switch-ins thanks to its incredible STAB combination, which is resisted by only a few Pokemon in the tier. Golurk excels at dismantling common defensive cores thanks to its high Attack and great typing, which let it switch into and force out defensive staples like Galarian Slowbro and Bellibolt. Dynamic Punch lets Golurk 2HKO Wo-Chien while also hitting other Dark- and Normal-types like Scrafty and Snorlax and threatening confusion against everything else. Close Combat can be used as an alternative due to its higher Base Power, which lets it guarantee a 2HKO on Wo-Chien after Leech Seed recovery; however, Golurk misses out on the confusion, and the Defense and Special Defense drops make it more susceptible to being revenge killed. Ice Punch lets Golurk OHKO Bombirdier and Staraptor while also serving as a good middle ground into Gligar. Stone Edge can be used as an alternative that's stronger versus neutral targets and has a higher chance to land a critical hit; although, Golurk loses out on the ability to deal with Gligar. Tera Dark flips Golurk's Ghost and Dark weaknesses while also removing its Water and Ice weaknesses, allowing it to avoid revenge kill attempts from Pokemon like Skuntank, Bombirdier, and opposing Golurk. Tera Ghost can be used instead to further boost Golurk's power, letting it 2HKO Pokemon like Gligar and guaranteeing OHKOs against Pokemon like Rotom-H with Poltergeist while still removing its susceptibility to Water- and Ice-type moves to avoid revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-W. Golurk works best alongside Pokemon that benefit from its wallbreaking abilities such as Choice Scarf Staraptor and Curse Arcanine, which struggle with Bellibolt and Gastrodon, respectively. While Golurk has the coverage to hit the likes of Staraptor, Bombirdier, and Wo-Chien, their presence on the opposing team hurts its ability to freely use its STAB moves and forces it to make more predictions, so teammates that can handle these Pokemon like Bellibolt, which checks Staraptor and Bombirdier, and Paldean Tauros-F, which helps against Wo-Chien, make excellent partners. Furthermore, Paldean Tauros-F offensively and defensively checks the Dark-types that threaten Golurk, and other Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W and Flamigo are similarly good partners for this purpose. Golurk is also forced out by Water- and Grass-types, so teammates that can switch into these Pokemon, like Milotic and Gastrodon for Paldean Tauros-W and Tatsugiri as well as Skuntank for Decidueye, are incredible partners for Golurk. 84 Speed EVs let Golurk outrun -1 Arcanine and uninvested Alolan Sandslash. The bulk investment helps Golurk tank two consecutive Overheats from Rotom-H and Moonblasts from defensive Florges. Sample set. Stay tuned for updates!"

  "Goodra": {
    "name": "Goodra",
    "text": "Goodra finds a home in PU as a bulky attacker with exceptional offensive coverage, utility, and natural bulk. Flamethrower hits Steel-type walls like Bronzong and Copperajah for super effective damage, limiting the amount of times they can come in and try to absorb Draco Meteors. Sludge Bomb hits Florges, Grimmsnarl, and Scream Tail hard while also providing opportunities to fish for poisons against bulky Pokemon that don't immediately threaten Goodra like Coalossal, Gastrodon, Milotic, and Wo-Chien. Knock Off is a great utility move for Goodra, as it can remove Eviolite from Gligar and Heavy-Duty Boots from specially defensive walls like Coalossal and opposing Goodra, allowing entry hazards to hinder their ability to switch in later in the game. Toxic can more reliably hinder defensive walls like Bellibolt and Gastrodon than Sludge Bomb at the cost of not providing immediate damage. Acid Spray can be used to limit the ability of specially defensive walls like Coalossal and Gastrodon from absorbing attacks and stacking hazards. Both Toxic and Acid Spray can dissuade Pokemon like Hisuian Braviary and Rotom-H from setting up. Dragon Tail is an excellent utility move to phaze setup attempts, notably preventing Curse Arcanine, Scrafty, and Throat Spray Toxtricity from getting too comfortable, while accruing hazard chip damage. Scald is an optional move for Goodra that can hit Coalossal hard and fish for burns. Tera Poison gives Goodra a resistance to Fairy and Fighting, allowing it to more reliably match up into Florges, Scream Tail, and Paldean Tauros-W while also preventing Goodra from getting worn down by poison. Tera Poison does, however, limit Goodra as a switch-in to Ground-type attacks, notably making Gastrodon, Gligar, and Mudsdale much more difficult to switch into. Tera Fairy helps into opposing Goodra, Nasty Plot Tatsugiri, and Fighting-types like Hariyama and Paldean Tauros-W. Tera Dragon can be used to boost the damage output of Draco Meteor, allowing for notable OHKOs into Arcanine and Houndstone after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOs into Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Gligar, though it doesn't provide defensive utility like Tera Poison and Fairy do. Heavy-Duty Boots Goodra fits best on balance and bulky offense structures that can maximize its ability to both defensively and offensively apply pressure throughout a game. Goodra appreciates support from physically defensive teammates, such as Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone, that can switch into the litany of wallbreakers in the tier that threaten it like Staraptor and Paldean Tauros-W. Goodra can form defensive cores with entry hazard setters like Coalossal, Gastrodon, and Gligar to create difficult-to-break pairings that force switches and accumulate gradual chip. Offensive teammates that try to set up and clean late-game, like Curse Arcanine and Bulk Up Scrafty, can benefit from Goodra switching into and wearing down faster special attackers like Toxtricity and Zoroark. VoltTurn cores with teammates such as Ambipom, Kilowattrel, and Staraptor can pivot Goodra into favorable matchups safely and keep offensive pressure on. Poison- and Steel-types that can handle Fairy-types like Calm Mind Florges and Scream Tail, like Salazzle, Bronzong, and Copperajah, are excellent teammates to keep Goodra from needing to Tera to deal with them reliably. Choice Scarf users like Flamigo, Staraptor, and Toxtricity especially appreciate the gradual wear-and-tear that Knock Off Goodra and hazards can put on defensive foes, making their late-game cleaning or mid-game breaking much easier. Choice Specs Goodra functions as a competent wallbreaker in PU, utilizing its respectable Special Attack and excellent coverage to shred through foes. Sap Sipper is also extremely helpful, allowing Goodra to not fear Wo-Chien's Leech Seed, as well as letting it more easily come in against foes such as Rotom-C and Hisuian Electrode and retailiate with a devastating blow. Flamethrower gives Goodra the means to hit Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash and Levitate Bronzong for meaningful damage. Fire Blast is less reliable but does ensure the 2HKO on Bronzong after Leftovers recovery. However, Flamethrower is generally preferred, as it does not miss out on any important damage benchmarks, and Goodra's Fire-type coverage is most often used to punish Steel-types as they switch in. Sludge Bomb allows Goodra to catch Fairy-types expecting a Draco Meteor by surprise, such as Scream Tail and Florges. Goodra's last moveslot is customizable; Dragon Pulse offers a reliable alternative to Draco Meteor that exchanges power for perfect accuracy and the ability to secure 2HKOs against foes like Gastrodon and Bellibolt without worrying about being stalled out by Recover, while Scald offers a handy OHKO against Coalossal after Stealth Rock as well as the ability to bully physical wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W with the threat of a burn should they attempt to switch in on it. Tera Poison helps shore up Goodra's defensive matchup against Fairy-types like Grimmsnarl and Florges while boosting the power of Sludge Bomb, even giving Goodra a chance to OHKO Grimmsnarl after Stealth Rock. Tera Fairy also somewhat helps Goodra's defensive matchup against Fairy-types, helps it check foes like Paldean Tauros-W and Zoroark, and provides it with an immunity to opposing Goodra's STAB moves. Tera Dragon is also an option to boost the power of Draco Meteor to absurd levels, and it nets certain damage rolls such as OHKOing Bellibolt and having a chance to 2HKO Assault Vest Meloetta. It also bolsters Dragon Pulse's rather mediocre power but offers absolutely no additional defensive utility. A Modest nature can also be used for additional power, but this does notably make Goodra slower than Timid Hoopa and Adamant Heracross, Skuntank, and Bombirdier. Choice Specs Goodra is a powerful wallbreaker on balance teams, offering an intersection of power and unique defensive utility that can keep opponents guessing. Checks to Steel-types, such as Delphox and Paldean Tauros-F, are valued for their ability to make Goodra less prediction reliant, and Pokemon like Skuntank and Copperajah that can easily remove Fairy-types are immensely valuable due to making Draco Meteor much safer. Although it acts as a soft check to a large number of special attackers, Goodra can be worn down rather easily. For this reason, Florges and Scream Tail are also notable partners thanks to their ability to take some of the burden off of Goodra as a special wall while also compensating for its lack of recovery with Wish. Teammates like Gastrodon, Mudsdale, and Milotic greatly appreciate Goodra's immunity to Grass and can take the brunt of attacks that would otherwise wear it down quickly. While Goodra's special bulk is exceptional, the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots and recovery makes it difficult to get in safely, so pivots like Gligar, Rotom-H, and Scyther are greatly appreciated. In return, Goodra can whittle down checks to these Pokemon like Coalossal, Mudsdale, and Bellibolt with ease."

    "text": "Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra is a devastating wallbreaker in RU, leveraging its excellent defensive typing to switch into many attacks while using its diverse movepool to hit a wide range of targets. Thunderbolt allows Hisuian Goodra to consistently hit the Water-types of the tier, such as Slowbro, Empoleon, and Suicune. Flamethrower melts the Steel-types that resist both of Hisuian Goodra's STAB moves such as Jirachi, Magnezone, and Bisharp. Choice Specs boosts Hisuian Goodra's power to stupendous heights, allowing it to pick up OHKOs on the likes of Slowbro and Slither Wing that could otherwise stomach a hit from it. Gooey allows Hisuian Goodra to slow down physical attackers, notably crippling Maushold, which can help against in late-game situations against wallbreakers such as Slither Wing and Terrakion. 136 Speed EVs allow Hisuian Goodra to outspeed Adamant Conkeldurr. Tera Ghost removes Hisuian Goodra's Fighting weakness, allowing it to break through the likes of Terrakion, Slither Wing, and Mienshao. Tera Dragon boosts the power of Draco Meteor to absurd levels, allowing it to surprise an enemy that could otherwise take the hit, like Revavroom. However, this makes Hisuian Goodra weak to Ice, Fairy and Dragon, meaning it cannot switch in as easily against Pokemon such as Ice Beam Empoleon, Fezandipiti, and Noivern, so it's best used in a late-game scenario or once these foes have been KOed. Hisuian Goodra fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its ability to check threatening special setup sweepers such as Armarouge and Yanmega while giving them offensive firepower to help against bulkier teams. Fast sweepers such as Choice Scarf Gengar, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Barraskewda appreciate Hisuian Goodra's ability to wear down defensive pokemon such as Umbreon, Fezandipiti, and Empoleon early-game in order for them to clean up late-game. Wish support from teammates such as Umbreon and Vaporeon are great for Hisuian Goodra, as they are able to heal off the chip damage that Hisuian Goodra has taken and allow it to continue its assault upon the opposing team. Fighting- and Ground-resistant Pokemon such as Galarian Weezing and Talonflame are great partners, as they are able to take on the Fighting- and Ground-types, like Mienshao, Galarian Zapdos, and Krookodile, that threaten Hisuian Goodra and cripple them with Will-O-Wisp, massively increasing Hisuian Goodra's survivability in order for it to chunk the opposition more often. Other physically defensive teammates such as Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Hippowdon are also great partners for Hisuian Goodra, similarly taking the strong physical hits that are aimed at it while being able to support it by spreading status and setting entry hazards. Fairy-types such as Gardevoir and Fezandipiti are good offensive and defensive partners to Hisuian Goodra, as they are able to switch into the Fighting-type Pokemon that threaten Hisuian Goodra and force them out. In return, Hisuian Goodra is easily able to switch into and take advantage of the Steel-types that check them like Jirachi and Empoleon. Pivots such as Cyclizar and Slither Wing can bait in physical walls like Hippowdon, Galarian Weezing, and Chesnaught and pivot into Hisuian Goodra, which can then freely fire off a powerful attack."

    "text": "Gothita serves as a support Pokemon in Little Cup thanks to its ability to trap Poison-types such as Foongus and Mareanie and other metagame staples such as Mienfoo, forcing them to Terastallize to survive once in range of Psychic. Trick is very important on Gothita because without it, Gothita cannot reliably threaten a healthy Foongus due to the threat of Spore, and Trick is effective at crippling bulky foes. Thunderbolt provides coverage against Vullaby, while Energy Ball deals extra damage to Ground-types such as Mudbray. Tera Psychic is the most common Tera type to enable Gothita to secure earlier KOes such as OHKOing a healthy Mienfoo. Gothita fits best on bulky offense or balance teams with other pivots, most notably Mienfoo and Hisuian Voltorb, which typically struggle against bulky Regenerator Pokemon like Foongus and Mareanie. Choice Scarf Hisuian Growlithe also has significant synergy with Gothita, as bulky Fire resistant Pokemon such as Mareanie and Glimmet are vulnerable to being trapped. Gothita's biggest weaknesses are that it gives free entry to offensive Dark- and Steel-types after it secures a KO and that it lacks power by itself. Therefore, Gothita needs both a defensive backbone with teammates such as Mienfoo, Mudbray, and Glimmet to switch into Dark-types, as well as offensive threats and sweepers like Shellder and the aforementioned Hisuian Voltorb to break through defensive cores."

  "Gothorita": {
    "name": "Gothorita",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 2-3 points Overview: Gothorita is a much cheaper option to Gothitelle that trades item flexibility, coverage, and raw strength for significantly more bulk with Eviolite. Its role on a team is to use Shadow Tag to trap and KO foes that the rest of a team struggles with. Since the opponent knows to prepare for Shadow Tag, however, picking a target is not easy, as pivoting moves and Shed Shell can prevent foes from being trapped. Gothorita also finds difficulty breaking through Pokemon that aren't hit super effectively by Psychic-type moves, making its role as a trapper slightly more difficult to perform than Gothitelle's. Bulky Trapper: Using its natural bulk with Eviolite to trap foes with Shadow Tag, Gothorita can neutralize threats before eventually chipping them down. With no reliable healing outside of Rest, however, PP stalling offensive foes is a less viable strategy, and lowering the foe's Attack stat with Charm leaves it susceptible to eventually getting KOed with a critical hit, rendering the strategy useless against them. Primary STAB Moves: Psychic Noise, Psychic, Psyshock, Stored Power Setup Moves: Calm Mind, Nasty Plot Utility Moves: Charm, Foul Play, Rest, Taunt, Thunder Wave, Trick Coverage: Energy Ball, Grass Knot, Shadow Ball, Thunderbolt Imprison: If Gothorita is looking to trap another bulky Calm Mind user, Imprison could be useful in preventing it from setting up. Light Screen / Reflect: Although Gothorita has more permanent ways of lowering the foe's damage output in Charm and Calm Mind, Light Screen and Reflect can be used to reduce damage dealt to the rest of its team while it traps a foe it can easily set dual screens up on. Fake Tears: Fake Tears can be used to break down specially defensive walls faster than Calm Mind would, especially if said special wall is also a physical attacker. Trick Room: Against faster teams, Gothorita can freely use Trick Room on trapped targets with low health to gain control of the field after it KOes its foe. Eviolite: Gothorita benefits most from getting extra bulk from Eviolite. Choice Scarf: Acting as a way to either pick weakened foes off or debilitate them with Trick, Choice Scarf can catch opponents off-guard. Choice Specs: Choice Specs also adds some much needed power to Gothorita’s moves, and like Choice Scarf, it can cripple foes by using Trick. Items with Negative Effects: Negative-effect items such as Flame Orb, Toxic Orb, Lagging Tail, and Sticky Barb debilitate a foe when used with Trick. Just be certain to not let Gothorita get affected by the item before giving it away. Gothorita is surprisingly a usable choice as a secondary option for a Tera Captain when paired with a higher-valued Captain if nothing else can take better advantage of Terastallization. Giving it more options of what it can successfully trap and beat one-on-one, defensive types such as Tera Fairy, Water, and Steel are key standouts. Offensive types also have their uses, such as Tera Electric to boost its Thunderbolt against bulky Water-types and Tera Fighting to give it a coverage option against Dark- and Steel-types. Gothorita wants to support the rest of its team, especially by pressuring Fighting- and Poison-types as well as bulky Pokemon, making them either waste an item slot on Shed Shell or get trapped and KOed. Keeping this in mind, it wants to be on teams that struggle with removing said Pokemon but are not reliant on it coming to every match. Fighting- and Fairy-types: Pokemon that can remove Dark- and Steel-types for Gothorita, such as Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Urshifu-S, make its capabilities to check Pokemon much better. Pivots: Gothorita wants to be brought safely onto the field, and Pokemon such as Greninja, Ogerpon, and Palafin that typically demand to be checked defensively are perfect companions. Knock Off Users: Having multiple Pokemon that can remove potential Shed Shells to allow Gothorita to trap foes more easily is invaluable for compositions with it. A Team Unreliant on Gothorita: Gothorita is a gimmick, and relying on a gimmick every match is never the way to go. Make sure it is not essential to bring to every game. Shed Shell: Shed Shell is commonly brought on bulky Pokemon that Gothorita would normally trap and beat such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Great Tusk. Pivoting Moves: Moves that allow Pokemon to switch out to a favorable matchup make it harder for Gothorita to trap foes. Disruptive Moves: Although not stopping Shadow Tag, moves such as Taunt and Encore can greatly hinder Gothorita's trapping ability, as they disrupt it from being able to freely use the status moves it wants to. Knock Off Users: Pokemon like Deoxys-S, Mew, and Gardevoir that would normally get trapped by Gothorita can use Knock Off to greatly reduce its bulk. Dark- and Steel-types: With no way to super effectively hit Dark- and Steel-types without Terastallization, Pokemon such as Urshifu-S, Kingambit, and Scizor make for easy Gothorita answers. Ghost-types: Immune to Shadow Tag, Ghost-types can also super effectively hit Gothorita."

  "Gouging Fire": {
    "name": "Gouging Fire",
    "text": "Dragon Dance Gouging Fire is an amazing setup sweeper for Fire teams due to its part Dragon typing and its ability to take out pesky threats like Latios, Glimmora, Gliscor, and Ogerpon-W at +1. Flare Blitz after a Dragon Dance allows Gouging Fire to take out Kleavor and Ogerpon-W while also OHKOing Gliscor and Archaludon under sun with minimal chip. Loaded Dice + Scale Shot not only boosts Gouging Fire's Speed, but it also takes out Dragonite and Raging Bolt. Scale Shot is also a nice midground option, being able to deal with the Poison matchup effectively and notably 2HKOing Toxapex. When using Heavy-Duty Boots, Outrage or Dragon Claw can be run for consistency; Outrage provides strong damage output, being able to take out physically defensive Gouging Fire at +1, whereas Dragon Claw doesn't lock Gouging Fire into a potentially disadvantageous situation. Morning Sun can be run over Flare Blitz to increase its longevity throughout the battle. Earthquake at +1 threatens non-Air Balloon Heatran, which otherwise walls both of Gouging Fire's STAB moves. Furthermore, Earthquake allows Gouging Fire to hit Steel-types without taking the recoil it would take from using Flare Blitz. Ninetales and Torkoal are great teammates for Gouging Fire, providing sun support, which boosts Gouging Fire's Attack stat. Ninetales also provides Healing Wish support, while Torkoal sets entry hazards with Stealth Rock and removes them with Rapid Spin. The sun allows Gouging Fire to tank Water-type attacks from Choice Specs Keldeo while retaliating with Scale Shot. Ogerpon-H eases the Ground and Water matchups for Gouging Fire by dealing with pesky threats like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Slowbro. Ceruledge after a Swords Dance takes out Psychic- and Ghost-types that threaten Gouging Fire like Iron Boulder and Dragapult with Shadow Sneak. Choice Scarf users like Cinderace, Iron Moth, and Hisuian Arcanine are all great teammates for Gouging Fire, being able to take out a plethora of threats like Ursaluna-B, Primarina, Quagsire, and Air Balloon Heatran. Heatran tanks special attacks for Gouging Fire, notably from Choice Specs Flutter Mane while OHKOing back with Heavy Slam. Volcarona after a Quiver Dance is a nice late game sweeper for Gouging Fire that takes out pesky threats like Great Tusk, Hippowdon, and Glimmora with Giga Drain and Psychic. Talonflame provides a Ground immunity while also taking out Ogerpon-W with Brave Bird. Talonflame also removes hazards with Defog and weakens physical threats like Garchomp with Will-O-Wisp. Gouging Fire is a staple on Dragon teams due to its excellent bulk, neutrality to Fairy and Ice, and snowball potential, performing great in threatening matchups like Fairy, Ice, and Steel. Flare Blitz targets menacing Pokemon like Flutter Mane and Skarmory. Earthquake hits Pokemon resistant to Flare Blitz such as Toxapex, Heatran, and Glimmora. Morning Sun increases Gouging Fire's longevity and improves its setup ability. The specially defensive EV spread ensures that Gouging Fire outpaces Flutter Mane after a Dragon Dance, as well as makes Ice Beam from Choice Specs Greninja a 2HKO. Alternatively, the physically defensive EV spread ensures Choice Band Weavile's Triple Axel almost always wont 2HKO Gouging Fire, and it also outspeeds Choice Specs Latios after a Dragon Dance. Baxcalibur is a great teammate due to its ability to threaten Ground-types, such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Ursaluna-B, while also being crucial in the Dragon matchup—if Gouging Fire opts for Morning Sun. In exchange, Gouging Fire offers a Fairy neutrality and an answer to Skarmory and Air Balloon Gholdengo. Archaludon offers utility options like Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave to ease Gouging Fire's sweeping, as well as acting as a resistance to Dragon and Rock, taking on Roaring Moon and Iron Boulder. Choice Scarf Roaring Moon threatens fast Dragon-types such as Latias and Dragonite at +1 Speed, when Multiscale is broken, and appreciates Gouging Fire removing Steel-types. Dragapult can spread status ailments like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp, breaks physical walls like Slowbro, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-W using Choice Specs, and removes Pokemon like Choice Scarf Latias and Roaring Moon with a Choice Scarf set. In return, Dragapult appreciates Gouging Fire's ability to remove Hisuian Goodra, Clodsire, and Alolan Muk, while Dragon Dance sets value the Will-O-Wisp immunity. Garchomp sets up entry hazards to wear down Pokemon like Primarina and Ting-Lu and heavily dents teams with its Swords Dance set to allow Gouging Fire to clean late-game. Choice Scarf Latias provides a Ground immunity and removes threats like Great Tusk and Kommo-o, as well as offers cleric support via Healing Wish to give Gouging Fire new life when weakened or inflicted by status. Raging Bolt breaks Water-types, such as Primarina and Toxapex, and heavily damages Ground-types like Hippowdon, Gastrodon, and Gliscor after a Calm Mind. Hisuian Goodra is an excellent teammate for physically defensive Gouging Fire, as it stomachs hits from Latias, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Flutter Mane. Wallbreakers like Hydreigon and Choice Specs Latios remove Archaludon, Toxapex, and Slowbro. In return, Gouging Fire can combat threats such as Iron Valiant, Mimikyu, and Enamorus. Dragalge provides Toxic Spikes to put switch-ins like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk on a timer, as well as offers a secondary check to Fairy-types. Choice Band Gouging Fire is a monstrous wallbreaker on Fire teams, capable of shredding through common defensive staples such as Toxapex, Gliscor, and Clodsire with its nuclear STAB options and coverage with Earthquake. Outrage annihilates Dragon- and Water-types like Dragonite and Swampert attempting to switch in on Raging Fury, while Dragon Claw is a weaker but safer Dragon STAB option if the Outrage lock is undesirable. Earthquake rounds off the set by decimating miscellaneous switch-ins like non-Air Balloon Heatran and Toxapex trying to scout Gouging Fire's move choice; it also cleanly OHKOs Choice Scarf Iron Boulder, a major pain for Fire teams. The given EV spread allows Gouging Fire to get a Speed boost from Protosynthesis in sun to outpace the likes of non-Choice Scarf Landorus, Garchomp, and Choice Scarf Great Tusk. Ninetales and Torkoal are great partners for Gouging Fire, as they set up sun to both activate Protosynthesis as well as power up Gouging Fire's Raging Fury, letting it OHKO Clodsire, the Ogerpon formes, and Iron Valiant. Choice Scarf Ninetales provides a speed control option that can deal with foes like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R, which outspeeds Gouging Fire even with a Protosynthesis boost; it also provides Healing Wish support to let Gouging Fire wallbreak again or clean up weakened teams. Alternatively, Torkoal can set Stealth Rock to let Gouging Fire dispatch Gliscor after Stealth Rock chip with Raging Fury in sun and remove opposing entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Cinderace and Talonflame function as effective hazard removal options for Gouging Fire to break through teams without worrying about Stealth Rock or Spikes damage. Cinderace also functions as a decent pivot as well as a fast attacker alongside Gouging Fire, while Talonflame provides a Ground immunity. Ogerpon-H deals with annoying Water-types like Primarina and Quagsire to let Gouging Fire spam its devastating Raging Fury. Heatran provides Stealth Rock support to wear down foes like Swampert while dealing with Flutter Mane, which is a major threat to Gouging Fire. Ceruledge can pick off Flutter Mane as well as switch in on IronPress Zamazenta to shut it down. Volcarona functions well alongside Gouging Fire, as the two hit very hard on their respective attacking spectrums. Volcarona also does well against IronPress Zamazenta while easing matchups versus types like Fighting, Poison, Water, and Ground thanks to its varied coverage. Dragon Claw may be used instead of Earthquake to threaten Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, Garchomp, and Latias; however, Gouging Fire will be walled by the aforementioned targets of Earthquake—especially Heatran. An alternative EV spread of 88 HP / 168 Atk / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Gouging Fire to get a Speed boost under sun; this allows Gouging Fire to outspeed and take out threats like Flutter Mane and Choice Scarf Roaring Moon after a Dragon Dance while under sun. Gouging Fire at +1 while under sun still OHKOes Gliscor. However, the downside of this option is the inability to wallbreak effectively, notably needing to use Earthquake to 1v1 Toxapex."

  "Granbull": {
    "name": "Granbull",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 4-5 points Overview: Granbull is an inexpensive bulky Fairy-type, making it a decent option late into a draft if one is needed. Its Attack stat allows it to hit decently hard, and it has a couple of good utility moves that help it force progress as well. However, it lacks good natural bulk, relying on Intimidate for physical bulk and sometimes Assault Vest for special bulk. Fairy-type Pokemon often need to be brought to check Dragon- and Dark-types, and they are often characterized by their above-average special bulk paired with reliable recovery. Therefore, it's usually easier to draft better Fairy-types than Granbull because they provide more to the team. Defensive Utility: Granbull can utilize moves such as Thunder Wave and Super Fang to force progress in most matchups. It can also commonly fit two utility moves onto a moveset, since Play Rough pairs nicely with moves such as Earthquake and Close Combat in terms of coverage. Bulky Attacker: Granbull can leverage Assault Vest to increase its special bulk, and it can use its plethora of coverage options to fill out a moveset. Intimidate covers its lack of physical bulk, letting it switch into most threats. Wallbreaker: Boosting items such as Choice Band can increase Granbull's already great Attack even further, and combined with its excellent coverage options, it can sometimes function as a slower wallbreaker. Primary STAB Moves: Play Rough Setup Moves: Bulk Up, Trailblaze Utility Moves: Thunder Wave, Super Fang, Roar, Taunt, Encore, Rest, Sleep Talk, Brick Break Coverage: Earthquake, Close Combat, Ice Punch, Fire Punch, Wild Charge, Stone Edge, Rock Slide, Crunch, Psychic Fangs Counter: Counter can force surprise damage in matchups where Granbull is needed to check a physical attacker, but it doesn't quite have the damage to 1v1 most foes. This option is notably good on Assault Vest and Resistance Berry sets. Body Slam / Rock Tomb / Bulldoze: Body Slam, Rock Tomb, and Bulldoze are best used on Assault Vest sets in lieu of Thunder Wave to give Granbull another form of speed control. Protect: Protect can help provide Granbull some extra Leftovers recovery and let it scout out moves from foes. Endeavor: Endeavor is notably useful on Assault Vest sets as a good option against foes with high HP stats and for Granbull to trade favorably. Endure: Endure is a good move to pair with specific items such as Custap Berry to ensure it triggers and Rocky Helmet for extra chip damage. Charm: Charm is a decent option against physical attackers, notably ones with setup moves such as Dragon Dance and Bulk Up, to outpace their setup. Leftovers: Granbull often appreciates the longevity from Leftovers, given that its primary role is as a defensive piece and that it does not get a reliable recovery move. Sitrus Berry: Sitrus Berry has a similar purpose to Leftovers, but it is more useful in fast-paced matches. Heavy-Duty Boots: Avoiding entry hazard damage, notably from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, can be crucial for Granbull in matchups where it needs to regularly pivot around, making Heavy-Duty Boots a valuable item. Assault Vest: Assault Vest is a good item to run if Granbull is going to need to check special attackers. Its wide array of coverage moves help it fill out its moveset even without status moves. Rocky Helmet: The extra chip damage from Rocky Helmet can be quite useful in punishing weak and resisted hits such as Knock Off and U-turn. Choice Band: Choice Band leverages Granbull's solid Attack stat and wide coverage to threaten switch-ins and slower Pokemon that may not be able to take multiple hits from it. Resistance Berries: Resistance Berries are useful if there are specific moves Granbull needs to take, especially if it can respond with super effective coverage. Custap Berry: Granbull can often naturally activate Custap Berry, and it can throw out moves such as Thunder Wave and Endeavor to turn the tide of the match. It can also use Endure to survive an attack, activate Custap Berry, and strike back with a powerful attack. Eject Button: The extra momentum from Eject Button could be quite useful in certain matchups, especially when Granbull might be too passive against an opposing threat. Red Card: Granbull can use Red Card in matchups where opponents have threatening setup sweepers that need to be forced out. This item is often paired with Endure to ensure the Red Card activates. Air Balloon: Air Balloon is notably useful against Dragon-types such as Garchomp that may be unable to hit Granbull with immunities to both Dragon and Ground. It can also be nice on a team that is particularly weak to Ground. Granbull should not be a Tera Captain. The primary reason to draft it is due to its Fairy typing, and it doesn't have the stats to take advantage of Tera. Also, it already has a wide array of coverage, so there isn't much reason to Tera offensively. If for some reason it is a Tera Captain, it could Tera to resist a hit from an opposing threat on a key turn to win a 1v1, or gain STAB on a coverage move to meet a certain damage threshold. Tera Types such as Tera Steel and Water are useful defensively, while Tera Ground, Dark, and Fighting can be used offensively. Granbull is primarily drafted on teams that need a Fairy-type late into the draft. It often doesn't have the stats or utility of other Pokemon around its price range outside of its typing. It has a strong movepool, making it a usable pick, but it should really only be picked if the draft needs a Fairy-type. Special Walls: Granbull is often more useful at checking physical attackers due to Intimidate, so having a specially defensive teammate is quite helpful. Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Ting-Lu, and Latias all fill this role well. Fast Late-game Sweepers: Granbull is able to rack up chip damage with its coverage moves and Super Fang as well as provide speed control with Thunder Wave. These traits let it enable powerful offensive teammates such as Greninja, Ogerpon, and Sneasler, which often require this level of support to sweep late-game. Pivots: Having teammates that also want to pivot can help Granbull cycle Intimidate, and it can enable more offensive Granbull sets by taking the pressure off of it to pivot and by bringing it in safely. Pokemon such as Raging Bolt, Rotom-W, and Slowking are effective at this role. Special Attackers: Granbull often struggles to check opposing special attackers reliably. Even with Assault Vest, it still suffers a lot from chip damage and has no way of getting its HP back on its own. Pokemon such as Enamorus, Gholdengo, and Tornadus-T can be troublesome for Granbull. Defensive Resists with Reliable Recovery: Granbull can provide decent enough damage output, but it struggles against bulkier foes with reliable recovery that can chip it down slowly and win the 1v1. Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking, Skeledirge, and Pecharunt can all effectively 1v1 Granbull, and they can sometimes even punish it with their own setup. Entry Hazards: Granbull wants to be switching in often to take advantage of Intimidate, but it also needs Leftovers to have some form of reliable recovery. Entry hazards can wear it down quickly and force it to run Heavy-Duty Boots, cutting down its longevity. Status Ailments: Granbull is very annoyed by all status ailments, given its lack of reliable recovery and its role as a defensive Pokemon. Toxic Spikes in particular can be problematic, forcing Granbull to run Heavy-Duty Boots more than it wants to."

    "text": "Bulk Up Great Tusk with Booster Energy's Speed boost is a potent physical setup sweeper that is capable of providing valuable utility to its team, as its access to Rapid Spin and its natural bulk allows it to check key threats such as Dragonite and Kingambit. Bulk Up leverages Great Tusk's natural bulk to give it setup opportunities against many of the common physical attackers in the tier, such as Kingambit and Zamazenta. Headlong Rush is a brutally powerful option for a Ground-type STAB move and is not weakened by Grassy Terrain. Alternatively, Earthquake can be run if Headlong Rush's low PP and Defense drops prove to be problematic, but misses out on benchmarks like the potential OHKO on Dragapult and Iron Valiant at +1. Ice Spinner allows Great Tusk to hit Grass- and Flying-types such as Serperior, Gliscor, and Enamorus for super effective damage, which would otherwise wall it or force it out. The last moveslot can be Rapid Spin, which lets it remove hazards and provides it with further boosts to its Speed, preventing otherwise faster threats like Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Iron Valiant from revenge killing it; Close Combat for a strong Fighting-type STAB move, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulky Kingambit, threatening huge damage on Ting-Lu, and punishing switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight with heavy damage; or Knock Off, which deals with Air Balloon Gholdengo as well as crippling its checks like Dondozo. The EV spread listed is necessary for Great Tusk to attain a Speed boost from Protosynthesis from Booster Energy; however, Leftovers can be used instead should Great Tusk be used on sun. Tera Poison is the premier defensive Tera type for Great Tusk, allowing it to set up on Gliscor's Toxic and completely wall Rillaboom and Zamazenta alongside avoiding a KO and thus granting it an extra turn against Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Conversely, Tera Ice is a strong choice for an offensive Tera type that provides Great Tusk with STAB on Ice Spinner, which can net OHKOs on Gliscor and offensive Zapdos after a boost from Bulk Up. Tera Steel can also be considered as an alternative to Tera Poison that also lets Great Tusk wall Choice Band Dragapult and Dragon Dance Kyurem, at the cost of being weaker into Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Low Kick Kingambit. Additionally, both Tera Ice and Steel provides an Ice resistance against foes like Weavile and Meowscarada. Great Tusk is commonly seen on offense, hyper offense, and sun structures, which appreciate its entry hazard control and ability to clean teams in late-game scenarios. Great Tusk particularly struggles against physical walls such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Dondozo. On sun teams, strong special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake can easily force these Pokemon out and can soften up the opposing team for Great Tusk to sweep in the mid- or late-game. In return, Great Tusk provides key hazard control and switches into powerful physical threats such as Kingambit. Additionally, it can easily shatter common checks to both Walking Wake and Raging Bolt, particularly Clodsire and Galarian Slowking. Hatterene on sun teams and Choice Scarf Enamorus on weatherless offense can support Great Tusk with Healing Wish and can threaten some of its checks, notably Gliscor, Deoxys-S, and Zamazenta. Hatterene also alleviates the need for Great Tusk to run Rapid Spin, freeing up the last moveslot for more offensively oriented options such as Close Combat and Knock Off. Outside of sun, Rillaboom provides Great Tusk with passive recovery without relying on Leftovers and can force out or KO the likes of Primarina and Dondozo. In return, Great Tusk can act as a mid- or late-game sweeper once the opposing team is sufficiently weakened and can threaten Pokemon such as Dragonite that Rillaboom struggles against. Dragonite appreciates the utility of Great Tusk's Rapid Spin and its ability to consistently threaten Skeledirge. In exchange, Dragonite can handle opposing Ogerpon-W. Lastly, Kingambit enjoys having Great Tusk beating its checks like opposing Great Tusk one-to-one with its own setup, allowing it to more easily sweep late-game. Great Tusk is a great Pokemon in the OU metagame due to its role compression, entry hazard removal, offensive and defensive typing, and bulk, enabling it to check a variety of top-tier threats like Kingambit, Gliscor, and Gholdengo. It is the best hazard remover in the tier and can threaten common hazard setters and spinblockers such as Landorus-T, Glimmora, and Dragapult. Headlong Rush OHKOes offensive Kingambit and is not weakened under Grassy Terrain unlike Earthquake. Do be aware of the drawbacks though; lowering both of Great Tusk's defenses opens it up to an OHKO from Weavile's Triple Axel. Ice Spinner hits Flying-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Hydrapple. Knock Off disrupts foes that switch in and makes progress by removing items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots. Temper Flare can be used over this to ease prediction against Air Balloon Gholdengo. If it attempts to block Rapid Spin, Temper Flare's power doubles next turn, enabling Great Tusk to OHKO it. Temper Flare also serves as strong coverage in general if used under sun. Rapid Spin provides hazard removal while boosting Great Tusk's Speed. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Great Tusk's job of removing hazards easier, as it ignores the chip damage as well as the Speed drop from Sticky Web, allowing it to switch in more times to make progress. Leftovers is an alternative option, giving Great Tusk healing over time. However, it leaves Great Tusk weak to hazard chip, potentially resulting in it taking massive damage on switch-in and being poisoned. Booster Energy can be used on more offensive teams that care less about longevity, making it easier for Great Tusk to remove hazards thanks to its stronger offensive presence. This EV spread gives it an Attack boost in sun or when running Booster Energy. Tera Ground powers up Headlong Rush, allowing it to OHKO maximum Defense Gholdengo, and it also keeps Great Tusk's Electric immunity. Tera Steel can help Great Tusk check Gliscor by providing it with an immunity to Toxic, and it can 2HKO Gliscor with Ice Spinner without being chipped. Tera Steel gives Great Tusk a multitude of resistances that were prior weaknesses, like Fairy, Psychic, Grass, and Ice, which helps it to check Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Weavile. Tera Fire also gives it notable resistances to Fairy, checking Iron Valiant, and Grass, resisting Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. It also provides a burn immunity, which helps check Cinderace. Great Tusk works well on offensive structures due to its entry hazard removal capabilities, which can help teammates weak to them come in more easily; it also guarantees progress with Knock Off. If used on sun teams, Great Tusk helps support the Stealth Rock-weak Torkoal, enabling it to switch in and set sun more times, as well as being a potent wallbreaker itself with the power boost it gets in the sun. Great Tusk pairs well with Choice-locked wallbreakers and Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Enamorus and Kyurem, as they appreciate the hazard removal so they can switch in more reliably. Great Tusk also pairs well with Kingambit, as the hazard removal lets it run Leftovers for more longevity or an offensive item like Black Glasses to hit harder. Ogerpon-W is a good partner for Great Tusk, as it provides a Water immunity and benefits from Great Tusk's hazard removal to switch in more frequently. In return, Great Tusk's Ice Spinner threatens the Dragon-types that Ogerpon-W struggles with. Great Tusk is generally weak to special attackers thanks to its measly Special Defense. Partners like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Primarina can patch up this weakness by checking special threats like Iron Valiant, and their typings synergize well with Great Tusk. In return, Great Tusk's hazard removal lets them wall these threats more consistently. Thanks to its gargantuan Defense in tandem with a plethora of utility options and a great defensive typing, Great Tusk makes for a premier defensive presence, checking notable threats like Kingambit and Dragonite. Stealth Rock, in tandem with Rapid Spin, makes Great Tusk a dominant choice for entry hazard control, being able to threaten Pokemon immune to Rapid Spin like Gholdengo and Dragapult with Earthquake or Knock Off while also being able to set up Stealth Rock in the face of aforementioned physical threats. Alternatively, Bulk Up makes Great Tusk more consistently able to check foes like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Iron Boulder, Choice Band Zamazenta, and especially Kingambit. Knock Off punishes common switch ins like Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Zapdos and breaks through Ghost-types like Dragapult. Alternatively, Ice Spinner provides solid coverage for Flying- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Enamorus, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 36 Speed EVs lets Great Tusk outspeed Jolly maximum Speed Kingambit. Tera Water provides Great Tusk means of resisting Water-type attacks from the likes of Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott while also removing its weaknesses to Fairy and Flying. Alternatively, Tera Steel turns its weaknesses to Grass and Ice into resistances, giving Great Tusk stronger utility against the likes of Meowscarada, Serperior, and Rillaboom. Leftovers gives Great Tusk better longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots bolsters Great Tusk's role as hazard control. Great Tusk fits best on balance and bulky offense teams as a premier choice for entry hazard control, in addition to acting as a strong check towards the likes of Kingambit and Dragonite. Pokemon that heavily benefit from hazard removal, namely Raging Bolt and Ogerpon-W, heavily appreciate Great Tusk's capability of shedding entry hazards with ease while being able to take advantage of the Water- and Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Great Tusk. Air Balloon Gholdengo poses a major threat to Great Tusk without Knock Off, as it can otherwise switch in with ease and overwhelm Great Tusk with Shadow Ball. As a result, Kingambit makes for a solid partner to Great Tusk thanks to its strong ability to check non-Focus Blast Gholdengo, as well as Serperior, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Defensive Great Tusk also doubles as a solid Kingambit answer, meaning that Pokemon that would otherwise be overwhelmed by Kingambit such as Dragapult and Gholdengo make for solid partners. The latter also blocks attempts at removing Stealth Rock from the likes of Corviknight and opposing Great Tusk."

    "text": "With its wide coverage combined with its excellent ability Protean, Choice Specs Greninja is a scary wallbreaker that hits all of the metagame at least neutrally while outspeeding common offensive Pokemon such as Latios and Ogerpon-C. Surf is the best option to deal strong damage, as Hydro Pump can unfortunately miss and lacks PP. However, Hydro Pump could still be an option to inflict more damage, as it can OHKO defensive Excadrill and 2HKO defensive Tyranitar and Tinkaton, though Surf deals with these Pokemon with entry hazards anyway. Ice Beam is able to hit Tornadus-T, Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Ogerpon-C super effectively, whereas Sludge Wave can surprise common switch-ins like Azumarill and Keldeo and gives Greninja a resistance to Fighting-type moves, such as Secret Sword, allowing it to 2HKO Keldeo. Spikes chips the opposing team in the long term and punishes switch-ins, helping Greninja and its teammates clean more easily. Greninja naturally finds some good opportunities to set up a layer of Spikes or two thanks to the switches it naturally forces. U-turn is an alternative that grants Greninja some momentum, allowing it to pivot out on Pokemon that can wall it such as Empoleon, Gastrodon, and Toxapex. Tera Water is preferred to boost the power of Greninja's Water-type move, guaranteeing an OHKO on Scizor and Cobalion with Surf and a 2HKO on Keldeo with Hydro Pump, although it shouldn't Terastallize outside of an emergency because it'll lose the boost of Protean. Due to its severe frailty and incapacity to switch in easily, Greninja fits well on bulky offense teams that can afford slow VoltTurn support to bring it safely into battle, and they also provide some defensive backbones for Greninja to rely on. Teammates such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Slowking are thus very appreciated. Zapdos is also a strong answer to Azumarill, while Slowking can be useful to pressure Toxapex and Gastrodon with Future Sight. Excadrill is a helpful partner that can help Greninja by crushing common Water-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-W, allowing Greninja to spam its Water-type move. Also, Excadrill is capable of removing entry hazards, which can be a little overwhelming for Greninja. In the same way, Knock Off support helps Greninja by removing crucial items such as Assault Vest on Tornadus-T and Heavy-Duty Boots on Slowking and Volcanion. Examples of users would be Tornadus-T and Tinkaton. Since Greninja causes a lot of switches, hazard setters like Sandy Shocks and Cobalion are helpful. Cobalion can also check the powerful Lokix. Lastly, offensive teammates such as Calm Mind Latios and Comfey like the opposing team weakened by Greninja's powerful moves so that they can clean up, while others such as Ogerpon-C and Lokix can overwhelm their shared checks with Choice Specs Greninja, with examples of these being Toxapex, Tinkaton, and Empoleon. Battle Bond turns Greninja into one of UU’s deadliest sweepers and revenge killers, as simply getting just one KO alone grants Greninja significant boosts in Special Attack and Speed to become a very difficult-to-wall sweeper that also avoids revenge killing attempts barring priority. Hydro Pump is an option over Surf for greater power, but Surf’s accuracy is much more desirable due to Greninja’s frailty and Hydro Pump's potential to be punished via a miss. Ice Beam allows Greninja to take down Hydrapple, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos. Sludge Wave is a more specific option that helps versus Azumarill, and it hits Quaquaval for neutral damage. Extrasensory is an option for the third moveslot to nail checks like Okidogi, Quaquaval, and Toxapex. Protect allows Greninja to block First Impression from Lokix and scout attacks from Choice item users such as Latios and Okidogi. It also can scout reactive Terastallizations from foes like Skeledirge and Tornadus-T. Water Shuriken allows Greninja to pick off faster targets like Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Mienshao as well as beating out priority moves from Scizor and Mamoswine and KOing them when they are at low health. Life Orb is key in granting Greninja the power needed to break past foes such as Rotom-W, Slowking, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T despite reducing Greninja's limited longevity. Tera Water removes Greninja’s weakness to Fighting-type moves and gives it a permanently stronger Surf. Tera Stellar gives all of Greninja's moves extra power to take down Assault Vest Tornadus-T, Tera Steel Hydrapple, and Rotom-W late-game, and it gives Greninja a good shot at taking down Sand Rush Excadrill with Water Shuriken. Greninja best fits on offensive teams and is best supported by teammates that can weaken its checks and counters so that it can have an easier time cleaning up. Latios acts as a secondary wallbreaker, which can force critical damage on foes such as Skeledirge and Toxapex as well as overwhelmed shared checks like Azumarill and Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Mamoswine and Ogerpon-C similarly can punch holes into the opposing team by taking down the likes of Skeledirge and Mandibuzz, and they can wear down checks like Hydrapple for Greninja to clean late-game. Knock Off support from Tinkaton, Tornadus-T, and Ogerpon can cripple checks such as Slowking, Rotom-W, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T to bring them into KO range of Greninja's attacks. Strong Electric-types such as Zapdos and Thundurus-T are essential in punching holes through Water-types such as Keldeo and Azumarill that give Greninja trouble. The former also checks Lokix and can hinder revenge killers like Ogerpon and Okidogi with Static. Entry hazard support is key in putting foes such as Tinkaton, Rotom-W, and Toxapex into KO range, making hazard setters like Sandy Shocks, your own Tinkaton, and Cobalion valuable teammates. Sandy Shocks pressures Tornadus-T and Zapdos, while Tinkaton and Cobalion can punish revenge killers like Ogerpon, Choice Scarf Hoopa-U, and Lokix if Greninja lacks Protect. Cobalion also can bring Greninja in with Volt Switch against Hydrapple and Zapdos to wallbreak while crippling Tornadus-T with Thunder Wave. Excadrill can remove hazards to avoid worsening the damage Greninja takes from Life Orb, and it offensively handles Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Empoleon while also swapping into Tinkaton."

    "text": "Using its high Speed, synergistic offensive typing, and high offensive stats, Ash-Greninja becomes a strong wallbreaker. With Flower Trick, Ash-Greninja can dent Fur Coat Slowbro without activating Rocky Helmet, OHKO Mega Swampert, and 2HKO Imposter users. Frost Breath lets Ash-Greninja OHKO Mega Garchomp and severely weaken Fur Coat Miraidon and Yveltal. Physically strong Pokemon like Mega Garchomp, Mega Lucario, and Kyurem-B appreciate Ash-Greninja's presence, as it's able to help overwhelm their checks such as Fur Coat Arceus-Ghost, Ho-Oh, and Mega Slowbro; Mega Lucario is particularly useful thanks to its strong matchup against Fur Coat Fairy-types like Mega Audino, which otherwise completely wall Ash-Greninja thanks to Rocky Helmet. Ash-Greninja can struggle against faster Pokemon such as Flutter Mane and Miraidon, as these are are all able to revenge kill it, so having teammates like Mega Steelix, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground helps. Ash-Greninja also benefits immensely from having teammates that can block Strength Sap such as Mega Audino, Blissey, and Mega Slowbro, as many of its defensive checks like Miraidon and Arceus-Fairy rely on this move for healing. Having slow pivots, such as Teleport users like Mega Audino or RegenVest users like Mega Swampert, is also helpful to account for its frailty. To Imposter-proof Ash-Greninja, a Fur Coat + Rocky Helmet user like Mega Audino is ideal. Ash-Greninja utilizes its strong mixed attacking stats, decent offensive typing for Sheer Force, and good Speed to be a terrifying wallbreaker. Noxious Torque is the most consistent option to heavily dent Ice Scales Fairy-types such as Mega Audino and Arceus-Fairy. Bolt Strike hits Primal Kyogre, RegenVest Celesteela, and Imposter users; Combat Torque can be used instead to hit Dialga-O while still being decently powerful against the aforementioned targets. Certain wallbreakers like Mega Garchomp appreciate Ash-Greninja's unpredictability, as Ash-Greninja can lure in potential checks like Fur Coat Arceus-Fairy and heavily damage them for said wallbreakers. Ash-Greninja particularly struggles with breaking through RegenVest Dialga-O with Bolt Strike or Ice Scales Yveltal with Combat Torque, so Knock Off users such as RegenVest Primal Kyogre work well with it. RegenVest Primal Kyogre can also remove Assault Vest from the likes of Celesteela if Ash-Greninja doesn't run Bolt Strike. Ash-Greninja also dislikes faster wallbreakers such as Flutter Mane and Mega Sceptile, so solid checks to them like Ice Scales Mega Audino, Arceus-Fairy, and Meloetta is recommended. Imposter-proof Ash-Greninja with your own RegenVest Dialga-O or an Ice Scales + Strength Sap Arceus forme that is neutral to its STAB moves such as Arceus-Fairy."

    "text": "Thanks to a solid typing with one weakness and good defensive stats, Alolan Grimer is able to use Knock Offs consistently throughout a game, weakening the opposing team for its teammates to take advantage of. Gunk Shot is used to hit Pokemon that have already been hit by Knock Off, while Drain Punch OHKOs Pawniard and provides some recovery to increase Grimer's longevity. Drain Punch also allows it to damage other Alolan Grimer neutrally, making it valuable in matchups against opposing Alolan Grimer. Sleep Talk can be used to make Alolan Grimer a great Foongus check and sleep absorber for the team, while Memento gives sweeper teammates a chance to set up. Imprison, together with a bit of Speed investment, lets Alolan Grimer completely shut down opposing Alolan Grimer. Tera Grass eliminates Grimer's only weakness to Ground and lets it take on opposing Hisuian Voltorb more easily. Alolan Grimer is forced out by Ground-types like Mudbray, Numel, and opposing Toedscool, so checks to those Pokemon like Drifloon, Toedscool, and Shellos are essential. Alolan Grimer pairs well with offensive sweepers like Unburden Shroodle, Shellder, and Numel, which can sweep more easily due to Alolan Grimer weakening the enemy team with Knock Off. Grookey is a good partner as well, since Grassy Terrain gives Alolan Grimer much appreciated passive recovery and cuts damage from Earthquake in half, while Alolan Grimer's Knock Off makes switching into Grookey's Wood Hammer much harder. Volt Switch users like Hisuian Voltorb and Wattrel can help get Alolan Grimer in safely, and they can help pressure and overwhelm Ground-types for each other."

  "Grimmsnarl": {
    "name": "Grimmsnarl",
    "text": "Sample set. Stay tuned for updates! Grimmsnarl is a threatening sweeper thanks to its ability to set up and use Substitute with priority because of Prankster. Thanks to its ability, Grimmsnarl can invest fully in its bulk, allowing it to take multiple hits before fainting. Grimmsnarl's STAB combination is also difficult to switch into, as it's unresisted by the entire tier. Sucker Punch helps Grimmsnarl pick off fast frail Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Salazzle. Substitute allows it to take advantage of walls like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Bellibolt, letting it ignore status and set up freely. On top of this, it also helps Grimmsnarl scout Choice-locked Pokemon like Florges and Duraludon. Tera Steel grants it a resistance to Fairy-type attacks, as well as gaining a multitude of other resistances, notably helping Grimmsnarl versus Toxtricity's Boomburst, Staraptor's Brave Bird, and Bronzong's Heavy Slam. Similarly, Tera Poison helps Grimmsnarl take on Fairy-type attacks from Florges, but it trades Tera Steel's wide array of resistances for a resistance to common Fighting-type attacks from faster Pokemon like Heracross and Flamigo. However, it now has to deal with super effective Psychic Noise from both Scream Tail and Florges. Due to having to rely on Sucker Punch to hit Steel-types like Alolan Sandslash, Grimmsnarl commonly struggles against them; because of this, Grimmsnarl appreciates teammates that can pressure them like Salazzle, Delphox, and Golurk. Grimmsnarl's Substitute is easily broken by powerful wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-F and Staraptor, or it can be ignored by Toxtricity. So, Milotic, Bellibolt, and Bronzong make for great partners, being able to check these strong offensive threats. Grimmsnarl easily takes advantage of and sets up against special attacking walls like Gastrodon and Bellibolt. In order to get Grimmsnarl in against these Pokemon, it must be paired with teammates that force these walls in and can pivot like Grafaiai and Flamigo. Grimmsnarl, due to being slow and having to rely on Sucker Punch to take care of faster threats, likes to have cleaners alongside it such as Choice Scarf users like Staraptor, Rotom-C, and Bruxish to finish up games after it's beaten the bulkier Pokemon. Grimmsnarl also struggles with sweeping early-game, so wallbreakers like Meloetta, Paldean Tauros-F, and Hariyama pair well to overwhelm shared checks such as Coalossal, Mudsdale, and Qwilfish. Scream Tail and Florges are both annoyances for Grimmsnarl, as they can both lock it into a move with Encore and Trick, respectively. In order to deal with these threats, partners like Skuntank, Salazzle, and Toxtricity work well in tandem with Grimmsnarl."

  "Groudon": {
    "name": "Groudon",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Groudon's titanic physical bulk, strong support movepool that includes Will-O-Wisp, Stealth Rock, and Spikes, and good defensive typing make it a solid physically defensive option against common threats like Zacian-C and Koraidon; it is also able to run Stealth Rock and Spikes on the same set, offering good role compression. It is no slouch offensively either, as even defensive sets can put out solid damage with its great base Attack and Precipice Blades, which wallbreaking sets take even further with Swords Dance. However, Groudon often struggles to find a niche on teams, as it is often left on the sidelines in favor of Arceus-Ground, which has recovery and better special bulk, Landorus-T and Gliscor, which have better abilities and typing and U-turn, and Ting-Lu, which can better check Miraidon. Offensive sets, while still immensely powerful, compete heavily with Koraidon and Arceus-Ground, which boast better Speed, Taunt, in Arceus-Ground's case, Recover, and in Koraidon's case, better power. Groudon can still find a niche with its excellent bulk, ability to run both Stealth Rock and Spikes on the same set, and damage output, but that niche is often dependent on the team already using a different Arceus forme and Koraidon being too busy to run Swords Dance. Precipice Blades versus Earthquake is the eternal question between power and accuracy; Precipice Blades picks up the OHKO on Miraidon and Zacian-C, the latter of which Groudon is often tasked with checking, while Earthquake still does solid damage without missing. Stealth Rock is the most common choice in the third moveslot, as it lets Groudon set both Stealth Rock and Spikes for its team. Protect is a viable option if a teammate already provides Stealth Rock, as it helps make up for Groudon's lack of reliable recovery and scout common Choice item users like Miraidon and Koraidon. Will-O-Wisp cripples the physical threats Groudon is tasked with handling like Koraidon and Zacian-C while also annoying any non-burn-immune foe looking to switch in, while Roar has excellent synergy with Stealth Rock and Spikes and can remove a dangerous setup sweeper like Calm Mind Arceus-Ground in an emergency. 16 Speed EVs get the jump on uninvested Landorus-T, letting Groudon land a Will-O-Wisp or extra layer of hazards, as well as uninvested Kyogre. Tera Fairy's Dragon immunity can block Koraidon from getting a Speed boost with Scale Shot and potentially lets Groudon snipe Miraidon going for the KO, while Tera Water is an overall excellent defensive type that specifically checks Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade and Calyrex-I's Glacial Lance. Groudon's ability to set both Stealth Rock and Spikes in a single teamslot makes it well suited for offensive teammates like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Zacian-C, as they are often able to break through their checks with that extra chip damage. Groudon also pairs well with offensive Arceus formes, as it can provide some of the extra physical bulk they often do instead. Special attackers, chiefly Miraidon and Kyogre, can easily overwhelm Groudon, making specially defensive teammates in Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy excellent options; it is worth mentioning that Groudon teams often struggle into Miraidon, as Groudon is a Ground-type that does not answer Miraidon. Speaking of Ho-Oh, this Groudon set is literally unable to touch it, making a consistent answer like Arceus-Water necessary. Groudon can also struggle into a few specific physical attackers, chiefly Calyrex-I and Zacian-C long-term, so secondary answers to them like a revenge killer or Kyogre in Calyrex-I's case are strongly recommended. Precipice Blades is chosen over Earthquake for its better power, namely OHKOing offensive variants of Arceus and having a good chance to OHKO 252 HP / 0 Def variants after a Swords Dance. Stone Edge is mandatory to hit Ho-Oh and other Ground-immune Pokemon like Gliscor and Giratina-O. Speaking of Gliscor, Substitute in conjunction with 44 Speed EVs lets Groudon turn Gliscor into setup fodder, blocking Toxic and taking next to no damage from U-turn. If Gliscor is not a concern, Heat Crash is a perfectly accurate option that also provides coverage for Tera Steel Giratina, Tera Grass Ho-Oh, Orthworm, and Corviknight. Tera Fairy lets Groudon check Koraidon and Miraidon in a pinch, Tera Ground lets +2 Precipice Blades secure the OHKO against even physically defensive Arceus, and Tera Fire can block an expected Will-O-Wisp and power up Heat Crash if used. Swords Dance Groudon is an excellent wallbreaker, so it pairs very well with Koraidon and Zacian-C, as they can go to town once Groudon weakens or removes their shared checks. Groudon loves to be brought in on foes it can set up on like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Necrozma-DM, so pivots like Koraidon are very much appreciated. Groudon is still quite slow and vulnerable to revenge killers, especially specially offensive ones like Miraidon and Kyogre, so specially defensive teammates like Arceus-Fairy are welcome. Spikes setters like Glimmora and Deoxys-S help Groudon secure OHKOes against defensive Arceus formes. Miraidon is an excellent teammate to pressure Kyogre and Arceus-Water and appreciates Power Herb-free Solar Beam and Groudon pressuring Arceus-Ground. Defensive Groudon can consider a few other item choices, such as Rocky Helmet to punish U-turn, but it generally prefers the recovery from Leftovers. Offensive Groudon can consider more or even maximum Speed investment to get the jump on Kyogre, other Groudon, and Necrozma-DM, but it generally prefers the extra bulk to trade hits more reliably. Defensive Arceus Formes: Physically defensive Arceus-Water, -Fairy, and -Ground can more or less wall Groudon forever and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp. Opposing Spikes Users: Groudon is reliant on Leftovers to have any form of recovery and relies on its bulk to check threats or set up, so opposing Spikes users like Gliscor dramatically reduce its effectiveness. Calyrex-I: Calyrex-I can take any one hit and KO back with Glacial Lance; Groudon's best option is often Will-O-Wisp, but that can be ruined by an untimely Tera Fire. Calyrex-I still has to be wary of Groudon's Tera Water. Special Attackers: Special attackers in general, and especially Kyogre, can take advantage of Groudon's weaker Special Defense and force it out. Most, however, do not appreciate switching into Precipice Blades. Ho-Oh and Gliscor: Defensive Groudon sets are often utterly unable to touch Ho-Oh and Gliscor, so once the set is scouted, they can freely switch in to recover HP or set hazards. Offensive sets can effectively deal with them, though, so they cannot switch in freely."

    "text": "Hisuian Growlithe serves as a potent wallbreaker with a Choice Scarf. Its ability to spam high-Base Power moves makes it a difficult Pokemon to switch into, often forcing guessing games between Flare Blitz and Head Smash. Psychic Fangs deters more reliable switch-ins to Hisuian Growlithe's STAB moves, hitting Mienfoo and Mareanie. Psychic Fangs also has the additional benefit of breaking screens, something that may hinder Hisuian Growlithe's wallbreaking. The final slot is flexible, with Rock Blast offering a lower-power alternative to Head Smash, with better accuracy and more PP that also beats Terastalized Weak Armor Vullaby. Stealth Rock allows Growlithe to provide role compression to offensive teams through offering entry hazard support, while Sleep Talk lets it sponge Spore from Foongus and still pose a threat. Tera Fire provides a stronger Flare Blitz to power through other bulky checks like Mudbray and the aforementioned Mienfoo. Much like many other wallbreakers in the tier, Hisuian Growlithe prefers having hazards off the field as much as possible. Defog and Rapid Spin users such as Vullaby and Toedscool enable it to get in frequently, with the former also able to provide pivoting support and the latter providing Spore support. Mienfoo is another good teammate, as it can tank opposing Hisuian Growlithe's attacks and pivot your own in. Partners like Gastly and Gothita also provide offensive synergy, being able to pressure checks such as Mareanie and Glimmet. Eviolite Hisuian Growlithe is an amazing wallbreaker that trades the immediate speed of Choice Scarf sets for more utility options and the ability to switch moves, boasting powerful attacks that can 2HKO almost any foe without the drawback of recoil. Stealth Rock helps rack up passive damage on opposing Pokemon, while Flame Charge is sometimes chosen for a more offensive approach to make up for Hisuian Growlithe's middling Speed. Will-O-Wisp helps punish common switch-ins like Mienfoo and Mudbray, while Substitute is a safe way to scout for switches and catch Sucker Punch from opposing Pawniard and Stunky. Tera Fire boosts Flare Blitz's damage, allowing it to 2HKO offensive Mudbray, and removes Hisuian Growlithe's weakness to Fighting, while Tera Flying turns Hisuian Growlithe's weaknesses to Ground and Fighting into resistances. Hisuian Growlithe enjoys VoltTurn support from teammates such as Mienfoo and Hisuian Voltorb, which in turn enjoy Hisuian Growlithe's ability to nuke Pokemon like Foongus and Pawniard. Landing a Will-O-Wisp on prominent physical attackers like Mienfoo and Mudbray is greatly appreciated by setup sweepers such as Shellder, which appreciate not taking as much damage on setup turns. Hisuian Growlithe struggles with Pokemon that can resist its STAB moves and KO it back such as Mienfoo and Glimmet, so it pairs well with trappers like Gothita and Trapinch that can remove them."

    "text": "Mega Gyarados is a strong offensive setup sweeper that matches up well into a variety of different teams. It finds itself as a staple on screens hyper offense hitting some notable speed benchmarks such as outspeeding +1 Iron Boulder and +1 Iron Valiant when at +2 Speed. Mold Breaker allows Mega Gyarados to break past Pokemon it otherwise can't, such as Dragonite and Unaware users. Taunt allows it to block status moves like Toxic and Whirlwind from foes like Toxapex and Skarmory. Alternatively, Substitute allows Mega Gyarados to set up on foes like Alomomola, Garganacl, and Gliscor, though it becomes more susceptible to phazing and being forced out by defensive Terastallization usage from foes like Corviknight more easily, which can use Iron Defense to beat Substitute variants. Intimidate is the preferred ability on base Gyarados to get off an Attack drop before Mega Evolving to ease setup against mons such as defensive Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott. Jolly is preferred over Adamant, as Mega Gyarados appreciates being able to outspeed Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Zamazenta, and Mega Lopunny at +1. Teammates such as Iron Boulder, Dragonite, Garchomp, and Great Tusk appreciate Mega Gyarados wearing down defensive walls such as Dondozo, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn while also being able to prevent their recovery with Taunt, allowing weaker physical attackers to clean up in the later stages of the game. Mega Gyarados is vulnerable to contact effects such as Static from defensive Zapdos and Rocky Helmet sets on Ferrothorn and Garchomp, as all its moves make contact, Rillaboom is also very threatening with its priority Grassy Glide being able to easily revenge Mega Gyarados, Zamazenta also poses a massive threat, being able to tank +1 boosted attacks and OHKO back with a Close Combat or Body Press. Some strong teammates to mitigate these are Tapu Koko which can provide screens support as well as set Electric Terrain, which prevents Dondozo from using Rest. Garchomp and Volcarona are also notable partners; the former switches into Zapdos, whereas the latter can set up on Ferrothorn, has a good defensive typing that allows it to switch into Fighting- and Fairy-type moves from the likes of Iron Valiant, and punishes Zamazenta and Rillaboom with Flame Body."

    "text": "With entry hazard control provided by Magic Bounce, solid defensive stats that combine with powerful offenses to grant it great matchups against Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, and the potential for it to set up and snowball out of control with Calm Mind while keeping itself healthy with Draining Kiss, Hatterene makes a great addition to offensive teams looking for a special sweeper and hazard control in one. Psyshock is a strong STAB option that allows for Hatterene to target specially defensive walls on their weaker side, allowing for it to break through Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire while dealing with opposing setup sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Tera Fairy Raging Bolt. Stored Power lacks the immediate power of Psyshock but can scale heavily with multiple Calm Minds to allow Hatterene to muscle past even Unaware targets like Skeledirge, Clodsire, and Dondozo, along with also helping to win the one-on-one against other special setup sweepers in a similar manner to Psyshock. Unfortunately, its STAB combination leaves Hatterene walled by common Steel-types like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Iron Treads, while the low base power of Draining Kiss allows for Kingambit to easily stomach a boosted hit. Mystical Fire is a great coverage option that targets Steel-types, in particular helping to weaken Gholdengo's attacks, although this leaves Hatterene unable to hit Heatran; Nuzzle can alternatively be used to spread paralysis onto common switch-ins like Kingambit, Gholdengo, Heatran, and Skeledirge. While Magic Bounce's primary utility comes from its ability to deny entry hazards, it also blocks disruptive moves like Encore from Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W and Taunt from Landorus-T and Heatran, along with status moves like Toxic from Gliscor and Clodsire; this makes it far more potent as a setup sweeper. Leftovers is Hatterene's best option to greatly improve its staying power along with allowing it to switch in multiple times over the course of a game to block hazards; on Grassy Terrain teams and particularly with Stored Power, Grassy Seed can be considered to give Hatterene a better chance at immediately sweeping at the expense of being worse at coming in repeatedly, though Leftovers is still a viable option on these builds. The given spread runs enough Speed EVs to outspeed Toxapex, allowing for Hatterene to use a boosted attack before Toxapex can remove its boosts with Haze, with the remaining EVs invested to maximize physical defense. This notably allows for Hatterene to live even a +1 Protosynthesis-boosted Knock Off from Roaring Moon, while also dodging the 2HKO from Cinderace's Pyro Ball. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature can be considered on Nuzzle variants of Hatterene, as the Speed is less necessary when it is able to paralyze foes and so more physical bulk can be invested; however, this notably makes Hatterene slower than offensive Kingambit even after paralysis. Tera Water is a great neutral defensive typing that grants Hatterene a resistance to Steel-type attacks from Kingambit and Gholdengo, along with allowing it to stay in on Water- and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon that now struggle to eliminate it like Dondozo and Iron Moth. Tera Fire also gives Hatterene a better matchup into Kingambit and Gholdengo while also giving it resistances to attacks from Rillaboom and powering up its coverage option on Mystical Fire sets. However, this comes at the expense of a weakness to Ground-type attacks from Great Tusk and Gliscor, along with making Hatterene much easier to revenge kill with strong Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake. Calm Mind Hatterene is a great pick on offense teams that appreciate the support against entry hazards, particularly for bulkier offense builds without a dedicated hazard setting lead. One particular form of bulky offense that Hatterene thrives on is Grassy Terrain with Rillaboom, with the additional passive recovery from the Terrain being much appreciated to help boost Hatterene's longevity further. In return, Hatterene can keep hazards clear from the field, allowing for teammates like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom itself to opt not to run Heavy-Duty Boots without fearing hazard damage racking up over time. Hatterene fits on far more than Terrain offense though, finding a home on even hyper offense teams alongside hazard setters like Glimmora, and some of its best partners on both bulky offense and hyper offense are offensive hazard-weak Pokemon that would sooner run a boosting item than Heavy-Duty Boots; prime examples of this are Raging Bolt and Roaring Moon. Though Hatterene has ways of dealing with some of its more problematic matchups, Kingambit and Gholdengo are always an issue for their ability to shrug off its STAB attacks and threaten it with their own; bulky, offensive switch-ins to the former like Great Tusk and Zamazenta can alleviate this issue without dropping offensive pressure, while Kingambit itself can make a strong partner for its ability to come in on Gholdengo along with other Ghost- and Poison-type moves from foes like Dragapult and Galarian Slowking, the latter of which being one of Hatterene's most prevalent checks with its high Special Defense and resistance to Draining Kiss. In return for Kingambit's positive matchups against these targets, Hatterene resists Fighting-type attacks from Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Iron Valiant that would typically be directed towards Kingambit. One Pokemon that Hatterene struggles to break through is Heatran, as it takes negligible damage from even a boosted Draining Kiss and can negate Hatterene's Leftovers recovery with Magma Storm's passive damage; If Hatterene has Tera available and has already boosted with multiple Calm Minds as Heatran enters the field, the matchup swings in Hatterene's favour, but Hatterene is notably unable to come in directly on Heatran to prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock. Offensive partners like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta can be used as switch-ins to Magma Storm, able to threaten the opposing Heatran out and with the latter appreciating Hatterene's ability to bait Heatran in and pop a potential Air Balloon. Although Hatterene is usually sufficient in keeping hazards off of its side of the field, on top of the aforementioned Stealth Rock Heatran matchup, opposing Hisuian Samurott are able to put hazards up with Ceaseless Edge despite losing to Hatterene itself. This makes alternative forms of hazard removal such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads good partners to Hatterene, as they can provide key relief in these matchups for hazard-weak teams that would otherwise be overly reliant on Hatterene. Through a coveted combination of Healing Wish, an elite ability in Magic Bounce, reasonably strong STAB moves, a typing that naturally checks Fighting-types, and a choice of Nuzzle to effortlessly spread paralysis or Mystical Fire to check special attackers and punish Steel-types, Hatterene can support its teammates in a way that cannot be fully replicated by anything else. Healing Wish is crucial, as it allows Hatterene to sacrifice itself in order to fully heal a teammate's HP and cure any status effects; because Hatterene is often paired with sweepers and Terrain or weather setters that enable them, this is often a perfectly acceptable trade to pivot them in safely. Psychic and Dazzling Gleam boast decent coverage together and greatly threaten Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Zamazenta thanks to Hatterene's high base Special Attack; Psychic leaves its mark against Poison-types like Glimmora and Toxapex, while Dazzling Gleam hits Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult and Dark-types like Darkrai. Nuzzle ensures that Hatterene remains far from passive by paralyzing anything bar Ground-types and Electric-types; even Gholdengo and opposing Hatterene, which are safe from paralysis from Thunder Wave, are crippled if hit by Nuzzle. Mystical Fire, however, complements Hatterene's STAB moves well by hitting Steel-types super effectively; it also always lowers the opponent's Special Attack, giving it some added utility against threats that can boost their Special Attack like Calm Mind Raging Bolt. Eject Button complements Magic Bounce perfectly; Hatterene's mere presence on a team will deter opponents from setting entry hazards and using status moves, and with significant investment, Hatterene's bulk is sufficient enough to switch directly into a strong neutral hit, survive, and activate Eject Button to safely pivot a teammate in. Eject Button also has the added benefit of turning the tables on U-turn and Volt Switch users, getting a free switch while denying their own switch. 132 Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outpace Ting-Lu, ensuring that it can at least get some chip damage against it before being attacked in return and expanding the number of slower threats it can use Healing Wish against before being KOed. The rest of its EVs serve to maximize its physical bulk, allowing Hatterene to better pivot in against most physical attackers such as unboosted Kingambit and Roaring Moon, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel allows Hatterene to handle Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant and Enamorus more easily so it can punish them with Nuzzle and turns Hatterene's Poison weakness into an immunity, allowing it to spinblock against Mortal Spin Glimmora. Steel's powerful defensive profile also expands the number of threats Hatterene can safely use Healing Wish against in a pinch, such as Iron Head Kingambit and Galarian Slowking; though very situational, other Tera types like Dark and Flying can accomplish similar goals against different threats like Gholdengo and Dragapult for the former and Great Tusk and Heavy Slam Zamazenta for the latter. Healing Wish Hatterene's ability to enable multiple free switches for its teammates makes it a strong choice for offensive teams—particularly teams vulnerable to entry hazards—that need to maximize a limited number of turns. Healing Wish Hatterene is almost mandatory on sun teams, which are often so vulnerable to hazards that its Magic Bounce serves as a strong secondary or even tertiary countermeasure against them; Fire-types such as Torkoal and Ninetales are especially weak to entry hazards, but even powerful attackers like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Choice Specs Walking Wake, Black Glasses and Air Balloon Kingambit, and Life Orb Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant can be worn down very quickly with hazard chip. Many of these are also answers to traditional Hatterene checks; powerful offensive threats like Choice Specs Walking Wake, Choice Band Roaring Moon, and offensive Great Tusk can collectively overwhelm Hatterene checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, which gives Hatterene plenty of opportunities to switch in on a neutral attack and either pivot out with Eject Button or use Healing Wish. Sun teams also greatly appreciate Hatterene's ability to give Torkoal an extra chance to support its team with Drought through Healing Wish, further enable these aforementioned offensive threats with Healing Wish, or spread paralysis with Nuzzle. Hatterene is also useful on rain teams for similar reasons; Pelipper greatly appreciates extra opportunities to set Drizzle up through Eject Button or Healing Wish, and teammates like Barraskewda and Raging Bolt appreciate both Hatterene's ability to deny hazards to keep them healthy and the many safe switches it can enable. Hatterene is also a staple on Psychic Terrain teams, which appreciate its ability to give Indeedee an extra chance to set up Psychic Terrain or to safely pivot in sweepers like Shell Smash Polteageist, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, offensive Deoxys-S, and Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Crown while wasting as few precious Psychic Terrain turns as possible."

  "Hawlucha": {
    "name": "Hawlucha",
    "text": "Hawlucha acts as a threatening sweeper and late-game cleaner on Terrain teams. Thanks to Grassy Seed activating Unburden, Hawlucha becomes faster than the majority of the metagame, outpacing Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users like Darkrai and Iron Valiant and providing plenty of coverage with its Fighting / Flying STAB combination. Its serviceable bulk, along with a boost to its Defense due to Grassy Seed, allows Hawlucha to use Swords Dance in front of many common foes, such as Kingambit and Great Tusk. Encore can force switches and thwart recovery attempts by locking the foe into a resisted attack or a recovery move. Alternatively, Substitute can also give Hawlucha the breathing room it might need to set up against incoming status moves from Gliscor and deny Sucker Punch and Thunderclap from Kingambit and Raging Bolt, respectively. Psychic Seed is an alternative to enable Hawlucha on Psychic Terrain teams, granting it a valuable Special Defense boost that can help it set up in the face of special attackers like Iron Valiant. 124 EVs in Speed are enough to outspeed Sand Rush Excadrill after Unburden activates, and the bulk investment allows it to survive a Make It Rain from Gholdengo from full HP. Either Tera Flying or Tera Fighting are great ways to enhance its damage output; after a Swords Dance, Hawlucha can OHKO Zamazenta through Dauntless Shield with Tera Flying and equally steamroll through Raging Bolt in one hit with Tera Fighting. Tera Flying also rids Hawlucha of its Fairy weakness, allowing it to avoid the 2HKO from Clefable's Moonblast. Alternatively, Tera Electric can be used to withstand Raging Bolt and Gholdengo, disallowing paralysis attempts and resisting Thunderclap and Make It Rain, respectively. Whenever Hawlucha opts to run Grassy Seed, Rillaboom is always nearby. Rillaboom's terrain-setting ability and slow U-turn is pivotal in unleashing Hawlucha's onslaught. It can additionally spread Knock Off to rid Skarmory and Corviknight of their Rocky Helmet, for instance. Strong partners on Grassy Terrain teams include Pokemon such as Iron Moth and Heatran that can help to pressure some of Hawlucha's checks prior to its sweep such as the aforementioned Skarmory and Corviknight. Entry hazard support in the form of Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, or Ting-Lu is also much appreciated. Hawlucha faces two big roadblocks in Gholdengo and Raging Bolt. Gholdengo in particular can easily shrug off Acrobatics and Close Combat, and it can take out Hawlucha while keeping itself healthy with Recover. Kingambit or the aforementioned Heatran have positive matchups against Gholdengo, while Pokemon like Hatterene can force Gholdengo in and weaken it while also providing a faster-paced Terrain team with entry hazard control. Raging Bolt, on the other hand, threatens non-Tera Electric Hawlucha with Thunderbolt and Thunderclap. It is therefore important to pair it with partners that can neutralize Raging Bolt such as Iron Valiant and Primarina. Indeedee is used instead of Rillaboom on Psychic Terrain teams. However, this is an inconsistent strategy in a metagame populated by Rillaboom, Roaring Moon, Hisuian Samurott and stall with some matches already lost at team preview, so Rillaboom is generally preferred. Rain teams can also handle Hawlucha, as Barraskewda still outspeeds it in the rain. Raging Bolt is a great check to rain teams that synergizes well with Grassy Terrain and can deal with rain's threats prior to Hawlucha cleaning up late-game."

  "Hemogoblin": {
    "name": "Hemogoblin",
    "text": "Hemogoblin is an amazing late-game sweeper thanks to its combination of strong priority and a great offensive typing. Pixilate-boosted Extreme Speed allows Hemogoblin to easily KO weakened targets and pressure offensive threats. Its strength also lets Hemogoblin sweep through teams with frail offensive cores such as Dragapult and Iron Valiant with particular ease if it finds a setup opportunity. Flare Blitz dents threats that resist Extreme Speed, such as Equilibra and Gholdengo. Bulk Up raises Hemogoblin’s middling Attack, allowing it to always OHKO defensive Equilibra with Flare Blitz at +1 and offensive Great Tusk with Extreme Speed at +2. Bulk Up also makes it harder to revenge kill Hemogoblin, turning offensive Great Tusk’s Headlong Rush and Booster Energy Roaring Moon’s Earthquake into a 2HKO at +1. Taunt stops slower foes such as Venomicon, Arghonaut, and Clefable from recovering their HP, allowing Hemogoblin to slowly wear down its checks throughout the game. Spikes is an option to capitalize on forced switches. Tera Fairy maximizes Extreme Speed’s wallbreaking power, while Tera Poison allows Hemogoblin to beat Cresceidon and turn defensive Venomicon into setup fodder. Tera Ground with Tera Blast allows Hemogoblin to break past threats such as Heatran, Mollux, and Plasmanta, as well as allowing it to win the mirror matchup against opposing Hemogoblin. The EV spread allows Hemogoblin to maximize Attack while outspeeding Adamant Kingambit. Alternatively, Hemogoblin can run 76 Speed EVs to outspeed Venomicon while gaining bulk Both Hex and Choice Specs Dragapult provide great synergy with Hemogoblin. Dragapult provides great speed control and can beat Great Tusk and Iron Moth, which Hemogoblin can struggle against. Dragapult’s Will-O-Wisp can wear down Hemogoblin’s checks such as Cresceidon, Venomicon, and Great Tusk over time, allowing it to KO them with Extreme Speed. Ground-immune teammates such as Equilibra and Gliscor greatly assist Hemogoblin by checking threats such as Great Tusk and opposing Gliscor. Ogerpon-W threatens Gliscor and Skeledirge for Hemogoblin while easily switching into Water-types such as Krilowatt. Together they can navigate around Venomicon and overwhelm it. With Taunt from Hemogoblin and Encore from Ogerpon-W, Venomicon quickly gets chipped and cannot easily recover HP without giving Hemogoblin setup opportunities. Plasmanta is also a great teammate, although more niche; it easily breaks through walls such as Venomicon, Cresceidon, Dondozo, and Skeledirge that Hemogoblin would otherwise struggle against. Plasmanta is also a great check to Ogerpon-W, which greatly threatens Hemogoblin. Entry hazards and duel screens leads such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S found on hyper offense greatly benefit Hemogoblin, giving it easier sweeping and setup opportunities. Explosion allows Hemogoblin to deal one last attack that will significantly dent even Fairy-resistant foes such as Venomicon and Skeledirge. At +2, it will even OHKO Multiscale Cresceidon. Explosion also gives a free switch-in to a teammate, grabbing huge amounts of momentum quickly. However, Explosion is unreliable, as it takes away valuable utility and can be hard to use with Hemogoblin’s low Speed. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to cripple threats like Great Tusk, Venomicon, and Kingambit but is mostly useless against checks such as Gliscor and Krilowatt. Choice Band gives Hemogoblin immediate power, allowing it to sweep with Extreme Speed more easily and break through Unaware Dondozo with Tera Fairy. However, this prevents Hemogoblin from using Bulk Up, leaves Hemogoblin vulnerable to all hazards, and is easily taken advantage of by Venomicon. Trick can be used in conjunction with Choice Band to cripple threats such as Venomicon and Equilibra with a hampering item. However, the lack of Choice Band or a setup move is noticeable, making Hemogoblin’s attacks rather weak. Tera Water allows Hemogoblin to more easily win mirror matchups against opposing Hemogoblin by resisting Flare Blitz, but otherwise is inferior to Tera Ground. Hemogoblin can also choose to run a specially defensive EV spread with a recovery move such as Moonlight or Wish and Tera Poison. This allows it to more easily set up on Venomicon while also making it more resilient into special wallbreakers such as Dragapult and Gholdengo. Wish also provides healing for teammates. However, doing so heavily reduces Hemogoblin's revenge killing potential due to a lack of Attack investment. Bulky Poison-types: Venomicon, Galarian Slowking, and Mollux can all tank Hemogoblin’s attacks and threaten it with Sludge Bomb. Pecharunt is more rare but does the same and threatens Toxic or Malignant Chain. All of them have to be wary of Hemogoblin Terastallizing, however. Fast Fairy-resistant Pokemon: Iron Moth, Plasmanta, Venomicon-E, and Heatran can tank a Pixilate-boosted Extreme Speed and threaten back with Poison-type STAB moves and Earth Power for the latter. Heatran has the added danger of trapping Hemogoblin with Magma Storm. Krilowatt: Krilowatt's great natural bulk lets it take a single Extreme Speed and force Hemogoblin out with the threat of a super effective Surf. Bulky Ground-types: Gliscor and Landorus-T can absorb an attack from Hemogoblin and immediately threaten it back with Earthquake, while Great Tusk can threaten it with Headlong Rush and tank a hit at the cost of a defensive Tera. Fairy-resistant Tera Users: Tera Poison and Tera Fire from threats such as Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Great Tusk can completely shut down a revenge kill attempt from Hemogoblin, with Tera Fire also heavily reducing Flare Blitz's damage, forcing Hemogoblin to either get KOed itself, or switch out. Unaware Users: Skeledirge and Dondozo are walls that are nearly impossible for Hemogoblin to break through. Skeledirge can slowly use Torch Song to chip its way through Hemogoblin’s HP, while Dondozo takes chunks of Hemogoblin’s health through Waterfall or Liquidation. Arghonaut can wall Hemogoblin too after burning Tera, freely setting Spikes if Hemogoblin lacks Taunt. Arghonaut can also force Hemogoblin out afterwards with Circle Throw."

  "Hippowdon": {
    "name": "Hippowdon",
    "text": "Hippowdon is one of the best physical walls in the tier, excelling thanks to its high base HP and Defense as well as the difficult to break pure Ground typing. Hippowdon has the best raw physical bulk compared to other physical walls such as Slowbro, Chesnaught, and Amoonguss. This bulk allows it to take neutral hits exceptionally well, making it a safe switch-in to unresisted moves like Terrakion’s Close Combat and Galarian Zapdos’s Brave Bird. As it is taking these hits, it is wearing foes down through passive damage from the sand it summons. It also has many chances to switch in, giving it plenty of opportunities to set up Stealth Rock. Hippowdon is the anchor for most balance teams in the tier, putting in work and making progress in basically every game. However, Hippowdon can struggle with particularly strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Mienshao or Galarian Zapdos because it does not resist their STAB attacks and struggles to take them effectively, and it is also vulnerable to passive damage such as entry hazards. The tier is full of threatening physical attackers, and Hippowdon handles most of them with ease, switching into attacks from Pokemon like Terrakion, Revavroom, Kleavor, Krookodile, Maushold, and Bisharp. Hippowdon's sand provides passive damage and helps disarm other weather teams by removing their weather. Stealth Rock is the most common option, as Hippowdon makes a good setter due to its many chances to switch in and good matchup against Cyclizar, the tier's best spinner. Whirlwind gives Hippowdon the option to force out setup sweepers or rack up chip damage against foes trying to switch into Earthquake. Whirlwind is preferred over Roar due to Throat Chop Bisharp blocking the latter move. Stone Edge is a coverage option to hit Flying-types trying to switch into the normally passive Hippowdon, allowing it to turn the tables on matchups like Salamence or Noivern. Stone Edge also helps to break Air Balloon on Pokemon such as Revavroom that try to turn Hippowdon into a setup opportunity. Rocky Helmet is the most common item due to its importance in dealing with Maushold, a Pokemon that can otherwise threaten to sweep teams on its own, while also providing chip damage against physical attackers. However, teams with other answers to Maushold or that don’t need the passive damage can instead run Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. Tera Ghost is an all-around strong defensive type that blocks Rapid Spin from Cyclizar, allows it to take on Terrakion even after a Swords Dance boost, and beats other Fighting types like Conkeldurr and Slither Wing. Tera Dragon removes Hippowdon's weaknesses to Grass and Water, being especially helpful against rain teams. Tera Poison gives Hippowdon a resistance to Grass, Fairy, and Fighting and makes Hippowdon immune to Toxic and able to absorb Toxic Spikes, being useful on teams that are otherwise weak to them. Hippowdon is common on bulky offense and balance teams. However, Hippowdon’s weaknesses must be accounted for in teambuilding, especially when considering the set it runs. Whirlwind Hippowdon needs to be paired with something that can handle Ground immune Pokemon like Noivern, Salamence, and Azelf well. Assault Vest Cyclizar and Umbreon are two Pokemon that can switch into them. While Hippowdon is able to switch into strong Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Terrakion and Mienshao when fully healthy, it loses this resilience with even just a little bit of chip damage. Therefore, Hippowdon should be paired with a more sturdy Fighting resistant Pokemon such as Slowbro or Reuniclus. Hippowdon without Whirlwind may require extra support for physical setup sweepers. Choice Scarf users faster than Salamence, such as Mienshao, Terrakion, Gengar, and Hisuian Zoroark, can all fill this role. Non-Stealth Rock Hippowdon should be paired with another Stealth Rock setter such as Empoleon or Jirachi. Certain teams such as ones with Pokemon running Synthesis or that have teammates that dislike passive sandstorm chip such as Alolan Muk and Suicune would prefer Sand Force, effectively giving it no ability. Sand Force also makes it easier to Terastallize Hippowdon, since it doesn’t have to worry about its own sandstorm and has a better matchup into other Hippowdon due to its stronger Earthquake. Hippowdon can also run varying amounts of Special Defense in order to better match up against special attackers — for example, 140 Special Defense EVs to survive two Photon Geysers from Necrozma — but Hippowdon often relies on maximum physical bulk to take neutral physical attacks. Ground-immune Pokemon: Mono-Earthquake Hippowdon is unable to hit Ground-immune foes at all, making Yanmega, Salamence, and Noivern incredibly safe switch-ins to it. Grass-types: Hippowdon with Stone Edge can hit Ground-immune foes but can't do any real damage to Grass-types such as Chesnaught. Special Attackers: Hippowdon's low Special Defense and reliance on Defense investment means it is vulnerable to special attacks even from uninvested attackers. Pokemon like Gengar and Gardevoir are attackers that Hippowdon does not want to switch in on, and bulky Pokemon with decent special damage such as Slowbro and Reuniclus are able to take Hippowdon's Earthquakes and threaten it in return. Wallbreakers with Entry Hazard Support: Pokemon like Choice Band Krookodile, Terrakion, and Mienshao can overcome Hippowdon's raw physical bulk with the help of chip damage such as hazard support. Mienshao can for instance get a guaranteed 2HKO on Hippowdon with Close Combat and one layer of Spikes."

  "Ho-Oh": {
    "name": "Ho-Oh",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Ho-Oh’s incredible stats, typing, and Regenerator make it one of the very best Pokemon in Ubers, being a great fit on many teams and performing well in nearly every battle. It is able to help its team stave off many threatening Pokemon like Koraidon, Extreme Killer Arceus, Necrozma-DM, and Calyrex-I. Even Pokemon like Miraidon and bulky Arceus formes that can take Ho-Oh’s STAB moves dislike getting burned by Sacred Fire. Unfortunately, Ho-Oh bears weaknesses to extremely dangerous Pokemon like Miraidon and Kyogre, making it not as hard to threaten as it might seem. Ironically, Ho-Oh’s greatest weakness is its high usage, as many Pokemon will run coverage specifically for it because of how common it is. For example, Zacian-C often runs Wild Charge, while Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground will often run Stone Edge. This, in conjunction with the fact that it needs to stay at high HP to check Scale Shot Koraidon, means it can get overwhelmed over the course of a game. Many physical attackers also run Tera Fire to gain an immunity to Sacred Fire burns and potentially use Ho-Oh as an opportunity to set up. Despite all of these, Ho-Oh is a fantastic Pokemon that every team must have a plan against and should be considered for any bulky team. Whirlwind is the preferred option for setup threats that run Tera Fire to set up on Ho-Oh, most notably Koraidon, Necrozma-DM, and Calyrex-I. Earthquake can be used to hit Miraidon, which otherwise can switch into Ho-Oh and proceed to force it out. Earthquake with Tera Ground also punishes use of Tera Fire on boosting threats to set up on Ho-Oh, although phazing a boosting threat with Whirlwind is often easier and more consistent. Tera Fairy is useful to block Scale Shot from Koraidon, which otherwise 2HKOes it without a boost. Tera Ground gives Ho-Oh STAB on Earthquake and turns its weaknesses to Electric- and Rock-type attacks into resistances. This allows it to turn the tables on Arceus-Ground and Flutter Mane, which commonly run Rock-type coverage to beat Ho-Oh. In conjunction with its high Special Defense, Tera Ground allows Ho-Oh to act as a soft check to Miraidon. Tera Grass gives Ho-Oh resistances to Electric and Water, allowing it to act as a soft check to Miraidon and Kyogre in a pinch. Ho-Oh fits on many bulky teams as an important part of their defensive core, but it cannot act as a team’s sole defensive check to threats like Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Extreme Killer Arceus, as these Pokemon can either overwhelm Ho-Oh with strong attacks or commonly run coverage specifically for it. Thus, more concrete checks to these Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy and Necrozma-DM are appreciated. Ho-Oh also does not match up well into Miraidon and Kyogre, so checks to them like Arceus-Ground, Ting-Lu, and Eternatus are essential. In return, Ho-Oh’s biggest boon to its team is Sacred Fire, allowing it to reliably spread burns and sometimes forcing Terastallization out of Pokemon like Necrozma-DM. Both of these attributes can be taken advantage of by Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Zacian-C, which enjoy their checks being burned or not being able to Terastallize to stop them. Earthquake pressures Miraidon, one of Ho-Oh's most common switch-ins, and gives it a way to hit Tera Fire users like Necrozma-DM, Koraidon, and Calyrex-I. Substitute is an option to take advantage of Gliscor and gives Ho-Oh a chance to freely throw out its powerful STAB attacks. Tera Ground synergizes with Earthquake and makes Ho-Oh a reliable check to Miraidon by guaranteeing that Earthquake KOs it with an Adamant nature. Tera Flying powers up Brave Bird, letting it 2HKO opposing defensive Ho-Oh. 152 Speed EVs with a neutral nature allow Ho-Oh to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured Necrozma-DM. The alternate EV spread with maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allows Ho-Oh to get the jump on defensive Arceus formes, giving it the ability to 2HKO them with Tera Flying Brave Bird. Koraidon is an excellent partner for pivoting in Ho-Oh and setting sun, while Ho-Oh pressures opposing Ho-Oh and Arceus-Fairy as well as helping Koraidon break through Gliscor and Kyogre. Since this Ho-Oh variant has far less bulk than a defensive one, it appreciates secondary Koraidon checks such as Kyogre and Arceus-Fairy, both of which can paralyze Eternatus, opposing Arceus formes, and Ho-Oh with Thunder Wave. Kyogre is also a solid partner for helping Ho-Oh check Calyrex-I, which this set cannot do well. Although it does not enjoy eating sun-boosted Sacred Fires, Miraidon can pivot into Ho-Oh and force it out. As such, partners such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Arceus-Ground pair well with Ho-Oh. In particular, Ting-Lu and Gliscor can set Spikes for Ho-Oh, letting it pressure Arceus-Water more easily. Arceus-Water and Kyogre are fantastic partners for taking advantage of Ho-Oh forcing Necrozma-DM, Arceus, and Calyrex-I to Terastallize into the Fire typing while helping Ho-Oh check Koraidon. Ho-Oh can also lure in Miraidon, Terastallize into the Ground typing, and defeat Miraidon for them. Flame Charge is an option on offensive Ho-Oh that prevents Zacian-C, Miraidon, and fast Arceus formes from revenge killing it, but this option is generally not preferred compared to the utility of Recover, Earthquake, and Substitute. Miraidon: Miraidon resists both of Ho-Oh's STAB moves and can use it as a chance to set up or throw out powerful STAB attacks. However, it has to watch out for Earthquake, and Heavy-Duty Boots variants are checked by Tera Grass and Tera Ground Ho-Oh. Water-types: Arceus-Water can pivot into Ho-Oh throughout the entire game, threaten it out with Judgment, and heal any damage from it. However, Arceus-Water must be wary of Sacred Fire burns in conjunction with entry hazards, limiting how easily it can enter the field against Ho-Oh. Kyogre can pivot into Sacred Fire and force Ho-Oh out, but it must be wary of Brave Bird. Dondozo is a niche Pokemon found on stall structures that is able to pivot into and outlast Ho-Oh with Rest and its natural bulk. All of the aforementioned Pokemon must be cautious of maximum Speed Jolly offensive Ho-Oh, which can outspeed and threaten to both 2HKO Arceus-Water and Kyogre and 3HKO Dondozo with Tera Flying Brave Bird. Knock Off Users: Ho-Oh must be wary of switching into Pokemon that have access to Knock Off, such as Necrozma-DM and Gliscor. However, if Stealth Rock is not on your side of the field or can be removed easily, then Ho-Oh can freely pivot into Knock Off users. Additionally, Ho-Oh can get past the issue of Stealth Rock by Terastallizing into another typing besides Flying. Eternatus: Eternatus can switch into any of Ho-Oh's attacks and threaten it with Toxic or Meteor Beam. Furthermore, its access to Recover lets it pivot in throughout the game. However, Earthquake chips Eternatus heavily, and offensive Ho-Oh can power through it with Brave Bird. Arceus-Ground: Arceus-Ground can pivot into Ho-Oh if it has physical bulk investment. Furthermore, its access to reliable recovery along with a strong Rock-type attack in Power Gem or Stone Edge means that Ho-Oh cannot freely enter in on it without scouting its coverage move. However, Sacred Fire burns and hazards can make it much more difficult for Arceus-Ground to pivot into Ho-Oh. Rock-type Coverage Moves: Ho-Oh must watch out for Rock-type coverage moves specifically aimed for it. This includes Power Gem from Flutter Mane as well as Rock Slide and Rock Tomb from both Groudon and Landorus-T. Eternatus, Lunala, and Necrozma-DW can slot Meteor Beam in order to surprise Ho-Oh as well. Tera Fire Pokemon: Pokemon that are pressured by Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire often opt for Tera Fire, such as Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-Ice, and Arceus. These Pokemon can use Ho-Oh as setup fodder after Terastallizing, and Arceus can use Taunt to prevent phazing. Giratina: Giratina’s massive physical bulk lets it pivot into any of Ho-Oh's attacks and use Defog or Rest freely."

  "Hoopa": {
    "name": "Hoopa",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Hoopa is an effective wallbreaker and cleaner thanks to its astronomically high Special Attack stat combined with its great STAB moves and solid movepool that lets it threaten common defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowbro, Scream Tail, Bronzong, and Wo-Chien. Psyshock is the generally superior Psychic-type move, letting it more easily break through common specially defensive Pokemon like Florges, Gastrodon, and Goodra. Alternatively, Psychic has more power, hitting the likes of Bellibolt, Mudsdale, and Gligar stronger than Psyshock. Focus Blast synergizes well with Hoopa's STAB moves, hitting Dark-types such as Scrafty, Bombirdier, and Wo-Chien that would otherwise hinder Hoopa's offensive progress. Trick is a useful utility move, hampering Pokemon such as Coalossal, Gastrodon, and Milotic that Hoopa would otherwise do lackluster damage to. Tera Fighting further powers up Focus Blast, letting it do things such as 2HKO Bellibolt and Grimmsnarl and potentially OHKO non-Assault Vest Duraludon and Wo-Chien. It also presents amazing defensive benefits, giving Hoopa a resistance to Sucker Punch from Skuntank and Zoroark and a neutrality to Decidueye's Shadow Sneak. Alternatively, Tera Ghost further powers up Shadow Ball, letting Hoopa 2HKO Gligar and Altaria and OHKO Kilowattrel while improving Hoopa's ability to clean late-game. Choice Scarf Hoopa fits best on offensive teams as both a form of speed control and a fast wallbreaker and capable of overwhelming both offensive and defensive foes alike. Hoopa's STAB moves are resisted by Dark-types, which leaves it vulnerable to being taken advantage of by Pokemon like Scrafty, Skuntank, and Zoroark, relying on the inaccurate Focus Blast to hit them. As a result, Pokemon that can beat Dark-types such as Florges, Paldean Tauros-W, Flamigo, and Heracross make for excellent partners, beating these threats while appreciating Hoopa's ability to break through the likes of Galarian Slowbro, Gligar, and Houndstone. Additionally, these Pokemon appreciate Hoopa's speed control, opening them up to performing other roles. They can also absorb Knock Off, which lets Hoopa both maintain its speed control and its longevity. Entry hazard setters such as Mudsdale, Bombirdier, and Duraludon heavily appreciate Hoopa's capability as a spinblocker while helping chip down foes such as Bellibolt and Rotom-H for Hoopa to 2HKO. The last two also check Decidueye, whose Shadow Sneak would otherwise force Hoopa out. Other wallbreakers such as Decidueye, Flamigo, Tatsugiri, and Zoroark can help wear down checks such as Skuntank, Meloetta, and Grimmsnarl while appreciating Hoopa's high Speed with Choice Scarf."

  "Houndstone": {
    "name": "Houndstone",
    "text": "Houndstone is a stellar physical wall courtesy of its immense bulk with Fluffy. Its vast array of disruptive utility moves and its great typing lets it check common physical attackers such as Paldean Tauros-W, Flamigo, Staraptor, and Pawmot, as well as letting it act as an excellent spinblocker. Night Shade is Houndstone's most reliable form of making progress thanks to its fixed damage, wearing down physical setup Pokemon such as Bulk Up Paldean Tauros-W and Bulk Up Hariyama. Body Press capitalizes on Houndstone's gargantuan Defense, targeting Dark-types like Zoroark, Wo-Chien, and Scrafty as well as Steel-types like Copperajah and Duraludon. Additionally, it lets non-Will-O-Wisp variants touch Normal-types such as Staraptor and Ambipom. Houndstone's last two slots are quite versatile; Will-O-Wisp lets it cripple a large variety of physical attackers, namely Paldean Tauros-W, Flamigo, Ambipom, and Staraptor, while also punishing Ghost-types such as Golurk and Decidueye that attempt to capitalize off of Houndstone's passivity. Protect synergizes amazingly with Will-O-Wisp, wearing down foes while helping maintain longevity with Leftovers. It can also assist in scouting attacks from foes like Choice Scarf Florges and Paldean Tauros-F. Alternatively, the combination of Rest and Sleep Talk offers Houndstone a form of semi-reliable recovery, letting it capitalize on the presence of Pokemon that are unable to do very much damage to it, namely foes like Choice Scarf Flamigo and Ambipom, to heal to full health. However, the unreliable nature of Sleep Talk may leave Houndstone open to being taken advantage of by offensive Pokemon like Arcanine and Scrafty, giving them a prime opportunity to use it as setup bait. Pain Split is a niche alternative, acting as a less committal option for recovery compared to Rest, although it is more unreliable due to its reliance on foe's HP. Charm is another niche alternative option, heavily halting the momentum of physical setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Scrafty, Curse Arcanine, and Bulk Up Paldean Tauros-W. Roar similarly dissuades setup Pokemon while having more utility against special attackers and synergizing well with entry hazards. Houndstone has a solid array of viable Tera types; Tera Water turns its Fire weakness into a neutrality, which can prove vital against the likes of Arcanine and Paldean Tauros-F. Tera Fighting powers up Houndstone's Body Press, letting it 2HKO Skuntank after Stealth Rock while alleviating its weakness to Dark so it can more easily handle the likes of Skuntank and Scrafty. Tera Fairy also gives Houndstone a Dark resistance as well as a Fighting resistance, opening it up to completely wall the likes of Hariyama and Bombirdier. Defensive Houndstone fits best on a variety of balance and bulky offense teams as a reliable physically defensive wall. Entry hazard setters such as Bronzong, Gligar, and Gastrodon make for excellent partners, heavily appreciating Houndstone's ability to block Rapid Spin attempts while in return offering their own great utility; Bronzong's Psychic Noise further bolsters burn damage from Houndstone's Will-O-Wisp. Gligar can use Toxic to stall out and wear down foes that Houndstone may not do as well against. Additionally, Earthquake and Knock Off can threaten Fire-types such as Arcanine, Emboar, and Paldean Tauros-F that Houndstone is weak to. Bulky setup Pokemon such as Curse Arcanine, Iron Defense Bronzong, and Calm Mind Florges appreciate Houndstone burning foes that could otherwise overwhelm them, making it easier for them to find opportunities to set up and sweep. Specially defensive Pokemon such as Florges, Gastrodon, and Wo-Chien can handle the special attackers that Houndstone may otherwise struggle with such as Kilowattrel, Inteleon, and Hoopa, respectively. Scream Tail is another great defensive partner that can provide Wish support, which can open Houndstone up to more easily run Will-O-Wisp and Protect. Pokemon that can check Dark-types such as Florges, Skuntank, and Paldean Tauros-W are good partners for Houndstone, being able to switch in on Dark-type moves from the likes of Scrafty, Zoroark, and Bombirdier. In return, Florges can provide valuable Wish support, Skuntank can use useful utility moves like Knock Off and Taunt to assist Houndstone in wearing down foes, and Paldean Tauros-W can capitalize off of Dark-types for offensive momentum. While it faces tight competition from Decidueye and Golurk, which are both stronger, Houndstone dual functions as an effective wallbreaker and spinblocker. Fluffy is a noteworthy niche over the aforementioned Ghost-types, preventing Houndstone from being immediately ruined by moves like Knock Off and letting it trade more easily with physical attackers like Pawmot and Flamigo. Houndstone also has access to Play Rough, which hits Staraptor and Dark-types like Scrafty and Bombirdier harder than Decidueye often can, in addition to Shadow Sneak, which Golurk notably lacks. Roar prevents setup sweepers like Paldean Tauros-W, Arcanine, Scream Tail, and Dudunsparce from exploiting Houndstone or getting out of hand and spreads chip damage if entry hazards are up. Pain Split can be used instead of Roar to improve Houndstone's longevity, which bulkier teams may find more useful. Will-O-Wisp is another option that wears down walls like Wo-Chien while still punishing threats like Skuntank and slowing setup sweepers like Paldean Tauros-W down. Both options are less consistent than Roar, though, due to being predictable and having imperfect accuracy, respectively. Body Press nails Normal-types like Tera Normal Scream Tail and offers accurate coverage for Dark-types, but it's not very useful otherwise. Spell Tag allows Poltergeist to 2HKO Florges and OHKO Galarian Slowbro after Stealth Rock and one layer of Spikes. It also turns Shadow Sneak a better revenge killing tool. Spell Tag is generally better than Choice Band, even with the added power and Houndstone's access to Trick, since it gives Houndstone more room for error against Dark-types. Either Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers can be used to give Houndstone more staying power, which may be desirable on bulkier teams, but it loses quite a bit of power without Spell Tag. Tera Fairy removes Houndstone's weaknesses to Dark and Ghost, allowing it to get past threats like Bombirdier and Decidueye. It also boosts Play Rough and blocks Tatsugiri's Draco Meteor, which gives Houndstone an easier time denying its Rapid Spin. Tera Ghost gives Spell Tag-boosted Poltergeist the strength to 2HKO physical walls like Bellibolt after Stealth Rock and makes up for the power Houndstone loses if it forgoes Spell Tag. Houndstone's great matchup against entry hazard removers like Alolan Sandslash and Scyther make it a good fit on hazard-stacking teams, though its wallbreaking potential and Fluffy-boosted bulk are valuable traits for bulky offense in general. Gastrodon is an amazing partner, blanking special Fire-types like Delphox and Salazzle and standing up to spinners that can pressure Houndstone out of switching in, such as Tatsugiri and Coalossal. Sturdier physical walls like Mudsdale and Gligar can cover Houndstone against threats like Arcanine, Bombirdier, and Paldean Tauros-F while still offering hazard support to help it push past bulky foes like Duraludon. Gligar should strongly consider not running Knock Off when pairing with Houndstone, though, since the move synergizes poorly with Poltergeist. Houndstone is virtually helpless against Normal-types like Dudunsparce and also struggles with Dark-types like Skuntank and Zoroark, which makes Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W and Flamigo excellent offensive teammates. In return, Houndstone offers these Pokemon some safety against revenge killers like Scyther and Ambipom, pressures physical walls like Bellibolt, and threatens Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro and Scream Tail. Sticky Web teams love the role compression that Houndstone provides and are more than capable of punishing the spinners that do threaten it, with the best setters being Vikavolt and Smeargle."

  "Hydrapple": {
    "name": "Hydrapple",
    "text": "Hydrapple serves as a solid balance breaker, using its bulk and offensive prowess to handle threats like Excadrill while also being scary for foes like Tornadus-T and Metagross once is has set up Nasty Plot. It also has Regenerator to heal off any damage taken while checking these threats, allowing it to potentially repeat this process later in the game. Fickle Beam is an alternative move over Draco Meteor so Hydrapple can avoid the Special Attack drop while having a chance to deal more damage than Draco Meteor, allowing it to maintain its Nasty Plot boosts and to remain a big threat after firing it off. However using Fickle Beam means Hydrapple can miss out on KOs against foes like Zapdos and Tornadus-T if the boost doesn't activate. Earth Power provides coverage for Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross so that they cannot easily come in to cause issues for Hydrapple. Heavy-Duty Boots serves to make Hydrapple's healing from Regenerator more effective while improving its longevity by removing its vulnerability to entry hazards, as it commonly has to utilize its great typing to switch into powerful wallbreakers like Excadrill and Ogerpon. Maximum HP and maximum Defense make Hydrapple incredibly difficult for physical attackers to break, letting it better soak up U-turn from Scizor, Lokix, and Zarude as well as powerful hits from wallbreakers like Hisuian Arcanine or Tyranitar so that it can more easily set up Nasty Plot. Tera Steel improves its matchup against Ogerpon-C while also giving it a Toxic immunity to help against Toxapex and Mandibuzz, a Flying resistandce so it can set up Nasty Plot in front of Tornadus-T, and a Fairy resistance useful for dodging an OHKO from Choice Band Azumarill's Play Rough in case of emergency. Tera Fairy lets it set up more easily on Latios and opposing Hydrapple without gaining weaknesses to Excadrill and Mamoswine. However, Terastalizing Hydrapple removes its beneficial resistances to Ground and Electric, making it tougher to handle Volt Switch users such as Sandy Shocks and Rotom-W. Hydrapple acts as a solid wallbreaker for balance and bulky offensive playstyles, using its defensive profile to switch into foes that are offensively threatening or tough to break and then becoming a threat of its own. Slowking is a nice partner for it, forming a double Regenerator core that helps work around some problems for Hydrapple such as Tornadus-T and Tinkaton while acting a secondary Water resist in the event Hydrapple needs to Tera. Slowking also slow pivots to Hydrapple with Chilly Reception after soaking up a hit, allowing Hydrapple to either be a bigger threat due to having more HP or get its HP back from Regenerator more easiliy. Additionally, Slowking can use Thunder Wave against foes like Tinkaton and Mandibuzz to make them slower than Hydrapple, allowing it to more easily set up Nasty Plot. Zapdos is also a good teammate, defensively answering Scizor and Lokix, which can pose problems with their strong U-turn should they switch in on Hydrapple when it’s chipped. Hydrapple appreciates teammates that can help wear down Tinkaton into Earth Power range such as Lokix and Tornadus-T. It also appreciates Pokemon that can help pressure or defensively answer Flying-types such as Tyranitar or Rhyperior. Hydrapple apprecieates Stealth Rock setters like Cobalion and the previously mentioned Rhyperior to get targets into range of its boosted attacks more easily. Sand teams appreciate Hydrapple's defensive profile in tandem with Regenerator, it can use an Eject Button to safely bring in Excadrill and act as check to opposing Excadrill and Keldeo, which can be scary for sand teams otherwise. Choice Specs Hydrapple is a dangerous wallbreaker that provides a lot of defensive utility through its typing to answer threats like Excadrill, Sandy Shocks, and Ogerpon. Leaf Storm and Draco Meteor are powerful and spammable STAB moves despite the Special Attack drop drawback. Earth Power provides coverage against Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross. Hydrapple lacks coverage outside of Earth Power, so Fickle Beam is usually preferred to have a secondary Dragon-type STAB move that doesn't have the ramification of lowering its Special Attack. Similarly, Giga Drain is another option to provide a secondary Grass-type STAB move that doesn't force Hydrapple to switch out and provides it with more longevity. Regenerator helps Hydrapple answer Excadrill and the Ogerpon formes and provides ample opportunities for Hydrapple to get into a position to wallbreak by keeping it healthy across a match. The EV spread allows Hydrapple to outspeed Azumarill and Ursaluna while maximizing its damage output. Tera Steel should primarily be used for its defensive value to flip the matchup against threats like Latios, Azumarill, and Scizor. Tera Fairy allows Hydrapple to combat Latios and opposing Hydrapple. However, Hydrapple should only Terastallize when necessary, as giving up its great defensive typing greatly hinders its matchup against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Excadrill. Hydrapple fits best on offensive teams that can help it get in safely and take pressure off it being the sole answer to the likes of Excadrill and Ogerpon. Pivots such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos are fantastic partners for these reasons; the former forms a Regenerator core, while the latter can punish Pokemon like Scizor and Azumarill with Static, crippling them for Hydrapple to outspeed. Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross prevent Hydrapple from easily locking into its STAB moves, so Pokemon like Excadrill, Slowking, and Sandy Shocks can help check and apply pressure on them. Excadrill notably provides Rapid Spin support to prevent Hydrapple being worn down by entry hazards and can act as a check to Latios, allowing Hydrapple to preserve the option to Terastallize. Sandy Shocks can provide Spikes support to wear down Pokemon like specially defensive Tyranitar and Toxapex into OHKO range while also checking Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Assault Vest Tornadus-T is a fairly consistent pivot into Hydrapple, so it is essential to have means to overwhelm it. Tyranitar, Tinkaton, and Rhyperior can provide Stealth Rock support to restrict Tornadus-T's ability to pivot into Hydrapple while being great defensive checks to Tornadus-T. Tinkaton can also provide Knock Off support to help remove key items like Tornadus-T's Assault Vest. Other Knock Off users like Scizor and Lokix can also achieve this while also getting Hydrapple in against Pokemon they struggle to get through like Toxapex and Cobalion."

  "Incineroar": {
    "name": "Incineroar",
    "text": "The combination of Knock Off, good typing, and Intimidate makes Incineroar a great wallbreaker while being a solid defensive Pokemon. Sword Dance sets can make Incineroar into a great wallbreaker, since many defensive staples like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Registeel just drop to its Swords Dance-boosted STAB attacks. Also, Incineroar easily checks the common Ghost-, Grass-, and Steel-types like Chandelure, Brambleghast, and Klefki, meaning it can take advantage of its utility moves it can go for a more defensively-oriented pivot set if it wishes. It has Will-O-Wisp and Knock Off to cripple incoming physical wallbreakers like Toxicroak, Flygon, and Mienshao and item-reliant Pokemon like Talonflame, Avalugg, and Swampert, respectively. Defensive Incineroar is solid for handling special wallbreakers such as Hisuian Typhlosion, Porygon-Z, and Heavy-Duty Boots Munkidori. However, Incineroar's low Speed stat makes it very easy for wallbreakers with a middling Speed tier like Basculegion, Breloom, and Heracross to outspeed and destroy it with their own STAB attacks. Incineroar's reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots can be felt, since it has to be wary of switching into opposing Knock Off from Tsareena, Alolan Muk, and Wo-Chien. It even has to worry about switching into the Pokemon it checks best, Chandelure, as it carries Trick to cripple Incineroar. Incineroar also lacks any form of recovery, making it easily worn down over the course of a battle. U-turn allows Incineroar to pivot on, chip away at, and not get taken advantage of by its checks like Swampert and Diancie. Earthquake, on the other hand, provides a powerful attack that has no drawback that also hits the common Rock-, Poison-, and Fire-types like Iron Thorns, Dragalge, and opposing Incineroar. An Adamant nature can be used to allow Incineroar to 2HKO Pokemon like Alolan Muk and Talonflame, but a Jolly nature is useful for outspeeding foes like Modest Choice Specs Sylveon and unboosted Torterra. A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 212 SpD / 48 Spe with a Careful nature can alternatively be used on Swords Dance sets, allowing Incineroar to safely handle Cresselia while letting it better pivot into foes like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Meloetta; the Speed EVs let Incineroar outpace foes like Brute Bonnet and Alolan Muk. Tera Poison gives Incineroar an immunity to poison from Alolan Muk and Vileplume while having a resistance to Fighting-type attacks. However, Tera Fairy provides a more well-rounded defensive typing that isn't weak to Ground-type attacks while still resisting Fighting-type attacks, giving opportunities for Incineroar to set up against Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Breloom. Tera Ghost, on the other hand, allows Incineroar to completely blank Close Combat, and it helps to revenge kill Cinccino. This comes at a trade-off of it having no other useful resistances, though. Incineroar can partner with other pivots like Rotom-C, Flygon, and Swampert, which tend to draw in Grass-types like Brute Bonnet, Vileplume, and Tsareena for Incineroar to prey on and form a VoltTurn core able to chip away at each other's checks. Entry hazard removers like Brambleghast, Tsareena, and Tentacruel can be great partners, since they can remove entry hazards if Incineroar loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. Incineroar can struggle against bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Quagsire, and Swampert that can tank its STAB attacks, so it pairs with Pokemon like Toxicroak, Rotom-C, and Vileplume, as they can check the aforementioned Water-types. Fairy- and Poison-types like Sylveon, Dragalge, and Vileplume appreciate Incineroar for checking Steel-types like Registeel, Klefki, and Bronzong; in return, they can check Fighting-types like Mienshao, Infernape, and Gallade. Will-O-Wisp allows Incineroar to cripple its common switch-ins like Diancie, Swampert, and Gallade. Parting Shot can be used to weaken foes, pivot, and provide safety for setup sweepers. However, U-turn can be used because it allows Incineroar to pivot out from Diancie and Registeel that would usually be immune to Parting Shot due to their Clear Body ability. The given EV spread allows Incineroar to get the jump on Brute Bonnet while having as much special bulk as possible. Tera Fairy provides it the ability to check Dragon- and Fighting-types like Flygon, Mienshao, and Gallade while also letting it resist the omnipresent U-turn. Alternatively, Tera Dragon gives Incineroar the ability to check a myriad of special attackers like Toxtricity, Vileplume, and Inteleon. Tera Water is similar to Tera Dragon but replaces a Grass resistance for an Ice resistance, making Incineroar better against Inteleon. Grass-types like Tsareena, Brambleghast, and Vileplume are great partners for Incineroar, since they can handle bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Vaporeon, Swampert, and Gastrodon. Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Infernape can force Incineroar to switch, so it best pairs with physically defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro, Bellibolt, and Sylveon that can handle the aforementioned Fighting-types. Additionally, Sylveon can provide Incineroar with recovery by passing it a Wish. Wallbreakers like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Toxtricity appreciate Incineroar's slow Parting Shot, as they can get a free entry on Rock-, Fighting-, and Water-types that tend to switch in on Incineroar. Setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia, Swords Dance Toxicroak, and Dragon Dance Flygon similarly appreciate Incineroar's Parting Shot weakening foes and it giving them more opportunities to set up. Incineroar's longevity is limited and can be cut severely if it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots, so it pairs well with entry hazard removers such as Tsareena, Tentacruel, and Brambleghast. Close Combat is an option to hit many foes neutrally like Swampert and Diancie while also hitting foes like Iron Thorns and opposing Incineroar super effectively. Flame Charge gives Incineroar the opportunity to become a late-game cleaner after picking off a weakened threat. Alternatively, Trailblaze can be used alongside Tera Grass to hit Water-types super effectively but it's pretty reliant on Terastallization to do good damage. Iron Head can be used on Swords Dance Incineroar to surprise Sylveon, Diancie, and Florges, but the ability to pivot, boost its Speed, or use a high-Base Power coverage move tends to be better overall. Weakness Policy + Power Trip sets can be used on hyper offense teams, letting Incineroar become a dangerous sweeper. Incineroar has a bunch of usable defensive Tera types, but they are really inconsistent for many teams. Tera Flying helps Incineroar take on Fighting- and Ground-type attacks, but it retains its weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Grass gives Incineroar a resistance to Water- and Ground-type attacks but gives it a bad matchup against opposing Fire-types like Chandelure, Infernape, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Water-types: Vaporeon, Milotic, and Swampert can switch into its Flare Blitz and threaten Incineroar back with their own STAB attacks, but they have to be wary about switching into a boosted Knock Off from Swords Dance sets. Offensive Water-types like Inteleon and Basculegion, while they have to be worried about switching into its Knock Off, can easily destroy it. Quagsire is notable for shutting down Incineroar sweeps due to Unaware and punish it back by spreading Toxic or hitting Incineroar with its STAB Earthquake. Ground-types: Flygon, Swampert, and Quagsire destroy Incineroar with their STAB Earthquake, but they have to be wary about switching into Will-O-Wisp from bulkier sets. Fighting-types: Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Breloom outspeed Incineroar and destroy it with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. Infernape and Paldean Tauros-W resist both of Incineroar's STAB attacks and use it as setup fodder. Rock-types: Diancie and Iron Thorns can tank Incineroar's STAB attacks very well and use it to set up Stealth Rock or hit it back with their STAB Rock-type attacks. Item Displacement: Common Knock Off users like Tsareena, Alolan Muk, and Wo-Chien can threaten Incineroar by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it a lot weaker to entry hazards. On top of this, Pokemon it would love to switch into like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z often carry Trick to cripple it."

  "Inteleon": {
    "name": "Inteleon",
    "text": "Inteleon's Speed tier and sky-high Special Attack make it a formidable threat in NU. Not only is it blazing fast, but with Choice Specs, it's also quite powerful and can 2HKO many common special walls like Alolan Muk, Copperajah, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro on the switch with Hydro Pump. Even when facing Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon, Toxicroak, and Vaporeon, Inteleon still has a way to flip the matchup in its favor in its U-turn, which lets it bring in teammates like Breloom, Flygon, and Toxicroak to take advantage of these checks. On the other hand, Inteleon does face a bit of competition from Basculegion and Paldean Tauros-W, as the former can switch up its moves because it largely uses Mystic Water, the latter has Intimidate, and both have access to priority and easily fit coverage for Toxicroak; however, it isn't hindered by contact punishment such as Talonflame's Flame Body and Vileplume's Rocky Helmet and Effect Spore. It also has to deal with not being able to use its strongest move when up against teams with Water-immune Pokemon, which greatly halts Inteleon's progress-making, as it's almost always forced to use U-turn against them if it doesn't want to give up momentum. Hydro Pump is the preferred STAB option due to its power, but it can be unreliable at times. Alternatively, Surf can be run for accuracy in exchange for power. Ice Beam complements Inteleon's Water-type STAB move really well by hitting Grass- and Dragon-types like Decidueye, Vileplume, and Goodra super effectively. Dark Pulse provides Inteleon with a coverage move so that it isn't completely useless against Water-types like Vaporeon and Basculegion. U-turn allows Inteleon to pivot on even Water-immune Pokemon like Gastrodon and Vaporeon. Instead of Ice Beam or Dark Pulse, Inteleon could opt for Air Slash to better target Toxicroak and Paldean Tauros-W, but its lower Base Power means that it's worse at breaking through other Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon. Tera Water boosts Inteleon's STAB move to insane levels, but Tera Ghost allows Inteleon to avoid priority like Breloom's Mach Punch and resist Flygon's First Impression while blanking high-Base Power attacks like Mienshao's and Infernape's Close Combat. Inteleon forces in bulky Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon like Gastrodon, Vaporeon, and Tsareena, and it can capitalize on this with U-turn, letting it bring in a threat that takes advantage of them like Brambleghast, Toxicroak, or Incineroar. Toxicroak is an especially noteworthy partner, as it walls the most common Inteleon switch-in in Vaporeon and can use it as either setup fodder or a chance to throw out high-Base Power attacks. In return, Inteleon handles Fire- and Ground-types for the former two and can easily overwhelm physical walls Flygon brings in. Inteleon is quite powerful, but to achieve any of its 2HKOs, especially those against Water-type checks like Milotic and Vaporeon, it requires entry hazards to chip away at its foes; Copperajah, Bronzong, Gligar, and Klefki all synergize well to fill this role. Even without entry hazards, however, most special walls that do not resist Inteleon's STAB attacks like Bronzong, Alolan Muk, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro have a hard time switching in, as Bronzong is 2HKOed right away and Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro are 2HKOed after minimal chip damage. Special attacking partners like Diancie, Munkidori, and Nasty Plot Toxicroak make for good teammates, as they greatly appreciate Inteleon's ability to overwhelm their checks. Inteleon is threatened by Grass- and Electric-types like Tsareena, Rotom-C, and Kilowattrel, so Grass-types and Flying-resistant Pokemon like Vileplume, Wind Rider Brambleghast, and Diancie make for strong switch-ins to these threats. With Inteleon's frailty, it prefers to have slow pivots like Tsareena, Dragalge, and Incineroar, as they can draw out Fire- and Ground-types for Inteleon to threaten. Inteleon can also run a Scope Lens + Sniper set that is similar to its Choice Specs moveset except with Hydro Pump being traded out for Snipe Shot. When landing a critical hit, Inteleon can dent many Pokemon, but its unreliability makes it weaker overall. Choice Scarf Inteleon reaches a blisteringly fast Speed tier and, with its high Special Attack and U-turn, easily revenge kills many setup sweepers and can create momentum. A moveset of Hydro Pump / Ice Beam / U-turn / Taunt can be run alongside Heavy-Duty Boots to bother passive Pokemon that would easily take advantage of Inteleon otherwise like Alolan Muk, Vaporeon, and Bronzong. Inteleon can drop U-turn in favor of running a second STAB move, like Surf or Snipe Shot, alongside Hydro Pump, letting it choose the right move depending on its situation; however, losing momentum versus Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon can be annoying at times. Tera Blast Grass can be run to snipe Water-immune Pokemon like Vaporeon and Gastrodon, but because Inteleon has to Terastallize to make use of it and already has access to U-turn, it typically is unnecessary and thus isn't used. Tera Dark can be used to boost Dark Pulse, letting Inteleon have a chance against checks like Vaporeon and Milotic, especially after they've been chipped. Water-immune Pokemon: All of Vaporeon, Gastrodon, and Toxicroak blank Inteleon's STAB attack, and the former two can take the rest of Inteleon's attacks decently well, though the latter drops to Ice Beam. However, with access to U-turn and strong coverage moves, Inteleon can find ways around these matchups. Water- and Dragon-types: Basculegion and Milotic can switch into Inteleon's Hydro Pump and Ice Beam and proceed to use it for momentum, but neither of them enjoy switching in on a Dark Pulse. Similarly, Dragalge can take Inteleon's Hydro Pump decently but dislikes having to take an Ice Beam. Grass-types: Brambleghast, Tsareena, and Breloom can take Inteleon's Hydro Pump and proceed to KO it with their Grass-type STAB moves, but they can't do this repeatedly. Similarly, bulkier Grass-types like Brute Bonnet and Vileplume can switch into Hydro Pump and threaten with Seed Bomb or Giga Drain, respectively; however, the former's lack of recovery and the latter's poor Special Defense leads them to being overwhelmed. On top of this, all of these Grass-types must fear Ice Beam. Revenge Killers: Due to Inteleon's frailty, faster Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Munkidori easily threaten Inteleon with a KO and can use it for momentum, but they fail to switch in reliably with their lack of bulk."

  "Iron Boulder": {
    "name": "Iron Boulder",
    "text": "Swords Dance Iron Boulder is a setup sweeper as well as one of the most effective forms of speed control in the current metagame, outspeeding the likes of Booster Energy Iron Valiant and +1 Roaring Moon. Close Combat hits targets such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Earthquake can be used over Close Combat, forgoing the Ting-Lu matchup for a better matchup into non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. These moves can be run in conjunction with each other, but in that case Iron Boulder has difficult matchups against Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Zen Headbutt can be used to improve these matchups as well as provide a reliable means of revenge killing Booster Energy Iron Valiant, again in exchange for the Gholdengo matchup. Substitute is also a viable option, and it can be used to ease Iron Boulder's matchup versus Sucker Punch from Kingambit, as well as allowing it to avoid Thunder Wave from Galarian Slowking as it sets up. Given a free turn to set it up, Substitute can also allow Iron Boulder to avoid being revenge killed by priority, such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. However, its main use case is with Tera, as Substitute + Tera Flying allows Iron Boulder to circumvent Gliscor—which otherwise would be a solid check—and turn it into setup fodder by avoiding both Toxic and Earthquake. Running Taunt over Substitute is also an option; aside from beating Gliscor one-on-one with Tera Flying, it also allows Iron Boulder to overwhelm Skarmory by preventing its Iron Defense and Roost attempts. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat, notably helping Iron Boulder brute force its way past Skarmory, while also allowing it to OHKO Ting-Lu after a Swords Dance. It also provides a Sucker Punch resistance, which helps versus Kingambit. Tera Ground can be used to boost the power of Earthquake, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulkier variants of Gholdengo at +2 as well as helping Iron Boulder avoid being picked off by Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Tera Flying not only lets Iron Boulder wall Gliscor in combination with Substitute but also grants it a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and facilitates setup opportunities versus other Ground-types like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Iron Boulder's power and its top-tier speed, alongside its good coverage and access to Swords Dance, make it very suitable for hyper offense teams. Teammates such as Kingambit appreciate the weakening of shared checks such as Landorus-T and Skarmory. The same goes for Iron Moth but with Ting-Lu and Gliscor. Iron Valiant also appreciates Gliscor being weakened and can whittle down shared checks such as Gholdengo to make it easier for Iron Boulder to sweep later. Iron Boulder struggles with entry hazard damage putting it in KO range of priority moves such as Kingambit’s Sucker Punch and Rillaboom’s Grassy Glide after Tera. Teammates that are effective at keeping hazards off your side such as Taunt Deoxys-S, Glimmora, Hatterene, or Great Tusk are good partners. The first two also provide their own hazards, facilitating the weakening of Iron Boulder's checks. Iron Boulder also has difficulty overcoming Dondozo. Partners that can weaken it or take advantage of it, such as Taunt Roaring Moon or Ogerpon-W, respectively, are good partners."

  "Iron Bundle": {
    "name": "Iron Bundle",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Iron Bundle is one of the foremost speed control options in Ubers thanks to its fantastic offensive typing and the fact that it is one of the few Pokemon surpassing the critical base 135 Speed tier. Hydro Pump and Freeze-Dry give Iron Bundle perfect coverage, and Ice Beam deals considerable damage to many prominent threats in the tier, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Eternatus, and Arceus-Ground. Unfortunately, Iron Bundle is hampered by its dreadful defensive typing and special bulk, which leaves most teams with abundant means of OHKOing it; for example, even uninvested attacks such as Judgment from the Arceus formes and Dynamax Cannon from defensive Eternatus can OHKO Iron Bundle. As a result, Iron Bundle has difficulty getting safely onto the battlefield without the help of pivoting moves from its teammates. Additionally, Iron Bundle must be wary of potential status moves from the likes of defensive Arceus formes, Kyogre, Giratina-O, Eternatus, and Gliscor, since paralysis renders Iron Bundle completely useless, while poison and burn exacerbate Iron Bundle's problems with longevity. Heavy-Duty Boots mitigates Iron Bundle's crippling weakness to entry hazards, allowing it to repeatedly come in and threaten the myriad of Pokemon it outspeeds and hits for super effective damage, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Arceus-Ground. Taunt prevents walls like defensive Arceus formes, Ting-Lu, and Necrozma-DM from using recovery or status moves. Additionally, Iron Bundle is one of the fastest Taunt users in the tier, letting it block entry hazards from dedicated leads or shut down setup sweepers in an emergency. Encore is an alternative option that performs better against foes attempting to use setup moves at the cost of being unable to prevent status moves and hazards. Tera Ghost gives Iron Bundle immunities to Extreme Speed and Fighting-type moves, which helps it significantly against Arceus, Rayquaza, and Choice Scarf Koraidon. Tera Ice boosts the power of Iron Bundle's Ice-type moves, allowing it to OHKO Koraidon and Miraidon with Ice Beam and 2HKO Kyogre with Freeze-Dry. Although Iron Bundle boasts a phenomenal Speed stat and offensive typing, it needs the help of its teammates to overcome its terrible defensive profile and lack of power. Miraidon is an ideal teammate, since it can wallbreak for Iron Bundle, bring it in safely with U-turn, and give it a Quark Drive boost by setting Electric Terrain, enabling Iron Bundle to outspeed even Choice Scarf Koraidon, Zacian-C, and Dragon Dance Arceus formes. Additionally, Iron Bundle threatens the Ground-types that frequently switch in against Miraidon. Kyogre can set rain to strengthen Iron Bundle's Hydro Pump, and together, they can overwhelm bulky Water-resistant Pokemon such as Arceus-Water and Eternatus. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ting-Lu, Gliscor, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Fairy wears down foes for Iron Bundle. Ting-Lu and Gliscor can also switch into any Electric-type attacks thrown at Iron Bundle. Zacian-C naturally outspeeds Iron Bundle and OHKOes it with most of its attacks; as such, a reliable answer like Necrozma-DM is needed as a teammate. Necrozma-DM also handles Extreme Speed Arceus for Iron Bundle and pressures bulky teams with Knock Off. Koraidon checks like Arceus-Fairy and Ho-Oh are helpful teammates, since Iron Bundle cannot beat Koraidon if it is at full health or has Tera available. Tera Water is an option to boost the power of Hydro Pump, enabling Iron Bundle to 2HKO common defensive Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Fairy as well as improving its matchup against Zacian-C. However, the defensive utility of Tera Ghost and the damage benchmarks achieved by Tera Ice are typically more valuable to the teams Iron Bundle finds itself on. Flip Turn can be used in the last moveslot to maintain momentum against the switches Iron Bundle often forces, but the utility of Taunt or Encore is one of the primary motives for using Iron Bundle and is almost never worth forgoing. A power boosting item like Choice Specs or Life Orb allows Iron Bundle to accomplish notable KOs without the need to Terastallize, such as OHKOs against Koraidon and Miraidon with Ice Beam and most Arceus-Ground with Hydro Pump and 2HKOs against Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Fairy, and Calyrex-I with Hydro Pump. Iron Bundle's atrocious longevity and complete dependence on prediction with these items makes them difficult to justify using, though. Zacian-C: Zacian-C not only resists Iron Bundle's Ice-type moves, but it also is one of the few Pokemon in Ubers that naturally outspeeds Iron Bundle, and with its Intrepid Sword boost, it can comfortably OHKO Iron Bundle with nearly all of its moves. Kyogre: Although Freeze-Dry deals super effective damage, a bulky Kyogre cannot be 2HKOed unless Iron Bundle Terastallizes Ice, and Kyogre can OHKO Iron Bundle with Thunder or even a resisted Origin Pulse or Water Spout. Choice Scarf Users: With a Choice Scarf, Pokemon that Iron Bundle usually outspeeds like Koraidon, Eternatus, and Kyogre can gain the Speed advantage and OHKO it as long as Electric Terrain is not active. Koraidon is especially bothersome, as its sun hinders Iron Bundle's damage output with Hydro Pump. It should be noted, however, that Koraidon and Eternatus cannot safely switch into Ice Beam. Priority Moves: Iron Bundle's poor bulk makes it vulnerable to being picked off by priority moves like Extreme Speed and Sucker Punch. Encore can shut down most priority users, but this requires Iron Bundle to Terastallize or correctly predict the use of setup moves, which can prove fatal should the opponent decide to immediately attack Iron Bundle rather than set up. These analyses were written before Pokemon Home's update for Generation 9. As a result, some of the content may now be outdated as we adjust for the new metagame."

  "Iron Crown": {
    "name": "Iron Crown",
    "text": "Iron Crown serves as a strong offensive pivot and sturdy check to a bevy of special attackers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Enamorus courtesy of its well-rounded stats, good defensive profile, and solid offensive movepool alongside a great pivoting option in Volt Switch. Tachyon Cutter's multi-hit properties allow it to bypass Glimmora's Focus Sash to OHKO it before it can set up any entry hazards. Future Sight's delayed damage puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the opposing team, since Dark-types switching in to block Future Sight or Steel-types and special walls trying to sponge the attack will have to survive powerful physical attacks from teammates like Great Tusk, Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, Zamazenta, and Weavile; Psychic Noise offers lower but more immediate damage while simultaneously nullifying recovery attempts from Gholdengo, Blissey, Corviknight, Garganacl, and Clodsire, allowing Iron Crown and its teammates to force significant damage against these threats. Focus Blast rounds out Iron Crown's coverage by hitting Kingambit, Ting-Lu, Roaring Moon, and Tera Steel Clodsire super effectively, and it is also its strongest attack against opposing Iron Crown. Volt Switch allows Iron Crown to capitalize on its ability to force out most special attackers and gain momentum for its team and has great synergy with Future Sight by safely pivoting in the aforementioned powerful physical attackers that can take advantage of the chip damage or switches it forces. Assault Vest greatly boosts Iron Crown's special bulk, allowing it to better handle special attackers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Choice Specs is a decent alternative for more offensive teams, boosting Iron Crown's damage output to staggering levels, letting it even outright 2HKO Blissey with Tera Fighting Focus Blast. However, this comes at the cost of greatly compromising its special bulk, being 2HKOed by Iron Valiant's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock; it also prevents Iron Crown from switching moves. Tera Fighting turns Iron Crown's weakness to Dark-type attacks into a resistance, allowing it to survive Kingambit's Sucker Punch in a pinch and to play mindgames against Roaring Moon while letting it 2HKO Ting-Lu and physically defensive Corviknight with Focus Blast; Tera Fairy also offers a Dark resistance, but the Dragon immunity, Fighting resistance, and Fairy neutrality it provides allow Iron Crown to better check Dragapult and more reliably handle mixed and physical Iron Valiant sets without compromising its ability to check Calm Mind variants as heavily. Iron Crown is best run on bulky offense teams, which can both cover Iron Crown's defensive shortcomings and maintain a similar level of offensive pressure, often in the form of additional pivoting options to maintain momentum. Hisuian Samurott is a spectacular teammate; it can form a VoltTurn core with Iron Crown using Flip Turn, reliably set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge, and even remove Heavy-Duty Boots with its strong STAB Knock Off to allow the duo to rack up massive amounts of lasting damage through Spikes and Future Sight or Psychic Noise. The two share excellent defensive synergy, as Hisuian Samurott's Ghost and Dark resistances cover Dragapult, Gholdengo, and opposing Hisuian Samurott while Iron Crown's Grass and Fairy resistances cover Rillaboom and Iron Valiant. Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off have impeccable synergy with Future Sight, and Hisuian Samurott's Razor Shell hits Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit very hard, rendering Iron Crown's Future Sight much more difficult to switch in against. Landorus-T is another great teammate; it also forms a powerful VoltTurn core with Iron Crown, can blanket check most physical attackers with Intimidate and Rocky Helmet to complement Iron Crown's ability to blanket check most special attackers with Assault Vest, can set up Stealth Rock, and the two also boast impeccable defensive synergy courtesy of Iron Crown checking Ice Beam users like Deoxys-S and Landorus-T checking physical Iron Valiant and Heatran. Together, Iron Crown, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T form an extremely powerful core that resists every type in the game, utilizes multiple pivoting options, sets up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and can blanket check many physical and special attackers alike. Calm Mind Primarina is a good teammate that can run Psychic Noise itself, allowing Iron Crown to more freely run Future Sight, and can take advantage of Iron Crown's ability to wear down teams over time to set up for a late-game sweep once threats like Encore Iron Valiant are dealt with. Physically defensive Moltres is another solid teammate, as it can reliably check most physical attackers by spreading burn with Will-O-Wisp and Flame Body and heavily punishes Dark-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott and Steel-types like Gholdengo aiming to switch into Future Sight, and appreciates Iron Crown's ability to temporarily keep special attackers like Deoxys-S and Walking Wake at bay. Kingambit itself makes for a strong teammate, as with Iron Crown's Future Sight support, Kingambit has a much easier time both finding opportunities to set up with Swords Dance and muscle past physical walls like Dondozo and Alomomola, which are quickly overwhelmed by the combination of Future Sight and powerful Dark-type attacks possibly boosted further by Black Glasses, Tera Dark, and Supreme Overlord. Kingambit additionally resists Ghost- and Dark-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo and opposing Kingambit lacking Low Kick, which Iron Crown greatly appreciates. Zamazenta and Weavile also greatly appreciate both Iron Crown's Future Sight support and its pivoting capabilities, allowing them to be brought in safely and giving them opportunities to fire off a powerful Body Press or Knock Off that, when paired with Future Sight, can prove nearly impossible to switch in against. Leveraging its high Special Attack and good coverage, Choice Specs Iron Crown is a potent wallbreaker that can 2HKO a number of the metagame's defensive options like Garganacl and Gliscor. Tachyon Cutter being a multi-hit move lets Iron Crown OHKO Focus Sash Glimmora without activating Toxic Debris, break Multiscale on Dragonite, and deal significant damage to Landorus-T. Psyshock is preferred to let Iron Crown take on specially defensive walls like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and Blissey, while Psychic Noise can be used instead to prevent Pokemon like Corviknight and Zapdos from healing in front of it. Volt Switch lets Iron Crown pivot out of Pokemon it would otherwise struggle against while also dealing significant damage to the likes of Primarina and Alomomola. Focus Blast helps Iron Crown deal with Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads and is its best option to damage Ting-Lu. Tera Steel increases the power of Tachyon Cutter, letting it 2HKO offensive Gholdengo variants and OHKO fully HP invested Landorus-T most of the time, while Tera Fighting Focus Blast guarantees a 2HKO on Ting-Lu, as well as OHKOes Ogerpon-W most of the time and guarantees an OHKO on Cinderace. Both Tera types also remove Iron Crown's weakness to Dark-type moves, improving its matchup against offensive Dark-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott. Choice Specs Iron Crown needs physically offensive teammates like Zamazenta and Dragonite that can reliably remove specially defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Blissey. In return, they benefit from Iron Crown being able to handle physical walls like Clefable and Dondozo. Because Iron Crown will be consistently locked into one move, it's easier to revenge kill, so it needs defensive teammates such as Primarina and Landorus-T that can switch into faster offensive Pokemon like Darkrai and Roaring Moon while also providing pivot support for Iron Crown. Alomomola is another good teammate for Iron Crown, pivoting it into favorable matchups and keeping it healthy with Wish. Gholdengo is especially annoying for Iron Crown, as it resists both of its STAB moves and can easily heal off damage, so teammates like Kingambit and Great Tusk that can easily take care of it are useful. Finally, Iron Crown benefits from entry hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott that can soften up foes and allow it to clean them up easier."

  "Iron Jugulis": {
    "name": "Iron Jugulis",
    "text": "These analyses were written before Pokemon Home's update for Generation 9. As a result, some of the content may now be outdated as we adjust for the new metagame. Iron Jugulis is a potent sweeper due to its stellar offensive typing and excellent Quark Drive-boosted Speed, which allow it to revenge kill fast threats such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, Iron Valiant, and Armarouge after a Weak Armor boost. Hurricane destroys many offensive Pokemon that can take Dark Pulse, including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Quaquaval, and Volcarona. Taunt allows Iron Jugulis to function as a dangerous stallbreaker by shutting down passive walls such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. It also prevents Slowking from pivoting with Chilly Reception and threats such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Roaring Moon from setting up. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Fire Blast trades some of Flamethrower's accuracy for more power, most notably OHKOing the aforementioned Steel-types with Tera Fire. Alternatively, Earth Power OHKOes Iron Moth and lands a stronger hit on Clodsire, Garganacl, Cinderace, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Tera Fire strengthens Flamethrower or Fire Blast and gives Iron Jugulis crucial resistances to Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Iron Jugulis is best used on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to trouble stall teams and keep fast sweepers in check. Due to its only decent power, Iron Jugulis greatly appreciates entry hazards from teammates such as Glimmora, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Garchomp to wear down its checks. Additionally, Iron Jugulis's Stealth Rock weakness makes entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads very valuable partners; they can also pressure Clodsire and Iron Moth to free up Iron Jugulis to run a Fire-type move. Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom and Dragapult can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game. In return, Iron Jugulis threatens Amoonguss and provides a valuable Ghost resistance to take on threats such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark more easily."

  "Iron Moth": {
    "name": "Iron Moth",
    "text": "With titanic Special Attack and superb Speed, Iron Moth is a powerful cleaner and solid wallbreaker that can run away with games after a single Fiery Dance boost while also providing offense with a way to absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora. Iron Moth's excellent STAB combination is complemented perfectly by Tera Blast Ground, giving Iron Moth its strongest option against Galarian Slowking and Clodsire while preventing it from being walled by Heatran and Skeledirge. Tera Blast Ghost can also be used to similarly hit Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge while also targetting Dragapult. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam lets Iron Moth hit Roaring Moon and Dragapult hard while reducing its reliance on Tera for coverage. Energy Ball is another strong coverage option that targets Garganacl and bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Dondozo; both Energy Ball and Dazzling Gleam give Iron Moth strong coverage against Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Substitute helps Iron Moth avoid Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Raging Bolt's Thunderclap while also vastly improving its matchup against Galarian Slowking, whose pivot set is unable to break Iron Moth's Substitute without relying on Future Sight, and Garganacl, which cannot break Iron Moth's Substitute with Salt Cure after it Terastallizes. Iron Moth can instead opt to run a 4 attack set; with Tera Blast Ground and Dazzling Gleam, Iron Moth maximizes its coverage while still hitting Dragon-types like Dragapult and Roaring Moon for super effective damage. Combining Dazzling Gleam and Energy Ball alleviates Iron Moth's reliance on Tera, although this leaves it completely walled by both Heatran and Skeledirge. Psychic is an additional option that can be paired with Dazzling Gleam for coverage that can hit Clodsire for super effective damage without Iron Moth needing to Terastallize, although it still cannot break through Clodsire without it first being significantly weakened. With the given spread, Iron Moth's Booster Energy gives it a Quark Drive boost to its Speed; the remaining EVs maximize its Special Attack while 124 Defense EVs help patch up its poor Defense, allowing it to survive a Sucker Punch from Kingambit with 5 Supreme Overlord boosts and a Close Combat from +2 Iron Valiant. Defensively, Tera Ground gives Iron Moth an immunity to Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and both Galarian Slowking and Dragapult's Thunder Wave. Tera Ghost provides an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Blissey's Seismic Toss, and Great Tusk's Rapid Spin in a pinch, and pairs well with Substitute to help mitigate its weakness to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tera Fairy powers up Dazzling Gleam into an additional STAB option that OHKOes Dragapult and Hisuian Samurott, along with securing a 2HKO on max HP Zamazenta and Dragonite through Multiscale, while defensively, it provides a resistance to Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Finally, Tera Grass can be used to strengthen Energy Ball, such as nailing the OHKO on both Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott, while defensively granting Iron Moth a resistance to Ground-type attacks such as Gliscor and Garganacl's Earthquake that can allow it to simply attack or set up a Substitute for free, a quality that is also appreciated against Alomomola. Iron Moth is a great pick for offense and hyper offense teams, not only bringing its qualities as a fast cleaner to the table but also providing teams with a valuable Toxic Spikes absorber. In particular, hyper offense using lead Hisuian Samurott often triggers opposing Glimmora's Toxic Debris; this makes Iron Moth a great partner to Hisuian Samurott while also enabling other Pokemon weak to Toxic Spikes such as Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Iron Defense Zamazenta. In return, Iron Moth greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott itself along with Stealth Rock setters like Glimmora and Landorus-T to help weaken Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking that it struggles to deal with. This highlights one of Iron Moth's shortcomings, as its initial power is not strong enough to break through bulkier walls like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Blissey, while without boosts from Fiery Dance, it cannot clean against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Partners like Raging Bolt and Primarina that can weaken or eliminate bulkier targets for Iron Moth are much appreciated, while Iron Valiant provides an alternative form of speed for hyper offense that can also weaken shared checks like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire, a quality particularly useful for Iron Moth lacking Tera Blast Ground. Strong physical attackers such as Roaring Moon and Ogerpon-W make for great partners due to their ability to take advantage of these special walls, using them as opportunities to accrue boosts. Kingambit can also provide an alternative wincon that enjoys Iron Moth threatening checks like Skarmory and weakening targets like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and even Great Tusk that can be forced in to revenge kill it. Iron Moth is great counterplay to Sticky Web teams using Ribombee, which give it two free Fiery Dances from lead; however, Iron Moth is also a good fit on these teams, with support from Sticky Web allowing it to outrun other Booster Energy Pokemon that could otherwise revenge kill it like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder. Iron Moth also fits on other forms of offense; Rillaboom provides Grassy Terrain support that can let it avoid the OHKO from Gliscor's Earthquake while boosting the power of Energy Ball, and Rillaboom can also bring it in safely with U-turn on passive targets like Skarmory and Corviknight. Meanwhile, Torkoal's sun greatly enhances Iron Moth's wallbreaking power, with sun-boosted Fiery Dances 3HKOing Galarian Slowking. Unfortunately, Iron Moth's frailty is exacerbated by its weakness to entry hazards, and so Great Tusk makes for a strong partner that also appreciates Iron Moth's ability to threaten common switch-ins like Corviknight and Skarmory. Hatterene is another partner that can help keep hazards off the field for Iron Moth, while Hatterene itself is able to help weaken Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Heatran for Iron Moth to later break through."

  "Iron Treads": {
    "name": "Iron Treads",
    "text": "Iron Treads serves as a major player in the entry hazard metagame and an excellent lead for offense teams due to its ability to remove hazards from opposing leads like Glimmora and Deoxys-S with Rapid Spin. Its Steel typing blocks Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and it naturally outspeeds Landorus-T, which can use Taunt to prevent hazards from slower leads. Iron Treads can also drop Stealth Rock for Volt Switch, changing its role from a hazard lead to an offensive pivot that can pivot out against Pokemon like Ogerpon-W that otherwise would use it as setup fodder while keeping Rapid Spin utility. Ice Spinner allows Iron Treads to hit Gliscor and Landorus-T, while Iron Head can be used instead to deal with Pokemon like Enamorus, Hatterene, and Tera Fairy Raging Bolt. Iron Treads can also run a specially-based set with Earth Power and either Steel Beam or Volt Switch as its attacks with an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and a Timid nature; Earth Power allows Iron Treads to KO Glimmora without activating Toxic Debris, while Steel Beam's self-KO allows it to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, Defog from Corviknight, and gives safe entry for an incoming teammate. Booster Energy's Speed boost allows Iron Treads to set Stealth Rock against Deoxys-S, grants it more opportunities to use Rapid Spin, and allows it to pick off various otherwise faster Pokemon, notably Cinderace, which could otherwise use Court Change before Iron Treads could attack. Alternatively, Eject Button can be used on teams for additional momentum at the cost of effectiveness in the hazard game. Tera Ghost gives Iron Treads an immunity to Fighting and Normal, blanking Fighting-type moves that would otherwise KO it, including Close Combat from Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant, and preventing Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, opposing Iron Treads, and Torkoal to keep its hazards. Iron Treads is an excellent teammate on offensive teams, such as sun and rain, that can support various sweepers by denying entry hazards, setting its own hazards, or pivoting. It also checks Raging Bolt lacking Weather Ball. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult provide Rapid Spin immunities, strengthening the team's advantage in the hazard game, while also checking Iron Defense Zamazenta, a dangerous sweeper that can easily find setup opportunities on Iron Treads. Alongside these Ghost-types, Fairy-, Grass-, and Water-type Pokemon that outspeed Great Tusk including Iron Valiant, Serperior, and Ogerpon-W can be used to prevent Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin without burning Tera, and they also appreciate Iron Treads's ability to keep hazards off the field, as they can't afford to use Heavy-Duty Boots on most teams. Kingambit is also a good teammate, as it is a hyper offense staple and appreciates Iron Treads enabling the offense of its teammates for Kingambit to clean up late-game. Setup sweepers with Knock Off like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W increase the effectiveness of Stealth Rock by removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers to assist teammates with breaking through walls such as Dondozo and Garganacl. When using Volt Switch or Eject Button, Iron Treads is excellent on rain teams, checking Raging Bolt and Dragapult and ensuring Pelipper and Barraskewda can pivot in and out freely to use the limited turns of rain are used to the fullest extent. It can also serve a similar role on sun teams, checking Raging Bolt and Glimmora while being able to regain the momentum that Torkoal loses and providing a second hazard remover."

  "Iron Valiant": {
    "name": "Iron Valiant",
    "text": "Iron Valiant is a premier wallbreaker and setup sweeper that uses Calm Mind to boost its attacks to OHKO foes such as Kyurem and Deoxys-S. Shadow Ball is a powerful coverage option, allowing Iron Valiant to damage Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking that would otherwise be difficult to break through. Psyshock is a way for Iron Valiant to damage special walls like Blissey and Clodsire that it's unable to break through otherwise, as well as a solid option against Volcarona. Encore is able to stop opposing sweepers from setting up, locking them into setup moves, thus forcing them to switch out. Encore also breaks through walls by locking them out of their recovery moves, such as by trapping Clodsire into Stealth Rock and denying its access to Recover. In addition, Encore gives Iron Valiant an opportunity to set up additional boosts with Calm Mind and stops late-game Kingambit by locking it into Sucker Punch after it's knocked out a teammate. Vacuum Wave is an alternative option that lets Iron Valiant OHKO Kingambit after a Calm Mind as well as gives it priority to finish off weakened faster foes such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and Dragon Dance-boosted Roaring Moon. Tera Ghost boosts the damage of Shadow Ball, allowing a 2HKO on Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge as well as getting an OHKO on Gholdengo after a Calm Mind. Tera Steel, on the other hand, is a purely defensive option, giving Iron Valiant sudden resistances to every type it was previously weak to, making threatening attacks like Sludge Bomb from Galarian Slowking and Darkrai non-issues. This also allows it the opportunity to survive a hit it otherwise wouldn't, such as Kingambit's Iron Head and Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and revenge kill afterwards or secure another boost from Calm Mind. Tera Fairy not only boosts Moonblast's damage, which guarantees a knockout on Kyurem and Zamazenta, but also removes Iron Valiant's weakness to opposing Fairy-type attacks from Enamorus and opposing Iron Valiant. Iron Valiant is able to support offensive teams with its incredible Speed and ability to set up and sweep. It synergizes well with other sweepers on offensive teams, forming solid cores that can cover each other's weaknesses. Some of these sweepers include Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Gouging Fire, which can all boost and take out foes that Iron Valiant struggles with like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. In return, Iron Valiant can cover physically defensive Pokemon that these teammates would have trouble breaking through, such as Dondozo and Zamazenta. Iron Valiant is vulnerable to certain Pokemon that it isn't able to immediately deal with by boosting up and knocking them out. Gholdengo in particular is able to take all of Iron Valiant's hits even if it's running Shadow Ball and immediately knock it out with Make It Rain. Kingambit is an excellent partner that can take out Gholdengo as well as force out other threats to Iron Valiant such as Galarian Slowking; the synergy between Sucker Punch and Booster Energy allows them to secure revenge kills that the other cannot, such as Iron Valiant taking care of Walking Wake and Kingambit beating Iron Boulder. Iron Valiant can also form overload cores with similar Pokemon to wear down their shared checks; Ogerpon-W can help with this thanks to its access to Taunt and Encore, while other Calm Mind sweepers like Enamorus and Primarina can help wear down checks like Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo. Raging Bolt is also a solid teammate option that can take on Primarina and Enamorus thanks to Thunderclap; in return, Iron Valiant can take care of faster Dragon-types that threaten Raging Bolt. When used on bulkier team structures, Iron Valiant is very susceptible to being worn down by entry hazards over the course of a game; having a partner with Rapid Spin like Great Tusk can help relieve this pressure. Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T appreciate having a fast, powerful sweeper that they can get in safely, allowing Iron Valiant to switch in on Pokemon like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Kyurem without taking damage. Swords Dance Iron Valiant establishes itself as a dangerous sweeper in the OU metagame due to its immense Attack stat along with its excellent coverage and Speed, bolstered further by Booster Energy. Due to Iron Valiant's diversity in sets, Swords Dance Iron Valiant creates openings for it to sweep or gain a great advantage against Pokemon that would normally check its more common specially offensive set, such as Galarian Slowking. Iron Valiant works best as a late-game sweeper, picking off opposing foes and punishing switches by setting up a Swords Dance, and Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking for great damage and offers great utility. Encore gives Iron Valiant more opportunities to set up by locking a passive Pokemon into one move or threatening offensive setup Pokemon such as Kingambit and Volcarona by locking them into Sucker Punch or Quiver Dance, respectively. However, Iron Valiant may choose to use Spirit Break over Encore to ease the matchup against Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Raging Bolt, and Walking Wake as well as hitting Fairy-types such as Enamorus, Hatterene, and opposing Iron Valiant. Iron Valiant's use of Booster Energy allows it to outspeed most Pokemon, with the drawback of being single-use. Swords Dance Iron Valiant's choice of Terastallization is between Dark and Steel, with the former boosting Iron Valiant's Knock Off even harder, most notably guaranteeing an OHKO against Volcarona, one of its offensive checks, after a Swords Dance. Additionally, Tera Dark Iron Valiant can absorb a Future Sight in a pinch and still resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch to avoid being revenge killed. Similarly, Tera Steel Iron Valiant lets it easily set up on its common checks such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, and it can take advantage of its new resistances against common revenge killers such as Make it Rain Gholdengo, opposing Iron Valiant, Extreme Speed Dragonite, Grassy Glide Rillaboom, and Acrobatics Roaring Moon. Iron Valiant's incredible Attack and Speed as well as its access to Swords Dance makes it a staple on hyper offense teams. Swords Dance Iron Valiant being a great lure against Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo opens winning endgame paths for Pokemon walled by the two of them, such as Volcarona and Zamazenta. Iron Valiant is also an amazing Kingambit answer, which teammates such as Dragapult and Gholdengo appreciate. Swords Dance Iron Valiant struggles to deal with physical walls, such as Gliscor, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Landorus-T, which hinder its ability to sweep and get the most out of its value offensively. Teammates such as Ogerpon-W, Dragapult, Hatterene, and Volcarona deal with the aforementioned walls by outright threatening them or turning them into setup fodder. Entry hazards make Iron Valiant more prone to being revenge killed, making teammates that remove them such as Cinderace, Glimmora, and Great Tusk synergize with it very well on an offensive team. Iron Valiant also enjoys hazards from its own teammates, making its cleaning easier as well as having great synergy with Knock Off, which removes important items from Pokemon such as Heavy-Duty Boots Skeledirge, Rocky Helmet Skarmory, and Leftovers Zamazenta. Great entry hazard leads such as Hisuian Samurott, Glimmora, and Deoxys-S complement Iron Valiant well. With its great coverage, high attacking stats, and amazing Speed backed up by Speed Booster Energy, Iron Valiant is one of the tier's best revenge killers. Iron Valiant's Moonblast hits most Pokemon in OU for at least neutral damage, while Close Combat complements it by dealing super effective damage against Kingambit, Heatran, Excadrill, and the occasional Blissey. Knock Off allows Iron Valiant to threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge, which resist both of its STAB moves, and it provides utility for the rest of its team by removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots. Alternatively, Psyshock can be used to threaten Clodsire, Iron Moth, and Toxapex. Encore can be used to lock foes into setup moves such as Volcarona's Quiver Dance, Gouging Fire's Dragon Dance, and Zamazenta's Iron Defense, as well as recovery and status moves such as Skeledirge's Slack Off, Corviknight's Roost, and Gliscor's Protect; Encore is also effective at locking Raging Bolt into Thunderclap and Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott into Sucker Punch, granting one of Iron Valiant's teammates a free switch. Destiny Bond is another option that can lure unsuspecting foes, particularly setup sweepers that Iron Valiant can't reliably OHKO, such as Volcarona, Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Calm Mind Hatterene looking to KO Iron Valiant only to also faint in the process. Destiny Bond is particularly effective because offensive Pokemon will often respect the possibility of Iron Valiant using Encore to lock them into an undesirable move and attack straight away instead, falling victims to Destiny Bond. Booster Energy grants Iron Valiant a one-time Speed boost needed for it to outspeed otherwise faster foes such as Weavile, Dragapult, Zamazenta, and unboosted Roaring Moon. Tera Steel turns all of Iron Valiant's weaknesses into resistances, such as Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb and Future Sight, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Roaring Moon's Acrobatics, and Enamorus's and opposing Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Steel also grants Iron Valiant resistances to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, preventing them from revenge killing it. Tera Fairy can be used instead to power up Iron Valiant's Moonblast, allowing it to OHKO Kyurem and Raging Bolt, as well as Enamorus after one round of Stealth Rock. Tera Dark is another option that power ups Iron Valiant's Knock Off to further threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge. Mixed Iron Valiant is best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill foes and whose fast-paced nature allows Iron Valiant to make the most out of Booster Energy. Iron Valiant's great coverage also allows it to act as a potent wallbreaker against slower-paced teams that it naturally outspeeds. Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and offensive Great Tusk enjoy Iron Valiant's ability to threaten opposing Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Zamazenta on their weaker Special Defense, while in return, they can threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge, which can stop Iron Valiant. Dragapult is another Pokemon able to threaten the aforementioned foes, and it appreciates Iron Valiant handling Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Kingambit, which can be troublesome for Dragapult. Raging Bolt benefits from Iron Valiant's good matchup into Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Excadrill, as well as faster Dragon-types in Dragapult, Kyurem, and Walking Wake. Raging Bolt can in turn threaten Torkoal, Primarina, and Brave Bird Corviknight, which can win the one-on-one against Iron Valiant. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Glimmora, Landorus-T, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S provides Iron Valiant with the extra chip it needs to get past foes. In turn, Iron Valiant's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, particularly Volcarona and Skeledirge, making them susceptible to said hazards and opening the path for teammates like Rillaboom to sweep late-game."

  "Jirachi": {
    "name": "Jirachi",
    "text": "Jirachi is one of the most dynamic Pokemon in SV RU with a plethora of sets at its disposal. Its diverse movepool gives it access to fantastic utility options such as Stealth Rock, U-turn, and Encore; potent offensive tools such as Iron Head and Calm Mind; and incredible special coverage including moves like Thunder and Aura Sphere, meaning that Jirachi is able to fit almost any role that its team requires; this has the added benefit of making its set difficult to discern on Team Preview. However, in true \"Jack-of-all-Trades, Master of None\" fashion, Jirachi can sometimes find itself outclassed in the plethora of roles it can fill. Its lack of immediate recovery and unspecialized defenses render it inferior to physical walls like Hippowdon and Chesnaught and specially defensive ones like Empoleon. Jirachi's weakness to Dark, in particular Knock Off, holds it back quite a bit from being a reliable entry hazard setter and defensive sponge. On many teams, Jirachi competes for the Psychic-type position with other potent Pokemon like Slowbro and Reuniclus that may fill roles such as spreading status and sweeping with Calm Mind more effectively; hence, opting for Jirachi incurs a noticeable opportunity cost. As a setup sweeper, Jirachi's inability to boost its Speed can leave it fearful of revenge killers like Hisuian Zoroark, Mienshao, and Terrakion. Lastly, Jirachi's relatively weak offensive power means that it can often struggle to make progress, even with a Choice item. Utility Jirachi is truly a jack of all trades in RU with its evenly distributed stats, useful part-Steel typing, and access to a litany of support options. Body Slam capitalizes on Serene Grace to spread paralysis at a high rate without being blocked by Taunt. With paralysis and Iron Head flinch chance factored in, Jirachi has a staggering 70% chance to immobilize a foe. Jirachi's final moveslot is flexible and can be fitted to accommodate the specific needs of the team. Encore provides Jirachi with a reliable option to discourage slower setup sweepers such as Slowbro and Fezandipiti from freely boosting while also giving Jirachi a manner of punishing passive play, being able to lock Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Empoleon into a recovery or entry hazard setting move. U-turn provides Jirachi with a pivoting, letting it bring in frailer teammates as well as giving it an out from being trapped by Magnet Pull Magnezone. Wish can be used as a support option to heal up teammates on low health, as well as giving Jirachi a somewhat reliable recovery option itself. Leftovers gives Jirachi a source of passive recovery, improving its longevity. 224 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature ensure that Jirachi can outspeed threats such as Mimikyu and Krookodile. The remaining EVs are invested into Special Defense to better take on Noivern's Flamethrower and Yanmega's Bug Buzz. Jirachi's Tera options are also quite flexible and can be changed to suit the needs of the team. Tera Water is useful, as it can help Jirachi emergency check strong Water-types in the tier such as Volcanion and Barraskewda. Tera Steel provides Jirachi a stronger Iron Head and also removes its weakness to Dark, making it less susceptible to moves such as Cyclizar's Knock Off and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Tera Fairy can be used to flip Jirachi's weakness to Dark into a key resistance, as well as giving it useful resistances to several forms of priority in the tier like Slither Wing's First Impression. Tera Fairy also removes its weakness to Ground, making matchups into Krookodile and Flygon much more favorable. Utility Jirachi can fit on a slew of both Pokemon and team structures. For example, Jirachi is an excellent fit on an offensive playstyle like rain where it doubles as a Stealth Rock setter as well as a general special sponge, covering for problematic revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gardevoir. Bulky offense and balance teams also appreciate Jirachi, as it brings a host of useful traits such as being a Stealth Rock setter, a pivot, and a great blanket check to common threats such as Fezandipiti, Noivern, and opposing Jirachi. With how Cyclizar covers Jirachi's weaknesses to Ghost and Fire, it is a great partner; in return Jirachi can switch into Fairy-type attacks for it. On top of that, these two in tandem also create a formidable pivot core for. Other teammates that can spread paralysis such as Slowbro and Thundurus also work as great partners with Jirachi, as they can slow down the opposing team giving Jirachi more chances to paraflinch through foes. Slower, frailer wallbreakers like Crawdaunt and Conkeldurr greatly benefit from Jirachi's ability to slow down the opponent's team through paralysis, generate safe entry points with U-turn, and provide support through Wish or Encore. VoltTurn cores with Thundurus and Fezandipiti can help keep up momentum and pressure, helping rack up entry hazard chip damage on the opponent's team. Calm Mind Jirachi is difficult to take down thanks to its typing and natural bulk, which let it stack Calm Mind boosts easily against a large portion of the tier. Psychic Noise prevents slower defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Reuniclus, and Fezandipiti from healing so Jirachi can eventually beat them. Grass Knot smacks many of the defensive Water- and Ground-type Pokemon that would normally handle other variants of Jirachi well, such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, Slowbro, and Gastrodon. Aura Sphere provides a coverage move that hits Dark- and Steel-type Pokemon like Bisharp, Hisuian Goodra, and Magnezone super effectively. Thunder nails Water-type Pokemon neutral to Grass Knot such as Gyarados, Volcanion, and Empoleon while boasting a nice chance to paralyze the foe and being a great option versus rain teams. Jirachi can usually afford missing a Thunder thanks to its bulk. Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types such as Armarouge, Reuniclus, and opposing Jirachi, which are otherwise safe from Jirachi's other options. Leftovers allows Jirachi to recover health throughout a game thanks to the many switch-in opportunities its bulk and typing offers it. Calm Mind Jirachi will often stay on the field for many turns as it sets up and chips at the opponent's team, so Leftovers recovery will easily pile up. Expert Belt can be used on more aggressive teams to offset the middling immediate power of this set, but be wary that Jirachi will be worn down more quickly. 224 Speed EVs allow Jirachi to outspeed Mimikyu and Krookodile. Tera Water allows Jirachi to remove its Ground, Ghost, and Dark weaknesses, as well as letting it resist Armarouge's Armor Cannon and Volcanion's Flamethrower. Tera Fairy transforms Jirachi's Dark weakness into a resistance to handily tank the likes of Bisharp's Sucker Punch and Krookodile's Knock Off while being an overall fantastic defensive typing. Tera Fighting can be used in conjunction with Expert Belt and Aura Sphere to directly threaten high damage on Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon while being Jirachi's best Tera type against Bisharp. Offensive Calm Mind Jirachi works on a wide variety of teams, from offense to balance teams, looking for a bulky Pokemon that can weaken common balance cores while providing defensive value through its natural bulk coupled with resistances to Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks and an immunity to poison and Poison-type attacks. Levitate Galarian Weezing provides an immunity to Ground and a resistance to Dark coupled with decent physical bulk and spreads burn through Will-O-Wisp to help Jirachi withstand physical attacks much better. Other physical walls, like Hippowdon, Amoonguss, and Gligar, can likewise handle physical breakers such as Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile that Jirachi struggles taking hits from. Krookodile is a great partner, acting as a switch-in to Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, fulfilling the entry hazard setter role, removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from defensive Pokemon, and denying recovery attempts from foes with Taunt, which Jirachi can capitalize on. Other more sturdy switch-ins to Ghost-type Pokemon like Basculegion-F and Gengar include Assault Vest Hisuian Goodra and Assault Vest Cyclizar. Fighting-type breakers such as Galarian Zapdos, Slither Wing, and Mienshao pair well with Jirachi due to their ability to threaten Steel- and Dark-type Pokemon that do well against Jirachi, especially if choosing not to run Aura Sphere, while Jirachi can switch into the Psychic- and Fairy-type attacks targeted at them in return. Because this set has difficulty pulling its weight against hyper offense teams, Pokemon strong against the archetype like Bisharp, Slither Wing, and Umbreon are recommended. Choice Scarf Jirachi provides speed control and offensive pivoting for many team structures. Defensively, Jirachi is a great team presence because of its great defensive typing and natural bulk, with 100 base stats across the board providing it with the longevity needed to switch into several attacks for its teammates. Iron Head is the most reliable STAB option for Jirachi to use since it has adequate base power, is neutral into a majority of the metagame, and boasts a high flinch rate. U-turn is a safe pivot move, allowing powerful partners to come in freely. Choice Scarf Jirachi uses Trick to hinder would-be checks like Amoonguss and Hippowdon, which can also greatly help teammates that struggle against these defensive walls like Revavroom and Terrakion. Healing Wish can give a second opportunity to a teammate that may otherwise not have enough health to get back into a game reliably. Using a Jolly nature with max Attack and Speed enables Jirachi to outspeed a majority of the tier, tying with other Choice Scarf users like Galarian Zapdos or Dragon Dance Salamence after a Speed boost. Tera Steel is run to maximize its damage output with Iron Head, which can allow Jirachi to potentially flinch its way through the opponent's physical wall, along with hitting several notable benchmarks like OHKOing Terrakion and 2HKOing Noivern and Galarian Zapdos. Choice Scarf Jirachi is primarily seen in offense and balance structures, where it can pack speed control, support, disruption, and a solid defensive profile into one slot. Jirachi is one of the best switch-ins to Fairy- and Poison-types in the tier, as well as having key resistances to Dragon- and Psychic-type attacks, making it a reliable option to take a Gardevoir or Fezandipiti Moonblast or Salamence Outrage. Teammates weak to Fairy-type moves, such as strong Dragon- or Fighting-types like Salamence and Terrakion, are grateful for Jirachi's presence on the team to fall back on. Taking advantage of Choice Scarf Jirachi's ability to hinder and chip at physically defensive walls like Amoonguss, Hippowdon, and Palossand, teammates such as Revavroom, Mimikyu, and Terrakion can position themselves to set up reliably. Teammates that lack recovery such as Armarouge and Galarian Zapdos can function as both mid-game breakers and late-game cleaners when paired with Healing Wish support from Jirachi. Meteor Beam allows Jirachi to compress a setup move and coverage for Pokemon like Volcanion and Thundurus into one moveslot, but it has the drawback of being mostly useless for the rest of the game after Power Herb is used up. Cosmic Power + Weakness Policy is sometimes able to catch opponents off-guard and pull off a devastating sweep; however, it is heavily reliant on the matchup and only works if the opponent doesn't have or has exhausted their anti-setup options such as phazing, Encore, and Trick. Future Sight and Doom Desire can be used alongside wallbreakers such as Slither Wing and Terrakion that appreciate assistance against Poison- and Fairy-type switch-ins. Jirachi can also run a Choice Band set with Meteor Mash, capitalizing on Serene Grace giving it a 40% chance to boost its Attack. Contact Effects: Being able to fish for flinches, chip damage, and status by freely clicking Iron Head and Body Slam is one of Jirachi's many advantages. Therefore, the presence of Rocky Helmet users such as Hippowdon, Chesnaught, and Amoonguss on practically every bulky team is detrimental to Jirachi, as they prevent it from spamming its physical moves. Static Bellibolt in particular can punish Jirachi greatly by possibly paralyzing it, with Bellibolt itself being immune to Body Slam paralysis and taking practically no damage from Iron Head. Talonflame is similarly able to deter and punish Jirachi's weak attacks with Flame Body. Fast wallbreakers: Faster offensive Pokemon like Gengar and Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Zapdos and Krookodile can easily threaten Jirachi with their powerful attacks, which gives them an opportunity to take it out or blow holes through its team. Dark-types: Dark-type Pokemon like Bisharp, Crawdaunt, and Intimidate Krookodile take little damage from Jirachi's Iron Head and threaten it back with a strong Dark-type attack. Umbreon is particularly effective at checking Jirachi thanks to its amazing bulk, Inner Focus, and Foul Play dealing decent damage to even special Jirachi. Fire-types: Fire-type Pokemon like Armarouge, Rotom-H, and Volcanion can capitalize on Jirachi's inability to deal with them by firing off a devastating attack or setting up to boost their firepower at little risk to themselves. However, they have to be careful not to let Calm Mind Jirachi accrue enough Special Defense boosts such that Jirachi becomes able to survive an attack and take them out."

  "Jolteon": {
    "name": "Jolteon",
    "text": "With Speed only eclipsed by Hisuian Electrode backed up with good power, Jolteon establishes itself as a premier fast pivot. Its fast Volt Switch makes it an easy candidate on VoltTurn teams, and its adequate coverage with Alluring Voice and Shadow Ball discourages specially bulky Pokemon like Virizion and Mesprit from switching into it. Jolteon's decent set variety means it can be a deadly Calm Mind sweeper or a dangerous wallbreaker with Choice Specs. Jolteon's defensive utility with Volt Absorb and passable special bulk also makes it a situational switch-in to special attackers like Articuno, Cramorant, and Rotom. However, the lacking power of its coverage moves causes it to struggle quite hard against specially defensive Pokemon like Snorlax and Dudunsparce as well as Ground-types like Rhydon. Said Ground-types make Jolteon quite reliant on Terastalization to bypass its checks, which causes it to demand for more team support. Jolteon also faces competition from Hisuian Electrode, which boasts higher Speed and an additional Grass subtyping that allow it to beat Ground-types instead of being walled by them. After one Calm Mind boost, Jolteon's Thunderbolt 2HKOes unboosted Orthworm. Volt Switch maintains momentum and allows it to escape bad matchups like Snorlax, Regirock, and Virizion. Jolteon's fourth moveslot is flexible and can depend on the team's need for coverage. Alluring Voice discourages certain Grass-types like Virizion and Hisuian Decidueye from switching in and also targets Dragon-types like Dipplin and Alolan Exeggutor that would be comfortable switching into its Electric-type STAB moves. It also hits Tera Dragon users like Sandaconda and Regirock, walls that would otherwise switch into Jolteon without too much trouble. Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types like Uxie and Mesprit harder than any of its STAB moves do while also hitting Ghost-types like Palossand and Mismagius quite hard. While Jolteon's Tera type is flexible, Tera Blast Ice synergizes the best when striking back at its overall checks, hitting Ground-types like Sandaconda and Rhydon and Dragon-types like Alolan Exeggutor and Dipplin. However, this comes at the cost of using up the Terastallization slot. Tera Fairy and Tera Ghost, on the other hand, strengthen Alluring Voice and Shadow Ball, respectively, and make Jolteon slightly better at taking Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Passimian and Virizion. Volt Absorb allows Jolteon to switch in against predicted Electric-type attacks from Pokemon like Rotom and opposing Jolteon. Jolteon's blistering Speed makes it a prime candidate for VoltTurn teams, pairing well with pivots like Mesprit, Passimian, and Hisuian Decidueye. In addition to pivoting, they all can provide utility with Knock Off. Knock Off support works especially well with Jolteon, as its Volt Switch is able to put more pressure on Pokemon reliant on items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots for longevity, such as walls like Snorlax and Hisuian Decidueye. Wallbreakers like Bruxish and Glastrier benefit from Jolteon's Volt Switch and can capitalize on its checks. Grass- and Water-types like Shaymin, Virizion, Qwilfish, and Poliwrath can switch in and force out the Ground-types Jolteon struggles against and delay its need to Terastallize. Similarly, checks to Grass-types like Qwilfish formes and Articuno can similarly benefit Jolteon either through entry hazard and status support or through pivoting, respectively, allowing it to Terastallize as a later time. Hisuian Electrode stands out as Jolteon's worst matchup, possessing a quadruple resistance to Jolteon's STAB moves, higher Speed, and an immunity to Alluring Voice; checks to Hisuian Electrode like Hisuian Decidueye and Alolan Exegutor can blank its Volt Switch and threaten the opposition with their powerful STAB moves. Deterrents to Snorlax like Regirock and Toxicroak are valuable for pressuring it to Terastalize sooner, which can be exploited by teammates like Qwilfish formes and Hisuian Sneasel. Choice Specs boosts Jolteon's decent power to more threatening levels while still leveraging its excellent Speed. Volt Switch allows Jolteon to escape from walls like Snorlax and Regirock and maintain momentum for its team. Alluring Voice and Shadow Ball are Jolteon's strongest options for coverage against Ground-type foes; the former strikes at Fighting- and Dragon-types like Virizion and Alolan Exeggutor, while the latter pressures Ghost-types like Palossand and Rotom. Despite Jolteon's frailty, Volt Absorb gives it limited defensive utility by making it a situational switch-in against Electric-types like Rotom, opposing Jolteon, and Hisuian Electrode. While Choice Specs's enhanced power makes Jolteon more threatening as a pivot, it still struggles to tackle Ground- and Grass-types. Water- and Grass-types like Bruxish, Clawitzer, Virizion, and Hisuian Decidueye are great candidates to threaten these walls. Jolteon can form VoltTurn cores with fellow pivots like Passimian, Qwilfish formes, and Grafaiai, keeping momentum while threatening Jolteon's checks like Snorlax and Alolan Exeggutor. Water-types like Bruxish and Clawitzer pair excellently with Jolteon, threatening out Ground-types like Rhydon and Palossand that intend to block Jolteon's Volt Switch while maintaining a VoltTurn core. Similarly, checks to Grass-types like Charizard and Hisuian Sneasel can take advantage of Jolteon's Volt Switch and threaten heavy damage. On Choice Specs sets, Tera Blast Water can be used as a coverage move to drench Ground-types like Sandaconda and Sandslash. Tera Blast Ice and Tera Blast Fire both threaten Jolteon's Grass-type checks, with the former even targeting Ground-types. However, slotting Tera Blast makes Jolteon more reliant on team support to weaken its checks, and Terastalizing Jolteon into an Ice- or Fire-type requires entry hazard removal. Jolteon still gets walled by Grass-types if running Tera Blast Water. Tera Blast Flying allows Jolteon to beat Hisuian Electrode and gives it an immunity to Ground-type moves, though it once again demands hazard removal. Special Walls: Specially defensive Pokemon like Snorlax and Regirock are not particularly bothered by even Choice Specs Jolteon, as they have the bulk to weather repeated hits and can threaten huge damage on it back with their respective STAB moves. Ground-types: Specially bulky Ground-types like Toedscool and Rhydon are Jolteon's biggest obstacles, preventing it from pivoting and threatening to OHKO it with their STAB moves. They can proceed to set up Stealth Rock against it, with the latter even using it setup fodder. However, Ground-types that have mediocre special bulk like Sandaconda, Sandslash, and Palossand, must be wary of Jolteon's Choice Specs-boosted coverage. Grass-types: Shaymin's excellent natural bulk and Hisuian Electrode's resistances to Jolteon's entire moveset bar Shadow Ball make them the two most reliable Grass-type switch-ins, with both able to threaten it back with their own STAB moves. Other Grass-types like Hisuian Decidueye, Alolan Exeggutor, and Virizion are similarly effective but must watch out for coverage options. Revenge Killers: Despite being the second fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, Jolteon has mediocre longevity and can get picked off easily by faster Choice Scarf users like Bruxish, Passimian, and Mesprit without too much trouble; the aformentioned Hisuian Electrode can even pick off Jolteon without using a Choice Scarf. All of these Pokemon can also pivot on it in return, causing Jolteon's teammates to lose momentum. Slower cleaners or wallbreakers with priority moves like Sneasel and offensive Hisuian Decidueye can exploit Jolteon's low physical bulk without too much prior damage."

  "Jumbao": {
    "name": "Jumbao",
    "text": "This analysis was uploaded prior to The Indigo Disk release and may contain outdated information. Jumbao is one of the best Pokemon in the metagame thanks to its excellent offensive stats, defensive utility, and incredible ability in Drought, which enables a host of powerful offensive partners. Tera Blast Fire pressures the Steel- and Poison-types that resist Jumbao's STAB combination, such as Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Venomicon. Alternatively, if Jumbao is paired with teammates that rely on Terastallizing, Focus Blast can be used to retain the OHKO on Kingambit. Synthesis lets Jumbao continuously keep sun up with Heat Rock and outlast Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Roaring Moon. Tera Fire allows Jumbao to take advantage of Tera Blast Fire's coverage and improves its matchup against Steel-types such as Scizor and Gholdengo by removing its Steel weakness. Jumbao can fit comfortably on a variety of playstyles from bulky offense to balance thanks to the team support it provides through Drought. Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Cinderace, Ceruledge, and Iron Moth and Protosynthesis users such as Roaring Moon, Sandy Shocks, and Great Tusk are Jumbao's best offensive partners, as they all become extremely dangerous under sun. Since Jumbao is incredibly vulnerable to opposing Fire-types, defensive Pokemon that can handle them, such as Toxapex, Arghonaut, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, are excellent partners. The latter three can also set entry hazards to help Jumbao wallbreak, while Toxapex can handle opposing Jumbao and Glimmora. Toxapex and Hatterene can create momentum for sun teams with Eject Button, the latter of which also keeps entry hazards off the field for Fire-type teammates. Bulky Steel-types such as Corviknight and Equilibra can check Poison-types that Jumbao struggles to break such as Amoonguss and Venomicon and appreciate Jumbao handling their checks, such as Krilowatt and Great Tusk. Choice Scarf Jumbao picks off normally faster threats such as Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Krilowatt and supports offensive teammates with Healing Wish. Drought allows Jumbao to use Solar Beam quicker and provide sun support for teammates such as Great Tusk and Cinderace. Trace, on the other hand, allows Jumbao to copy valuable abilities such as Toxapex's Regenerator and Venomicon-E's Tinted Lens; however, it requires Jumbao to run Leaf Storm to retain a powerful Grass-type STAB move because of Solar Beam's two-turn wait outside of sun. Tera Fire with Tera Blast grants Jumbao coverage to hit Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo and resistances to key attacks such as Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Iron Valiant's Moonblast, and Baxcalibur's Ice Shard. Focus Blast, on the other hand, lets Jumbao OHKO Kingambit without Terastallizing. Choice Scarf Jumbao is a strong asset to bulky offense teams, providing them with speed control and incredibly useful Healing Wish support. Defensive pivots that lack reliable recovery, such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Equilibra, and Rotom-W, benefit immensely from Jumbao's ability to bring them back to full health late in the game, which gives them the freedom to take more hits early on. These Pokemon can also handle the Steel- and Fire-types that can take Jumbao's STAB attacks, such as Cinderace, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Pivots like Rotom-W, Corviknight, and Cinderace can bring Jumbao in safely against Pokemon it threatens, such as Krilowatt and Hydreigon. Bulky setup sweepers such as Hatterene and Kingambit can break down teams for Jumbao to clean late-game and greatly appreciate Jumbao giving them a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish. Poison-types such as Toxapex, Venomicon, and Clodsire wall Jumbao, so wallbreakers that can threaten them, such as Dragapult, Baxcalibur, and Smokomodo, are good teammates. Lastly, if Jumbao opts to use Drought, it can set sun to support Fire-types such as Skeledirge and Iron Moth and Protosynthesis users such as Great Tusk and Roaring Moon. Fire-types: Jumbao has nothing in its arsenal to meaningfully damage Fire-types such as Skeledirge, Volcarona, Iron Moth, and Ceruledge, all of which can take advantage of it by setting up or firing off a powerful attack. While Cinderace has to be more wary of repeated hits, it can switch into Jumbao at least once with relative impunity and force it out. Poison-types: Amoonguss switches into Jumbao relatively well and can use Spore as it is forced out but must watch out for Tera Blast Fire. Toxapex, Clodsire, and Venomicon can wall Jumbao and use it as an opportunity to set entry hazards or force progress with Toxic or Knock Off. Venomicon-E outspeeds Jumbao and can take at least one hit and OHKO back with Gunk Shot or Brave Bird. Steel-types: Steel-types such as Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Bulletproof Equilibra can wall and KO Jumbao with their STAB attacks, but they take significant damage from Tera Blast Fire if Jumbao Terastallizes. Faster Pokemon: If Jumbao does not hold a Choice Scarf, it is vulnerable to faster attackers with super effective coverage such as Greninja, Dragapult, and Stratagem."

  "Kingambit": {
    "name": "Kingambit",
    "text": "Kingambit is the premier offensive Pokemon in OU, with potent wallbreaking and sweeping potential thanks to its high Attack bolstered by Supreme Overlord and Swords Dance. It has excellent natural bulk and the ability to Terastallize to either maximize damage output or gain defensive advantages against its checks. Its strong Sucker Punch makes it one of the best anti-offense tools in the metagame. Kingambit can use Kowtow Cleave for a more consistent Dark-type attack than Sucker Punch. Iron Head gives coverage against Dark-resistant Pokemon, notably Clefable, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. Low Kick can be used over Kowtow Cleave or Iron Head to beat opposing Kingambit, although dropping Iron Head for Low Kick leaves Kingambit walled by Fairy-types, while dropping Kowtow Cleave leaves Kingambit walled by Skeledirge and Toxapex and stuck with the less reliable Sucker Punch as its only Dark-type move. Kingambit's item slot is very flexible depending on the needs of the team; Black Glasses is the best item on Kingambit to stack with Supreme Overlord and potentially Tera Dark; Air Balloon can be used to gain setup opportunities on Ground-types like Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Landorus-T; Lum Berry is an option to absorb otherwise crippling status from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult, and Cinderace; and Heavy-Duty Boots is an option on teams with either no or unreliable entry hazard control to keep Kingambit from being worn down by Spikes early-game. Tera Dark powers up Sucker Punch and Kowtow Cleave while removing Kingambit's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-type moves. In combination with Black Glasses and +2 Attack, it allows Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave to OHKO physical walls such as Alomomola, Gliscor, and Garganacl. Additionally, Kowtow Cleave 2HKOes Dondozo, while +2 Sucker Punch OHKOes Roaring Moon, opposing offensive Kingambit after Spikes, and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Ghost completely nullifies its severe Fighting weakness, most notably letting it overwhelm a otherwise decent checks in IronPress Skarmory and Zamazenta one-on-one. Aside from granting a Fire resistance, Tera Fire most importantly prevents Kingambit from being crippled by Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Moltres, Heatran, Dragapult, and Cinderace, especially for non-Lum Berry variants. Tera Flying can be used for its Ground immunity while still letting Kingambit shrug off Fighting-type moves, which helps against checks like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Zamazenta. Alternatively, Tera Fighting can be used with Low Kick to always OHKO defensive Great Tusk at +2 with five Supreme Overlord boosts and a layer of Spikes, and it can 3HKO Dondozo with five Supreme Overlord boosts. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize the power of Sucker Punch to break through bulky Pokemon. Jolly can be run over Adamant to win the Low Kick Kingambit mirror matchup against Adamant variants and outspeed some variants of IronPress Skarmory and Corviknight before they can boost Defense. However, the power drop from losing out on Adamant limits Kingambit in all other matchups, especially when Sucker Punch nullifies Adamant's speed drop anyway; Jolly Kingambit cannot OHKO Dragapult with Sucker Punch unboosted, and even with five Supreme Overlord boosts, it cannot 3HKO Dondozo without Black Glasses or Tera Dark. Kingambit fits on offensive and bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive profile and capabilities as a revenge killer and late-game sweeper, being able to defensively check non-Focus Blast Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Weavile without Low Kick. Offensively, Kingambit can revenge kill a wide range of Pokemon, including Deoxys-S and Dragapult while also being able to revenge kill anything without Substitute, Encore, or strong neutral priority, given enough chip damage. Roaring Moon is an excellent partner for Kingambit, overloading Dark-resistant foes and physical walls for each other and paving the way for one of them to break through and end the game. On bulky offense teams, Spikes setters like Skarmory and Gliscor synergize well with Kingambit. Spikes Gliscor in particular provides a highly valuable and resilient Ground immunity and Fighting resistance, and its Toxic also synergizes with Sucker Punch, helping to ease prediction by putting opposing Pokemon on a turn limit. On offensive teams, hazard setters such as Glimmora, Deoxys-S, and Hisuian Samurott help Kingambit break through foes that resist its moves, especially Great Tusk variants without Heavy-Duty Boots, which can be forced to take hazard chip early on. Kingambit can also be used alongside dual screens Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales, making it easier to set up and providing a highly valuable Dragapult check to the dual screens team. Rillaboom can support Kingambit with Grassy Surge, giving it easier setup opportunities with extra HP and weakening Earthquake from Gliscor, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu. Rillaboom can also switch into Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Dondozo and remove Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Corviknight with Knock Off. Galarian Slowking appreciates Kingambit resisting Ghost- and Dark-type attacks aimed at it. In return, it supports Kingambit with Future Sight to break through Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dondozo, Alomomola, and Skarmory while also switching into Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Zamazenta for Kingambit. Gholdengo is a great teammate for Kingambit, being able to handle threats like Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Skarmory, Corviknight, Substitute Iron Boulder, and Dondozo while checking Rillaboom and Dragonite, which can punish its Sucker Punch with priority. It also softens opposing teams for Kingambit to finish off using Gholdengo's own wallbreaking capabilities and excellence in keeping entry hazards on the field. By investing in bulk, Kingambit gains more setup opportunities and the ability to act as a short-term blanket check for much of the metagame; it also is an effective late-game cleaner. Kingambit can be used to absorb hits throughout the game from Pokemon like Dragapult, as well as Gholdengo and Weavile if they aren't running Fighting-type coverage. Iron Head destroys many of the Fairy-types in the tier, including Enamorus, Clefable, and Hatterene. Tera Blast Fairy is a surprising pick that can take on bulky Fighting-types, including Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Low Kick provides solid coverage for opposing Kingambit as well as maintaining a strong option into Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu. However, without Iron Head, Kingambit struggles with the matchup against Fairy-types. Kingambit makes good use of both Leftovers to increase its longevity late-game and Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage and continue switching in to keep pressure on. Tera Flying gives Kingambit a resistance to Fighting and an immunity to Ground, allowing it to set up on Great Tusk and Landorus-T, whereas Tera Fairy not only assists Kingambit defensively by giving it a Fighting resistance and a good defensive spread but also gives it access to Tera Blast Fairy to add to its coverage. 44 Speed EVs make Kingambit faster than Blissey, and the remaining 212 EVs not invested in Attack are put into HP, increasing its bulk. Alternatively, Kingambit's HP EVs can be raised to increase bulk, dropping Speed down to 4 EVs, which outruns uninvested Iron Hands, Ursaluna, and Azumarill. Bulky Kingambit is excellent on offense and balance teams as both a powerful late game setup sweeper and a form of speed control. Alongside more passive bulky Pokemon, such as Gliscor and Skarmory, Kingambit helps the team make more progress and break through tougher threats; in return, they can chip down Great Tusk with Toxic or Rocky Helmet damage. These Pokemon also set up entry hazards, which assist with wallbreaking. Slower teams appreciate the priority Kingambit provides, and Pokemon like Gholdengo also appreciate Kingambit's ability to switch into Dragon- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo. Great Tusk can weaken Gliscor, Landorus-T, and opposing Great Tusk for Kingambit while also being able to remove Skarmory's Rocky Helmet with Knock Off. In return, Great Tusk appreciates bulky Kingambit being able to switch in on Pokemon like Hatterene and Clefable that force Great Tusk out. Kingambit benefits from teammates with the ability to pivot and get it in safely, such as Meowscarada and Galarian Slowking. Galarian Slowking also supports Kingambit by setting up Future Sight, which is difficult for foes to switch in on at the same time as Kowtow Cleave, as it forces special and physical damage on the same turn; only Dark-types resist both, and they struggle to take Kingambit's coverage moves. Kingambit in turn helps Galarian Slowking by resisting Dark and Ghost and switching in on Gholdengo and Dragapult. Kingambit can form a Dark-type spam core with Roaring Moon or Weavile, as they can assist in beating down Dondozo, Skarmory, and Great Tusk. Rillaboom helps Kingambit by removing its Earthquake weakness and providing passive recovery from Grassy Terrain. Due to its lower special bulk, Kingambit can be vulnerable to wallbreakers like Raging Bolt and Walking Wake. Having teammates more suited to taking hits from such Pokemon, like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, is a good solution. Combining Kingambit's power with the power of Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo is another way to boost a team's wallbreaking potential. Gholdengo's ability allows it to keep hazards up, helping Kingambit keep pressure up. Both Pokemon defensively check Pokemon that threaten the other; Gholdengo checks Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, while Kingambit checks Ghost-types like Dragapult and other Gholdengo. Iron Valiant and Kingambit both have powerful speed control and support each other by weakening their shared checks, like Gliscor and Moltres. Kingambit is also useful against Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, which Iron Valiant forces in."

  "Klefki": {
    "name": "Klefki",
    "text": "Klefki is an incredibly crafty support Pokemon, making use of its incredible combination of ability, movepool, and typing to bring mayhem to the battlefield. Klefki's Prankster ability lets it scatter Spikes, spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, summon rain and sun, and even boost its own stats before the foe can act; it's a very malleable Pokemon that can find itself on almost any team due to its supportive capabilities. Klefki's highly coveted Steel / Fairy typing makes it a great sponge for special attacks, taking on the likes of Munkidori, Espeon, and Dragalge while also resisting Knock Off and U-turn. Although Klefki has many tricks up its sleeve, offense is not one of them, since it uses paltry base 80 offensive stats and often relies on Foul Play to not be a complete sitting duck. Any means to circumvent Prankster-affected moves such as Magic Bounce, Dark-types, and Taunt can generally spell doom for Klefki. Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Tera Dark Drednaw can take advantage of Klefki's inability to status them. Despite Klefki's phenomenal defensive typing, its stats often leave much to be desired, meaning some special wallbreakers like Porygon-Z and Indeedee-M can eventually overwhelm it even in spite of a type disadvantage. Foul Play enables Klefki to hit physical attackers for big damage it'd be unable to achieve using its own Attack stat, hitting Pokemon like Brambleghast and Gallade. Magnet Rise lets Klefki turn the tables on Ground-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Gligar with the former being weak to Dazzling Gleam. Maximum Special Defense investment lets Klefki deal with powerful special attackers in the tier like Munkidori and Dragalge. Tera Water lets Klefki take Fire-type attacks from Chandelure and Infernape in a pinch. Klefki's specially bulky nature makes it pair excellently with physical walls on balance teams, it is typically seen with Pokemon like Vaporeon and Swampert, as they can handle Fire-types like Infernape and Incineroar. Ghost-types like Chandelure and Brambleghast can block Rapid Spin to maintain Klefki's entry hazards, as do Defog deterrents like Galarian Articuno and Competitive Kilowattrel. Klefki's Prankster Thunder Wave is great speed control for slow, powerful wallbreakers like Choice Specs Chandelure and Toxtricity and Guts Heracross. Klefki can utilize its Prankster ability to run a Double Dance set; boosting its Defense with Iron Defense and special stats with Calm Mind while maintaining its health with Draining Kiss to turn Stored Power into an unwallable attack. Klefki can sport a Damp Rock or Heat Rock along with Rain Dance or Sunny Day, respectively, to facilitate those respective weather teams. Klefki can use Eject Button or Red Card in tandem with Prankster Recycle to repeatedly pivot itself or its foe out of play. Klefki can hold onto a Toxic Orb, which won't affect it, and use Switcheroo to bestow it onto an unsuspecting target like Oricorio-E, which can otherwise set up on Klefki safely. Ground-types: Ground-types like Swampert, Flygon, Gligar, and Swampert are immune to Klefki's Prankster Thunder Wave and threaten it with Earthquake, although they must be wary of Magnet Rise. Bulky Setup Sweepers: Bulky setup sweepers that can take advantage of Klefki's passivity can be a huge issue for it. Calm Mind Pokemon like Cresselia, Chandelure, and Florges take minimal damage from Klefki's attacks and can accrue multiple boosts while it flounders helplessly. Prankster-immune Pokemon: Many Pokemon that can ignore Klefki's Prankster-affected moves in one way or another can take advantage of Klefki's relative passivity. Magic Bounce Espeon, Dark-types, and Thunder Wave-immune Pokemon like Oricorio-E and Flygon find safe entry against Klefki and threaten it."

  "Koffing": {
    "name": "Koffing",
    "text": "Koffing establishes itself as an excellent physical tank in Little Cup due to its high base Defense stat and Poison typing, which let it check physical attackers like Mienfoo and Timburr. Koffing's best use comes from its ability Neutralizing Gas, which has useful applications, such as denying Mienfoo and Foongus recovery from Regenerator, preventing Snivy from gaining a Special Attack boost from Leaf Storm with Contrary, and denying Hisuian Growlithe the ability to avoid recoil from Head Smash and Flare Blitz. Thunderbolt gives Koffing an option to hit Vullaby and Mareanie for super effective damage. Will-O-Wisp can weaken physical attackers that may switch into Koffing such as Mudbray and Trapinch. Pain Split is Koffing's only good recovery option. Fire Blast can be used over Will-O-Wisp or Pain Split to hit Steel-types and Foongus super effectively. Koffing's EV spread allows it to leverage its already high Defense stat and boost its attacks, letting it 2HKO Pokemon like Foongus with Sludge Bomb if its Eviolite is removed. Koffing uses Tera Water, as it's a generally good defensive type, and it additionally lets Koffing take minimal damage from Shellder's Icicle Spear. Teammates that appreciate Koffing's presence include Mudbray, as Koffing can check Snivy, which can come in easily against Mudbray. Pawniard also makes use of Koffing's ability to deny Mienfoo's Regenerator, making it easier to remove it for Pawniard. Koffing struggles against Glimmet and Hisuian Growlithe, as neither are threatened by any of Koffing's attacks. Mudbray is a good teammate, as it can switch in to both Pokemon and scare them out with Earthquake. Additionally, Gothita can assist Koffing with Glimmet due to Shadow Tag, letting it trap Glimmet for Koffing."

  "Komala": {
    "name": "Komala",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: At first glance, Komala may appear to be just another irrelevant Normal-type left to rot in the lowest of the low tiers, but make no mistake, this sleepy little marsupial has not just fallen out of a coconut tree. With a surprising level of special bulk and Attack, a status immunity from its ability Comatose, and a movepool to make any high-tier jealous, Komala is a solid final pick. Its low Speed, poor physical bulk, and lack of any super effective STAB moves hold it back from being truly great, but within its point tier, Komala stands alone in its ability to fulfill a useful niche and not be a burden when it is brought to games. Utility Support: While Komala gets the most utility from Rapid Spin, it can be run offensively, taking advantage of its solid Attack stat and great coverage moves like Knock Off and Earthquake, or defensively, taking advantage of its decent Special Defense and utility options like Wish and Yawn. Rapid Spin can also be dropped to allow Komala to run an extra utility move and function as a decent defensive pivot. All variations of this role appreciate U-turn, allowing it to maintain momentum after clearing entry hazards or absorbing hits. Primary STAB Moves: Body Slam, Double-Edge Setup Moves: Bulk Up, Swords Dance Utility Moves: Rapid Spin, Knock Off, U-turn, Wish, Yawn, Super Fang, Substitute, Brick Break, Protect Coverage: Acrobatics, Earthquake, Gunk Shot, Ice Spinner, Iron Head, Low Kick, Play Rough, Rock Slide, Seed Bomb, Shadow Claw, Sucker Punch, Superpower, Wood Hammer, Zen Headbutt Low Sweep / Bulldoze / Rock Tomb: Speed-lowering moves allow Komala to catch incoming foes and prevent them from setting up or taking advantage of its relative passivity. Flail / Reversal / Endeavor: In conjunction with Endure + Custap Berry or Focus Sash, Flair, Reversal, and Endeavor can deal a high amount of damage to foes, KOing them or allowing them to be finished off with Sucker Punch or revenge killed by a teammate. Assault Vest: Komala doesn't need to use status moves to be effective, so it can run Assault Vest to boost its already decent Special Defense. Leftovers: Defensive and utility-oriented Komala sets can run Leftovers to improve survivability and stay on the field longer. Heavy-Duty Boots: While Komala is already immune to the effects of Toxic Spikes, Heavy-Duty Boots can be ran in matchups against prolific entry hazard setters to prevent it from taking significant damage on entry and let it more effectively clear entry hazards. Damage-boosting Items: Komala's surprisingly good Attack stat can be boosted even further with damage-boosting items like Choice Band and Life Orb to allow it to deal immediate damage. Focus Sash / Custap Berry: Focus Sash allows Komala to survive a hit and stop a foe from sweeping with Flail, Reversal, or Endeavor and Sucker Punch. Custap Berry functions similarly but uses Endure instead of Focus Sash. Komala should not be a Tera Captain, since it does not need to be one to do its job effectively. If it is made a Tera Captain anyways, Tera Dark can give a STAB boost to valuable coverage moves like Knock Off and Sucker Punch while still retaining a resistance to Ghost, and Tera Ghost and Fairy let it take the Fighting-type attacks that it's normally weak to and improve its survivability. It's important to note that due to how Comatose works, moves like Hex that deal double damage to statused foes will always hit Komala for double damage. Komala is a solid final-round pick for teams looking for a secondary method of entry hazard removal or a slow pivot. Its Ghost immunity is valuable, especially since higher-tier Normal-types are rare and sometimes hard to fit in drafts. Setup Sweepers: Setup sweepers such as Sneasler, Volcarona, and Garchomp appreciate Komala's ability to switch in on moves like Thunder Wave and Will-O-Wisp and keep entry hazards off the field for them. Defensive Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon that are susceptible to Toxic such as Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Chesnaught not only appreciate Komala switching in on Toxic but also bait in special attackers that Komala can more effectively deal with. Many of these Pokemon can also effectively switch in on attacks that Komala struggles to handle. Physical Fighting-types: Komala's lacking Defense means that strong physical Fighting-type moves from Pokemon like Urshifu-S, Blaziken, and Quaquaval can often OHKO it. Defensive Walls: Though they do not appreciate taking a Knock Off, defensive walls such as Skarmory, Garganacl, and Corviknight can take advantage of Komala's usual lack of setup moves and disruption outside of Yawn to set up with Iron Defense and KO it back with Body Press."

  "Koraidon": {
    "name": "Koraidon",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Koraidon is arguably the most impactful Pokemon in Ubers and is used on the majority of teams. Extremely high Speed and Attack boosted by Orichalcum Pulse and the high Base Power of its moves make Koraidon a nightmare to switch into. Scale Shot combined with Loaded Dice gives Koraidon the tools to break past would-be checks such as Ho-Oh without much trouble, leaving very few reliable checks to it; in fact, Koraidon's incredible breaking power makes dedicated checks such as Arceus-Fairy viable by its sheer presence alone. Despite Scale Shot Koraidon's attention-grabbing power, Koraidon's most used set is in fact Choice Scarf, which provides massive amounts of utility. It's able to revenge kill nearly the entire tier, clean up weakened teams with ease, provide momentum with U-turn, and serve as a pseudo-check to powerful wallbreakers like Extreme Killer Arceus, Kyogre, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Koraidon is somewhat held back by its reliance on moves like Flare Blitz, which has a lot of recoil, and Scale Shot, which can fail to achieve certain KOs should it miss or not get the right amount of hits. Furthermore, despite the lack of proper checks to Koraidon, it is often pivoted into by Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Flutter Mane, Kyogre, and Landorus-T, which can either absorb a Dragon-type move and KO back or cripple Koraidon through Drizzle or Intimidate. As such, Koraidon requires proper prediction to realize its full potential. Thanks to how heavy Ubers is as a whole, Low Kick is chosen for its high Base Power without any drawbacks. Close Combat has consistent power, which may come in handy against weakened or Terastallized Ho-Oh and Gliscor, although one must be careful of its Defense drops. Outrage, while sometimes risky, does perform some notable feats such as 2HKOing defensive Ho-Oh; Dragon Claw may be run instead, as it is risk-free. Flare Blitz has massive power when under the sun, and it becomes even more powerful when boosted by Tera Fire, OHKOing defensive Necrozma-DM 50% of the time. Tera Ghost is useful for the Normal and Fighting immunities that it provides, helping Koraidon take on Extreme Killer Arceus and opposing Koraidon. Choice Scarf Koraidon is an extremely common sight on nearly any team type outside of hyper offense. All of them appreciate Koraidon's ability to check Extreme Killer Arceus and provide sun to weaken Kyogre. As Koraidon tends to attract physically defensive switch-ins, it can use U-turn to bring in powerful special wallbreakers that may otherwise have a hard time switching in, such as Miraidon, Kyogre, Flutter Mane, and even Walking Wake and Chi-Yu. Koraidon must be wary of its HP, as it can easily be worn down through entry hazard damage, Flare Blitz recoil, and Rocky Helmet chip. Due to this, Koraidon works well with most mainstay defensive Pokemon in Ubers, like Necrozma-DM, Ting-Lu, Ho-Oh, Gliscor, Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water, as they let Koraidon save itself for when it's needed to revenge kill or clean weakened teams. Additional checks to Kyogre are especially appreciated, as Koraidon can easily be 2HKOed by Kyogre's Ice Beam; Miraidon, Eternatus, Clodsire, Calm Mind Arceus-Water, and Thunder Kyogre are good options for this. With its incredible power, speed, ease of setup, and lack of reliable checks, Scale Shot Koraidon is the most influential and dangerous sweeper in the entire metagame. In conjunction with Loaded Dice, Scale Shot is a powerful attack that allows Koraidon to threaten the many Dragon-types in Ubers, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, Eternatus, and Giratina-O. It is a bit luck-dependent, however, as it sometimes needs to hit a certain number of times to achieve certain KOs. For example, after a Swords Dance boost, Scale Shot must hit five times to OHKO defensive Ho-Oh. In addition to the staples of Scale Shot, Flare Blitz, and Swords Dance, this set has a lot of versatility when it comes to its last move and Tera type. Low Kick dispatches Extreme Killer Arceus trying to revenge kill it with Extreme Speed, as Koraidon is bulky enough to survive Extreme Speed after a Scale Shot. Opposing Koraidon, Miraidon, Zacian-C, Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM also fall to Low Kick after a Swords Dance, meaning Koraidon does not have to risk missing Scale Shot or taking recoil damage from Flare Blitz, especially against Zacian-C, which commonly tries to switch into Koraidon to absorb Scale Shot. Substitute scouts for any potential Terastallizations attempting to slow Koraidon down, most notably Tera Fairy on several Pokemon like Miraidon and defensive Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water. In conjunction with Tera Ghost, Substitute is also useful for turning Pokemon like Arceus-Water, Gliscor lacking Earthquake, and Skeledirge into setup fodder. Tera Ghost gives Koraidon an immunity to Low Kick from opposing Koraidon and, more importantly, Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus, letting it use these Pokemon as setup fodder, especially if running Substitute. Tera Fire, on the other hand, gives Koraidon a Fairy resistance, immunity to Will-O-Wisp and Sacred Fire burns from Ho-Oh, and STAB on Flare Blitz, letting it turn the tables on Zacian-C and Arceus-Fairy, which are good checks to unboosted Koraidon. Scale Shot Koraidon is best used on hyper offense teams that can easily overwhelm its checks, but it can also be used as a ferocious sweeper on bulky teams. It loves pairing with Miraidon, as Miraidon can pivot to Koraidon for it to set up on Miraidon's common checks in Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Double Dance Miraidon also pairs extremely well with Scale Shot Koraidon on hyper offense. Zacian-C is also a superb Koraidon partner, as the two can overwhelm their shared checks, such as Ho-Oh, Landorus-T, and defensive Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water. Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM can switch into Arceus-Fairy and lure and heavily damage Skeledirge with a boosted Photon Geyser, making it a solid partner. Entry hazard support in the form of leads like Deoxys-S and Glimmora and bulkier hazard stackers like Gliscor is greatly appreciated, as Arceus-Fairy, Koraidon's best check, takes enormous damage from a Swords Dance-boosted Flare Blitz and is cleanly OHKOed after Stealth Rock and a single layer of Spikes. Tera Steel is possible on Choice Scarf sets, as it helps against Extreme Killer Arceus while also providing a useful Dragon-type resistance for opposing Koraidon and Miraidon. Flame Charge may be run on Scale Shot sets. In particular, Flame Charge helps against Zacian-C and Flutter Mane that may try to switch in on Scale Shot, which eases prediction greatly. However, this comes at the cost of the sheer power of Flare Blitz, and this forces Koraidon to Terastallize more often to raise Flame Charge's Base Power. Taunt also has potential on Scale Shot sets, as it prevents moves like Ho-Oh's Whirlwind and Gliscor's Toxic, but Low Kick and Substitute generally have more utility. Choice Band gives Koraidon absurd breaking power from the get-go; however, Choice Band's move limitation greatly hinders Koraidon's sweeping ability, not to mention that Scale Shot Koraidon already packs enough power. Temper Flare is generally outclassed by Flare Blitz. Arceus-Fairy: Arceus-Fairy is the most common check to Koraidon, as it absorbs Scale Shot and Low Kick with ease and can tank unboosted Flare Blitz. Koraidon can use Tera Fire to take Judgment, and a +2 or Tera Fire Flare Blitz is severely threatening to Arceus-Fairy, but Arceus-Fairy can use Tera Water and paralyze Koraidon back, crippling it for the rest of the game. Fairy-types and Tera Fairy: Zacian-C and Flutter Mane can take anything but Flare Blitz and force Koraidon out with their super effective coverage and higher Speed. Fairy is also an extremely common Tera type and is prominent on many physical walls, as well as on some special walls like Eternatus and Ting-Lu. Skeledirge: Thanks to Unaware, Skeledirge can shrug off anything that Koraidon throws at it outside of Scale Shot. Koraidon needs at least a high damage roll four-hit Scale Shot followed by a five-hit Scale Shot to guarantee the 2HKO on Skeledirge, meaning that Skeledirge can wall Koraidon even when switching in on Scale Shot provided Koraidon doesn't get the required luck. Should Koraidon use any other move when Skeledirge switches in, Skeledirge will have no problem walling Koraidon. If Skeledirge is in danger of being KOed, it can always use Tera Fairy to stop Koraidon in its tracks. Kyogre: Kyogre dislikes switching in on any moves outside of Flare Blitz, but Kyogre's Drizzle negates Orichalcum Pulse and lowers Flare Blitz's power. This makes Kyogre a decent pivot into Koraidon, especially in combination with other checks. Physically Defensive Pokemon: Arceus-Water has high Defense and is one of the few Pokemon capable of taking two five-hit Scale Shots in a row. It also resists Flare Blitz and can burn or paralyze Koraidon. However, Arceus-Water cannot reliably check +2 Koraidon, especially if entry hazards are on the field, as a +2 Low Kick has an 81.3% chance to OHKO after one layer of Spikes damage. Landorus-T cannot wall Koraidon by itself, but it can be used as a useful pivot into it, lowering its Attack with Intimidate and providing chip damage with Rocky Helmet. Groudon has enough raw physical bulk to tank anything Koraidon can throw at it, but Groudon is limited by its lack of reliable recovery. Ho-Oh can phaze Koraidon with Whirlwind or smack it with Brave Bird, but it risks being KOed by Outrage or a boosted five-hit Scale Shot. Necrozma-DM does not like taking Flare Blitz at all, but it can be used in a pinch to check unboosted Koraidon or to make Koraidon use Flare Blitz more often and suffer recoil damage as a result. Gliscor can use Choice Scarf Koraidon as an easy opportunity to set entry hazards. Chip Damage: Koraidon is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards and status, in addition to commonly taking Flare Blitz recoil and Rocky Helmet damage. Due to this, Koraidon can be chipped over the course of a game quite quickly. Priority: Scale Shot drops Koraidon's Defense, making priority options a common way to revenge kill it. Extreme Speed from Arceus can easily take down a weakened Koraidon, although Arceus needs to watch out for Tera Ghost or Steel. Chien-Pao's Ice Shard is a good way to take out Koraidon that have not Fire-type Terastallized into the Fire typing. Sucker Punch from Chien-Pao and Kingambit may take out a Terastallized Koraidon."

    "text": "Krilowatt functions as a good pivot with its good stats, great offensive typing, and exceptional ability in Magic Guard, which allows it to pivot constantly without fear of getting chipped down by entry hazards. Its STAB combination is also amazing in conjunction with Ice Beam, threatening a large portion of the metagame for super effective damage. Ice Beam covers Grass- and Dragon-types such as Caribolt, Rillaboom, Dragapult, Chuggalong, and Miasmaw. Tera Water sheds Krilowatt's weakness to Ground, allowing it to switch into Pokemon like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu without getting OHKOed. Tera Flying flips its Ground and Grass matchups completely, which can catch Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Caribolt, and Rillaboom off guard. Krilowatt shines best on balance and bulky offense teams that can capitalize on it forcing out foes with its decent offensive presence and bringing in teammates safely using Volt Switch. Krilowatt should always be paired with a Knock Off absorber like Clefable or Gliscor, as most of its offensive presence is due to Life Orb, and both Clefable and Gliscor can provide entry hazards to chip down foes further. Gliscor specifically pairs well with Krilowatt, as it can help wear down Krilowatt's checks with Toxic. Pokemon that can set up Spikes, like the aforementioned Gliscor, Arghonaut, and Skarmory, are amazing teammates for Krilowatt, as its offensive coverage forces a lot of switching. Krilowatt pairs well with sweepers like Hemogoblin and Nasty Plot Gholdengo, as they take advantage of the free switch in and chip damage that Krilowatt provides with Volt Switch, allowing them to break through their checks. Krilowatt is weak to Grass- and Ground-type attacks from foes like Meowscarada, Ogerpon-W, and Equilibra, so pairing it with Pokemon who can take on these threats such as Kyurem, Ogerpon-W, and Venomicon can really help keep Krilowatt healthy. Dragapult can deal huge damage to special walls like Galarian Slowking and Malaconda and can form a good VoltTurn core with Krilowatt. Krilowatt is a useful option on rain teams, as it can form a VoltTurn core with Pelipper, bringing in rain sweepers like Barraskewda and Raging Bolt in to deal massive damage to foes, as well as benefitting from rain boosting its own Surf. Knock Off: Since most of Krilowatt's offensive pressure is because of Life Orb, Pokemon that can remove it greatly cripple Krilowatt's offensive output. Pokemon such as Weavile and Roaring Moon outspeed Krilowatt and can remove its Life Orb with Knock Off while dealing tons of damage. Water-immune Pokemon: Ogerpon-W can absorb Krilowatt's Surf, not only healing itself but also threatening an OHKO with Power Whip. Mollux and Clodsire can also absorb Surf, allowing them to either threaten heavy damage or set up Stealth Rock. Offensive Grass-types: Pokemon like Meowscarada and Caribolt can outspeed Krilowatt and threaten to KO it using their strong Grass-type while taking Surf and Thunderbolt rather easily. However, they don't like taking an Ice Beam on the switch in. Rillaboom and Malaconda also give Krilowatt trouble, as they can take an Ice Beam, then either OHKO with Grassy Glide or cripple it with Knock Off, respectively. Special Walls: Galarian Slowking can easily take Krilowatt's attacks and can deal decent damage with Sludge Bomb, set up Future Sight, or pivot out with Chilly Reception. Equilibra and Ting-Lu can also be a problem because they are immune to Volt Switch and can respond with Earth Power and Earthquake, respectively, but they don't like switching into a Surf. Defensive Terastallization: Krilowatt relies heavily on threatening super effective damage, so Terastallization that can remove foes' weaknesses, like Tera Dragon Cresceidon and Tera Grass Heatran, can suddenly catch Krilowatt off guard, making these foes harder to deal with."

  "Krookodile": {
    "name": "Krookodile",
    "text": "Krookodile is a fantastic progress maker in RU due to having access to Knock Off and important utility moves like Stealth Rock and Taunt while being incredibly threatening offensively thanks to its high Attack and the perfect coverage provided by its STAB moves and Gunk Shot. Although Krookodile is most often seen taking advantage of Intimidate and its decent defensive typing to act as an entry hazard setter and physical sponge, its Choice item sets can easily run away with games if not handled carefully thanks to its spammable STAB attacks, especially when assisted by Moxie. However, Krookodile suffers from a lack of recovery options, which hinders its longevity and ability to keep hazards up throughout the game. Its overreliance on immunities and resistances to switch in on wallbreakers like Thundurus and Mimikyu further holds it back defensively. Lastly, Krookodile's mediocre Speed tier renders it vulnerable to faster threats such as Mienshao and Galarian Zapdos, which is intensified by its weakness to U-turn. Choice Band Krookodile is a ferocious wallbreaker with its nearly unresisted STAB combination of Earthquake and Knock Off. It is difficult to consistently weather Krookodile's attacks due to its resistance to Stealth Rock and serviceable natural bulk combined with Intimidate giving it many opportunities to hit the field against Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Necrozma, and Reuniclus. Gunk Shot gives Krookodile great coverage, hitting common checks to it like Chesnaught, Slither Wing, and Galarian Weezing for decent damage. Close Combat gives Krookodile the ability to annihilate Dark-types like Umbreon and opposing Krookodile. Crunch can be used to consistently hit Pokemon such as Slowbro and Salamence once their item has been removed. Tera Dark allows for freakishly powerful Dark-type STAB moves, allowing it to OHKO Slowbro with a boosted Knock Off or Crunch after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Amoonguss with Knock Off. It also gives Krookodile the ability to shed its Ground typing, removing its Water- and Grass-type weaknesses and improving matchups into Pokemon such as Amoonguss and Choice Scarf Basculegion-F. Alternatively, Tera Poison can be used to flip its Bug- and Fighting-type weaknesses, giving it better matchups into Pokemon such as Slither Wing and Terrakion. It also strengthens Gunk Shot, allowing Krookodile to completely crush its common checks like Chesnaught and Slither Wing while also dealing very good damage to Galarian Weezing. Krookodile thrives on bulky offense and balance teams where it acts as a wallbreaker that provides defensive utility due to its Electric and Psychic immunities. Krookodile fits well with pivots that allow it to freely switch in without taking any sort of damage such as Magnezone, Noivern, and Fezandipiti, since it lacks recovery. Fezandipiti is a particularly good teammate, as it can lure in and pivot out of Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon like Bisharp, Jirachi, Hisuian Goodra, and Gengar, allowing Krookodile to come in and threaten them with its strong Knock Off and Earthquake. Slowbro pairs well with Krookodile, as it resists the Fighting- and Water-type attacks from Pokemon like Mienshao and Barraskewda aimed at Krookodile, while Krookodile resists the Electric- and Ghost-type attacks from Thundurus and Gengar aimed at Slowbro. Slowbro also spreads paralysis with Thunder Wave, which Krookodile greatly appreciates, as it is slower than most of the unboosted metagame. Future Sight support from Slowbro and Reuniclus can threaten the Poison- and Fighting-types such as Slither Wing, Galarian Weezing, and Chesnaught that switch into Krookodile. Krookodile enjoys entry hazard control from the likes of Cyclizar, Noivern, and Galarian Weezing due to its vulnerability to Spikes. The former two are also pivots that invite in Steel-types for Krookodile, while Galarian Weezing is a great defensive presence capable of switching into a plethora of strong attackers such as Slither Wing, opposing Krookodile, and Mienshao. Balance teams that slowly whittle down the opposition, especially with Spikes support from the likes of Chesnaught and Quagsire, enjoy Krookodile's unique defensive profile as well as strong STAB Knock Off to remove the ever-present Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Bulky offense teams with multiple switch moves like Volt Switch and U-turn from Pokemon like Thundurus, Fezandipiti, and Jirachi provide Krookodile with many entry points, capitalizing on its offensive and defensive utility to maintain hazards and wear down teams. Krookodile solidifies its place in the metagame as the premier offensive Ground-type, with access to Stealth Rock and Intimidate giving it great utility for an offensive Pokemon. Krookodile has advantages over other Ground-type entry hazard setters like Flygon and Hippowdon because of its combination of good Speed and access to Knock Off, which helps accumulate hazard chip by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from checks such as Salamence and Slowbro. Taunt helps Krookodile disrupt slower Pokemon trying to setup on it like Air Balloon Revavroom and Gyarados while also being used to prevent other Pokemon like Hippowdon and Galarian Weezing from setting up hazards and using status moves. Gunk Shot helps against switch-ins that would otherwise resist its STAB moves, hitting Chesnaught for super effective damage and Levitate Galarian Weezing for neutral. Leftovers is preferred on Krookodile to passively recover on Pokemon it forces out, giving it more longevity and offsetting Stealth Rock damage. Tera Poison flips the weaknesses to Bug, Fairy, and Fighting into valuable resistances while giving Gunk Shot a STAB boost. Resisting Bug- and Fighting-type attacks is great for Krookodile, allowing it to resist First Impression from Slither Wing and take on Fighting-type Pokemon faster than it such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao. Tera Ghost similarly flips the weaknesses to Bug and Fighting, and allows Krookodile to block Rapid Spin from the tier’s most common hazard removal, Cyclizar. Stealth Rock Krookodile fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate having a more offensive entry hazard setter that is able to force progress with Knock Off, stack hazard chip damage on Heavy-Duty Boots users, and threaten common hazard removal options like Cyclizar, Galarian Weezing, and Noivern. Krookodile appreciates teammates that can switch into super effective attacks from Pokemon trying to revenge kill it like Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Galarian Zapdos, Mienshao, and Slither Wing, and defensive switch-ins that threaten it like Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Galarian Weezing. Steel-types such as Empoleon and Jirachi make for good teammates, resisting Fairy-type attacks from Gardevoir and Fezandipiti that would otherwise threaten Krookodile. Empoleon also covers its Water-type weakness, and Jirachi appreciates having a teammate that can take Dark-type moves for it. Jirachi relies on Covert Cloak users like Slowbro and Fezandipiti getting their item removed to capitalize on its paralysis and flinch chances with Body Slam and Iron Head, respectively. Galarian Weezing is a great teammate for Krookodile, being able to take on Bug- and Fighting-type attacks from Slither Wing, Terrakion, and Mienshao, while threatening back with Strange Steam and Will-O-Wisp, while Krookodile can take on Psychic-type attacks from Reuniclus and Necrozma that threaten Galarian Weezing. Offensive teammates such as Volcanion and Thundurus benefit from Krookodile removing Assault Vest from their most common switch-in, Cyclizar. Volcanion appreciates Krookodile removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Noivern and Salamence, limiting their ability to switch into it. Choice Scarf Krookodile can fill many roles in a match; it can revenge kill weakened foes, force progress against bulky teams with Knock Off, switch into attacks that it resists to threaten slower foes with a KO, and clean up teams weakened by its teammates. Gunk Shot threatens Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Chesnaught and can poison Slowbro, which is otherwise able to check Krookodile once its item is removed. Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Noivern and Salamence hard and has a chance to OHKO Thundurus. Close Combat can OHKO Cyclizar and provides strong coverage for opposing Krookodile, Wo-Chien, and Crawdaunt. Stealth Rock allows Krookodile to be an entry hazard setter, letting more offensive teams forgo a more defensive hazard setter like Hippowdon or Empoleon. Choice Scarf makes Krookodile outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and other common Choice Scarf users like Basculegion-F and Gardevoir. Intimidate lets Krookodile take hits from physical attackers like Jirachi and Salamence to force them out or revenge kill them. Moxie lets Krookodile be a late-game cleaner and sweeper that makes sacrificing Pokemon to bring others in much riskier for the opponent. Tera Poison lets Krookodile resist normally super effective attacks such as Grass Knot from Thundurus, Moonblast from Fezandipiti, and Close Combat from Mienshao, allowing it to score KOs it may otherwise not have and begin its sweep with Moxie boosts. Tera Poison also empowers Gunk Shot, turning it into Krookodile's strongest STAB attack. Tera Dark is an alternative that boosts Knock Off, letting it OHKO Jirachi and Reuniclus after a bit of chip damage. It also removes Krookodile's weakness to Aqua Jet from Crawdaunt and Feraligatr. Choice Scarf Krookodile fits on more offensive teams that are looking for a sweeper that doesn't need to take time to set up or a revenge killer that can safely switch into or force out physical wallbreakers. Krookodile can switch into predicted Electric- and Psychic-type attacks from Thundurus, Raikou, and Reuniclus and force them out, but it needs to be careful when doing so, as these Pokemon usually carry coverage moves that threaten Krookodile. Spikes stacking teams can benefit immensely from Krookodile due to its ability to get rid of Heavy-Duty Boots with STAB Knock Off and sweep a weakened opposing team with Moxie boosts. Chesnaught can take the Grass- and Water-type attacks that threaten Krookodile while also taking Knock Off handily and setting Spikes. Poison-types like Fezandipiti and Amoonguss can swap into the Fighting-, Fairy-, and Grass-type attacks that Krookodile would rather avoid while also baiting out Psychic-type attacks for Krookodile to freely switch into. Steel-types additionally can easily take the Grass- and Fairy-type attacks that threaten Krookodile, making Jirachi and Magnezone excellent partners. Krookodile is a great partner for Cyclizar, as it is able to threaten Ghost-types that come in and spinblock Cyclizar. It also synergizes with other entry hazard removers like Galarian Weezing, which has an immunity to Ground and a 4x resistance to both Fighting- and Bug-type attacks that threaten Krookodile, and Noivern, which can take Fighting-, Water-, and Grass-type attacks aimed at Krookodile while also removing hazards for it. Bulky wallbreakers like Entei and Guts Conkeldurr can threaten defensive checks to Krookodile like Slowbro and Galarian Weezing, making progress against Pokemon that it struggles with. Defensive checks to Krookodile like Hippowdon and Galarian Weezing can also be threatened by strong special attackers like Armarouge and Basculegion-F. Thundurus can threaten Slowbro and ignores Earthquake from Hippowdon while being a strong pivot with Volt Switch. Scale Shot + Bulk Up or Moxie can be used alongside Loaded Dice to transform Krookodile into a deceptively strong setup sweeper, but it is often difficult to pull off due to it being very situational. Roar and Dragon Tail are decent options for phazing out setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Flygon that could otherwise take advantage of Krookodile. Aerial Ace can be used as niche coverage for eliminating Slither Wing specifically. Physical Tanks: The common physically defensive Pokemon in RU, particularly Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Chesnaught, can often wall Krookodile and keep it from making progress. While Krookodile can hit the last two with Knock Off and Gunk Shot, it is still fearful of their retaliation through Scald and Body Press, respectively. Galarian Weezing: Levitate Galarian Weezing sets itself apart from other defensive tanks as an answer to Krookodile by being a near-perfect counter. It is able to cripple Krookodile with Will-O-Wisp and deal massive damage to it through Strange Steam, while Krookodile is forced to run the unreliable Gunk Shot to deal any damage to Galarian Weezing. Moreover, Galarian Weezing has access to Defog, which allows it to comfortably remove Stealth Rock previously set up by the opposing Krookodile. Fighting-types: Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Slither Wing, Mienshao, and Galarian Zapdos either take little damage from or outspeed Krookodile, which allows them to blow holes through Krookodile's team or safely use U-turn into another Pokemon after forcing it out. Wallbreakers: Despite Intimidate, Krookodile's subpar bulk often prevents it from switching into strong physical attacks such as Maushold's Population Bomb and Entei's Sacred Fire. It is also quite vulnerable to coverage from special wallbreakers such as Moonblast Gardevoir, Grass Knot Thundurus, and Focus Blast Gengar, which serve as deterrent for its entry; otherwise, Krookodile would want to switch in on one or both of their STAB moves because of its immunity or resistance to them. Therefore, Krookodile's defensive utility is often heavily prediction-reliant and can be exploited by offensive structures."

  "Kyogre": {
    "name": "Kyogre",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Despite Miraidon taking the spotlight of Ubers's top special wallbreaker, Kyogre is still one of the most threatening Pokemon in the tier, as it often breaks better than Miraidon thanks to teams preparing for it less. Kyogre also sports a surprising amount of defensive utility, as its Drizzle is very useful against Koraidon, and it has enough bulk to take on even physical threats such as Arceus-Ground and Calyrex-I. Kyogre is somewhat limited by its average Speed stat, lack of recovery making it worn down by repeated hits, and by how common Koraidon and Miraidon are, but outside of these flaws, Kyogre should be considered for nearly any bulky offense or balance team. Origin Pulse's higher power allows for some notable KOs, like OHKOing Ho-Oh outright and having a high chance to OHKO Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM after a layer of Spikes damage. Surf may be chosen for its perfect accuracy. Ice Beam nails Koraidon and Miraidon on the switch in and is Kyogre's best tool to pressure Eternatus and Clodsire. Thunder lets Kyogre break through Arceus-Water and opposing Kyogre, and its 30% paralysis chance is quite useful. Alternatively, Thunder Wave can be used to more directly cripple Eternatus on the switch in. Tera Fairy is usually chosen for its use against Koraidon, allowing Kyogre to take Scale Shot or Low Kick and retaliate back. Tera Poison has use for blocking Toxic from Eternatus, and it can let Kyogre absorb Toxic Spikes for teams that lack a Poison-type or Defog. Since Kyogre does not need the power of a boosting item, Heavy-Duty Boots is the best option, as it lets Kyogre pressure the opposing team without having to worry about entry hazard damage. It's also critical for the hyper offense matchup, as it allows Kyogre to survive +1 Arceus-Ground's Earthquake and +1 Necrozma-DM's Photon Geyser even with entry hazards up. The given EVs allow Kyogre to outspeed paralyzed Zacian-C and Deoxys-A, while the HP and Defense allow Kyogre to survive four hits from Koraidon's Scale Shot at +2, with the rest dumped into Special Attack. A more bulky spread of 248 HP / 164 Def / 80 SpA / 16 Spe with a Bold nature allows Kyogre to take one +2 Low Kick from Koraidon as well as +1 Arceus-Ground's Tera Ground-boosted Earthquake. Kyogre excels on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its excellent wallbreaking ability and good defensive utility. Arceus-Fairy is a fantastic teammate, as the two together make for perhaps the safest core against Scale Shot Koraidon in the tier. Additionally, Arceus-Fairy can come in on the Choice Scarf Koraidon that Kyogre attracts with ease while also providing Thunder Wave support that may allow Kyogre to get past Eternatus. Choice Scarf Koraidon and Miraidon are good partners for cleaning up weakened teams and can bring in Kyogre easily with U-turn to take advantage of Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh switch-ins. Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, and Clodsire are highly recommended for dealing with Miraidon, which can OHKO even boosted Kyogre. Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Gliscor also come with the benefit of Spikes support, chipping away at common switch-ins like Koraidon and Arceus-Water. Necrozma-DM can handle Eternatus and Zacian-C, with Kyogre coming in on Ho-Oh and Ground-types for it in return. Choice Scarf Kyogre trades the defensive utility and wallbreaking prowess of other sets for the ability to revenge kill common threats such as Zacian-C, Arceus-Ground, and Deoxys-A. A full-power rain-boosted Water Spout is always capable of OHKOing the aforementioned Pokemon and deals significant damage to all neutral targets, having good odds to OHKO Necrozma-DM and, with the help of entry hazards, most Arceus formes. Additionally, Water Spout can 2HKO Miraidon, preventing it from switching in. Origin Pulse is Kyogre's best STAB move if Water Spout's power is weakened, as Surf is unable to reliably OHKO crucial targets such as Ho-Oh. Ice Beam hits Koraidon hard and is the only way for Kyogre to damage Clodsire. Thunder's perfect accuracy in rain and chance to paralyze foes makes it a safe move to use without the need for prediction, and it almost always 2HKOs Arceus-Water and opposing Kyogre, which resist Kyogre's other moves. A Timid nature with a Choice Scarf enables Kyogre to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and is necessary to outspeed Zacian-C, Kyogre's most important target to revenge kill. Tera Water provides a considerable power increase to Kyogre's STAB moves, allowing it to overpower its checks and clean up weakened teams. For example, even the bulkiest Eternatus has a chance to be 2HKOed by Tera Water-boosted Water Spout. Because of its vulnerability to entry hazards and lack of defensive investment, Choice Scarf Kyogre requires dedicated support from its teammates to be effective. Kyogre should avoid taking damage at all costs, as Water Spout's Base Power is directly tied to Kyogre's health, so hazard control and pivot support are both invaluable to this set. Giratina-O and Corviknight can provide Defog support and handle Extreme Speed Arceus for Kyogre. Koraidon and Miraidon can bring Kyogre in safely with U-turn and appreciate Kyogre threatening their common switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Arceus-Ground. Koraidon and Kyogre together can also help overwhelm Arceus-Water, which can usually handle them individually. Choice Scarf Kyogre's ability to revenge kill Zacian-C gives teammates like Koraidon and Necrozma-DM the option to run setup sets that might otherwise struggle into teams with Zacian-C. Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is an especially great partner, as it turns Choice Scarf Kyogre's two most difficult defensive answers, Clodsire and defensive Eternatus, into setup fodder. A reliable Koraidon answer like Arceus-Fairy is helpful for this set, since Koraidon can take Kyogre's STAB moves without fear and deal significant damage in return or set up with Swords Dance. Although Miraidon cannot safely switch into Kyogre, it can easily threaten to KO it with a super effective Electric-type move, so Ground-types like Arceus-Ground, Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Clodsire are good partners. The latter three can set hazards, aiding Kyogre in softening foes that aren't relying on Heavy-Duty Boots. In exchange for some of Kyogre's flexibility, Choice Specs makes Kyogre a devastating wallbreaker. Rain-boosted Water Spout annihilates anything outside of Koraidon, Eternatus, and Clodsire. Ice Beam always OHKOes Koraidon and 2HKOes Eternatus and Clodsire. Thunder blasts through Arceus-Water and opposing Kyogre, which resist the aforementioned moves. Origin Pulse provides an alternative strong STAB attack should Water Spout's power be weakened. The EVs allow Kyogre to always OHKO Koraidon, with the HP and Defense investment allowing Kyogre to live a four-hit +2 Scale Shot from it. 16 Speed EVs let Kyogre outspeed paralyzed Zacian-C and Deoxys-A. If bulk is not a concern, then spreads with more Speed investment can be run to more reliably outspeed other base 90 Speed Pokemon like opposing Kyogre and Giratina-O. Max Speed with a Timid nature can be run to outspeed support Arceus formes and is highly recommended for Sticky Web teams to outspeed Zacian-C. Tera Fairy and Tera Ground let Kyogre get the jump on Koraidon and Miraidon, respectively. Choice Specs Kyogre requires more support than other Kyogre sets, as its lack of Heavy-Duty Boots gives it less defensive utility and makes Water Spout liable to being weakened from entry hazard damage. Defog users like Giratina-O and Corviknight are highly recommended due to this, and combined with Kyogre, provide a strong defensive backbone against Arceus-Ground. Koraidon and Miraidon are great partners, as their U-turn on common switch-ins like Ho-Oh, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor lets Kyogre come in much easier and wreak havoc. Choice Specs Kyogre can often lure in and KO Choice Scarf Koraidon, so teammates like defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Extreme Killer Arceus work well in combination. Arceus-Fairy provides critical security against Koraidon, especially as this Kyogre set cannot handle Koraidon as well as other Kyogre sets, and can help Kyogre break much easier with Thunder Wave support. Substitute is an option to allow Kyogre to bypass Eternatus and Clodsire's Toxic, but this set requires Thunder Wave and high bulk investment to work and is generally outclassed by more offensive sets that can threaten Koraidon, Miraidon, Arceus-Water, and opposing Kyogre more effectively. Rest is inadvisable thanks to Miraidon's Electric Terrain preventing its use. Mystic Water and Water Spout may be run on a Thunder Wave set. This gives Kyogre a 64.5% chance to 2HKO Eternatus with Water Spout at full HP, but this set is too vulnerable to entry hazard damage to be realistic. Eternatus: Eternatus is the most common hard check to Kyogre, as it outspeeds Kyogre and can Toxic stall it in conjunction with Recover. However, Eternatus must be careful of paralysis and Tera Poison. Koraidon and Miraidon: Koraidon's sun severely weakens Kyogre's Water-type attacks, effectively negating any of Kyogre's wallbreaking ability. Miraidon has good special bulk and can power through even boosted Kyogre. However, both Pokemon loathe coming in on Ice Beam. Clodsire: Thanks to Water Absorb, Clodsire can use Toxic against Kyogre and stall out Ice Beam with Recover. However, since Clodsire is slower, it runs the risk of being frozen by repeated Ice Beams, and boosted Ice Beams will 2HKO Clodsire. Tera Steel Clodsire hard walls Kyogre and has next to nothing to fear from it. Water-types: Kyogre can pivot into opposing Kyogre using Ice Beam and trade with it using Thunder. Arceus-Water, especially Calm Mind variants, is a decent check to Kyogre sets that lack Thunder. Giratina-O: Giratina-O is bulky, resists Water, and can shave off over half of Kyogre's HP with Poltergeist while often being faster than it. However, it must watch out for Ice Beam. Arceus-Grass: Albeit rare, Arceus-Grass can hard wall anything Kyogre can throw at it, match Kyogre's boosts with Calm Mind, and do massive damage back with Grass Knot."

    "name": "Kyurem",
    "text": "When using Choice Specs, Kyurem becomes a devastating wallbreaker thanks to its great offensive typing alongside its naturally sky-high Special Attack. Freeze-Dry helps Kyurem in dealing with bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Dondozo, and common Tera Water users such as Gliscor and Galarian Slowking. Earth Power finds itself in the last slot, allowing Kyurem to hit Galarian Slowking hard as well as Pokemon that resist its STAB moves, examples being Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo. Blizzard is an option over Draco Meteor that should only be run alongside Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking; it deals immense amount of damage to neutral and even resisted targets, letting it overwhelm Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo that tries to pivot around its Ice Beam more easily. Tera Ice provides the most amount of damage possible to its Ice-type STAB moves, which can potentially OHKO naturally high specially defensive behemoths like Clodsire and Toxapex with Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry, respectively, as well as 2HKO offensive Gholdengo and Kingambit with Ice Beam. Meanwhile, Tera Ground can be used to boost up Earth Power, having a chance to OHKO bulky variants of Kingambit and Gholdengo, as well as provide a Rock resistance, which lets it take on Stealth Rock and the dangerous Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave more easily. Finally, Tera Fairy provides Kyurem with an immunity to Dragon-type attacks such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and opposing Kyurem's Draco Meteor, coupled with a newfound Fighting resistance against moves like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta's Close Combat and Corviknight and Skarmory's Body Press. A Timid nature is preferred for its ability to outspeed key threats like Tinkaton, Landorus-T, and Gouging Fire as well as Speed tie opposing Kyurem, but a Modest nature can be used for more firepower, letting Kyurem overwhelm its checks like Galarian Slowking much more easily. Kyurem often founds itself in bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to destroy common walls. While Kyurem's typing is amazing offensively, defensively it makes Kyurem hard to switch in due to its numerous weaknesses combined with its average Speed tier. To solve this, pair Kyurem with pivot users; Kyurem's best friend is Galarian Slowking, which brings Kyurem in safely and provides snow with Chilly Reception as well as switch into Fairy-types like Enamorus and Iron Valiant. Kyurem needs entry hazard removal to not get worn down quickly by hazard-stacking teams; therefore, Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Excadrill are great partners. Corviknight can take Fairy- and Dragon-type moves, clear out hazards with Defog, and provides a slow U-turn to get Kyurem in safely. Additionally, Cinderace can use Court Change to use the hazards against the opposing team and can also lure in and pivot out of checks such as Toxapex and Gliscor with U-turn for Kyurem. Hatterene is also a good partner for Kyurem, which can deflect hazards with Magic Bounce, slow down faster threats with Nuzzle, and give Kyurem a second chance at wallbreaking with Healing Wish. Physical attackers like Meowscarada can be used to scare away common special walls thanks to its crippling STAB Knock Off to make Kyurem's attacks more impactful. Another strong physical attacker is Kingambit, which threaten some of Kyurem's checks like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and specially defensive Clefable. In return, Kyurem can break past their defensive checks such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Great Tusk. Gholdengo makes for an amazing partner, as it can switch into super effective moves aimed at Kyurem and threaten Galarian Slowking and Fairy-types with its STAB moves; in return, Kyurem beats Unaware Clodsire for it. Kyurem can take advantage of hazard-stacking teams to be even harder to wall, so common hazard setters like Skarmory, Ting Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor can be helpful, with the latter two having Knock Off on their arsenal as well to cripple Kyurem's defensive checks. Heavy-Duty Boots Kyurem is an incredibly powerful Pokemon with very few switch-ins, leveraging its hefty natural bulk and monstrous offensive stats to threaten a large portion of the tier with its perfect coverage. Both Ice Beam and Freeze-Dry are fantastic STAB options, with the raw power of Ice Beam supplemented by Freeze-Dry's super effective coverage into bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Dondozo. Earth Power is a great coverage move that allows Kyurem to hit common switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran, and Draco Meteor rounds out the set with a powerful nuke that tears through neutral targets like Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Terastallized Ting-Lu while securing a notable OHKO on Gouging Fire. Scale Shot is a weaker alternative to Draco Meteor that boosts Kyurem's Speed to patch up its middling Speed tier and thwart revenge killing attempts by otherwise faster Pokemon such as Dragapult and Zamazenta. It also targets special walls like Blissey on their frailer Defense. Scale Shot variants should run an EV spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe alongside a Naive or Hasty nature; a Naive nature is preferred in order to take on Kingambit's Sucker Punch easily and survive Iron Boulder's Mighty Cleave from full HP, but a Hasty nature lets Kyurem avoid an OHKO from Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Ice synergizes with Kyurem's double Ice-type STAB attacks to blast holes through teams, allowing it to 2HKO both physically defensive Clefable and Corviknight with Ice Beam. Tera Ground can be used instead to change Kyurem's defensive profile entirely while giving it a STAB boost to Earth Power, securing crucial 2HKOs on both Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge along with dropping offensive Gholdengo in a single hit. Additionally, both Tera types drop Kyurem's weaknesses to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult and Enamorus, with Tera Ground also removing its Fighting- and Rock-type weaknesses to block revenge killing attempts from Zamazenta and Iron Boulder. A Timid nature is used to outspeed important foes like Tinkaton, Gouging Fire, and Landorus-T; alternatively, the power boost from a Modest nature can be considered, notably letting it reach feats such as OHKOing Dragonite and 2HKOing Clodsire with Ice Beam. Kyurem is a perfect fit for entry hazard-stacking teams that opt to neglect removal in favor of putting hazards up on both sides, as Heavy-Duty Boots allows Kyurem to switch in freely, and its lack of power from no boosting item is made up for by switch-ins being forced to take chip damage on entry. Good defensive hazard setters that pair well with Kyurem include Skarmory and Gliscor with their Steel- and Fighting-type resistances, respectively. Faster teammates are also appreciated to help cover for Kyurem's mediocre Speed, with fast Knock Off users such as Meowscarada and Weavile being great picks for balance teams and Iron Boulder as a good pairing on more offensive builds. Another partner that works particularly well is Knock Off Clefable, which switches into Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks from Dragapult and Zamazenta and invites in Kyurem's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Air Balloon Heatran to remove their items, making them more susceptible to chip damage and allowing Kyurem to hit the latter two with Earth Power. Galarian Slowking itself is a bulky pivot that has great synergy with Kyurem, as it stifles revenge killing attempts with Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from checks like Iron Valiant and Enamorus, and it can not only can bring in Kyurem freely with Chilly Reception but also sets up snow to make it significantly harder to revenge kill. Offensively, Kyurem pairs well with threats that can force in walls weak to it such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Great Tusk, making Kingambit a natural partner. Dragon Dance Kyurem is an effective setup sweeper with great bulk and two strong physical STAB moves in Loaded Dice-boosted Icicle Spear and Scale Shot, capable of outspeeding would-be revenge killers such as Dragapult and Booster Energy Great Tusk after a single boost. Tera Blast Ground gives Kyurem the coveted near-unresisted Ice + Ground STAB combination. This allows Kyurem to break past otherwise troubling Pokemon like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Tera Blast Fire is another option to similarly hit the Steel-types super effectively, matching up better against Skarmory and Air Balloon variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit at the cost of unable to hit Heatran. Additionally, Tera Fire grants Kyurem a Steel and Fire resistance, letting it set up on Gholdengo and Cinderace and prevents it from being revenge killed by Scizor easily. Substitute is an alternative option over Tera Blast that relies less on Terastallization, allowing Kyurem to dodge status moves and to scout potential switches or Terastallization. Tera Fairy is a more defensive choice, trading its Dragon and Fighting weaknesses for an immunity and a resistance, allowing Kyurem to safely take a hit from Pokemon like Dragapult and Iron Valiant to OHKO them back with Icicle Spear. Tera Steel enables Kyurem to easily take moves like Make It Rain from Gholdengo and Mighty Cleave from Iron Boulder while being able to avoid Toxic from the likes of Toxapex. Dragon Dance Kyurem is best used on offensive teams that appreciate a strong physical setup sweeper that can muscle past the bulky Ground- and Dragon-types of the tier. It is one of the few setup sweepers that immediately threatens Gliscor and provides a way for hyper offense to resist the priority from Raging Bolt and KO it. Kyurem wants a teammate to provide some form of entry hazard control like Great Tusk, as Kyurem is weak to Stealth Rock and needs Loaded Dice to output consistent damage. It appreciates the support of Spikes from setters like Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott, as most of its checks are bulky grounded Pokemon. For example, one layer of Spikes allows Kyurem to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk and offensive Zamazenta without a Dauntless Shield boost at +1 and +2, respectively. Kyurem greatly enjoys snow from Alolan Ninetales's Snow Warning, as the Defense boost helps greatly in positioning Kyurem to get the free turns that it needs. Alolan Ninetales can also set up Aurora Veil to further ease Kyurem's setup. Bulky Steel-types like Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo all give Kyurem trouble unless it is Tera Ground and willing to commit the Tera, so teammates like Gouging Fire and Knock Off Iron Valiant help to pressure these foes. Bulky Water-types like Dondozo and Primarina can also consistently beat Kyurem one-on-one, so offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Meowscarada can be used to threaten them out. These also provide tools like Grassy Terrain to keep Kyurem healthy as it sets up and Knock Off to remove defensive items from Pokemon like Corviknight and Zamazenta. Other strong physical attackers like Gouging Fire can help to force in and wear down the Water-types that Kyurem struggles with. Very fast offensive Pokemon like Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant can outspeed even a +1 Kyurem and threaten huge damage with their super effective STAB moves. Because of this, Kyurem appreciates Pokemon like Gholdengo that can take hits from those fast threats and continue to apply offensive pressure. The mixed set brings out the best out of both sides of Kyurem's attacking capabilities, being able to break through would-be checks and thus turn itself into a monstrous wincon. What this set sacrifices in initial power is made up for in its versatility. Physical walls like Dondozo, Alomomola, and Skarmory looking to handle its Icicle Spear get 2HKOed by Freeze-Dry, while special walls like Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Fezandipiti trying to tank Freeze-Dry take heavy damage from a Dragon Dance-boosted Icicle Spear. Freeze-Dry is preferred over Ice Beam, as it allows Kyurem to significantly damage Water-type foes like Alomomola, Ogerpon-W, and Primarina, and Earth Power targets key foes such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Iron Crown that could otherwise take Kyurem on. 88 EVs in Special Attack guarantee the 2HKO on physically defensive Gholdengo with Earth Power. A Hasty nature allows Kyurem to live a Moonblast from Iron Valiant, while a Naive nature makes it take less damage from Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Never-Melt Ice enhances Kyurem's Ice-type attacks' damage output without locking it into one option and guarantees the OHKO with a three-hit Icicle Spear on Roaring Moon and Dragapult along with an OHKO on Hisuian Samurott with Freeze-Dry. Heavy-Duty Boots alternatively helps Kyurem bypass its Stealth Rock weakness; this alleviates the pressure in the teambuilder to pair Kyurem with strong support in the form of entry hazard removal. Tera Ice further pushes the power of its STAB moves to obscene levels; defensive staples such as Dondozo and Primarina fall in the range of being OHKOed, while Clodsire can’t stand more than two hits from Icicle Spear. Tera Ground instead gives Kyurem a nice boost to Earth Power that ensures the 2HKO on Garganacl, Gouging Fire, and even Assault Vest Iron Crown along with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Hatterene's Nuzzle. Tera Ground also gives Kyurem a neutrality to Fighting- and Steel-type moves, which can be decisive against Zamazenta, Gholdengo, and Iron Crown. Mixed Dragon Dance Kyurem fits on offensive teams as a wallbreaker capable of breaking past bulkier foes such as Galarian Slowking and Unaware walls such as Dondozo. Kyurem's main roadblock is Zamazenta, which outspeeds Kyurem and only takes neutral damage from Kyurem's attacks while being able to respond with a strong Body Press. Dragapult creates synergy, being able to switch in on Zamazenta's Fighting-type attacks, outspeed it, and force it to switch out. Dragapult can also spread status and overload shared checks like Kingambit to make it easier for Kyurem to sweep. Deoxys-S also makes for a great partner, as it also outspeeds and threatens Zamazenta while providing entry hazard support for Kyurem, which helps to chip down enemies such as bulkier variants of Primarina, Rillaboom, and Great Tusk that could otherwise take a hit. Alternative hazard setters include Great Tusk in more balanced teams and Glimmora or Hisuian Samurott in more offensively lenient teams. Bulky Steel-types that can handle Ground-type attacks like Corviknight, Air Balloon Tinkaton, and Scizor pose a significant problem to Kyurem, and Fire-types like Gouging Fire and Cinderace can neutralize them at a relatively low cost for themselves, in turn allowing Kyurem to sweep with minimal opposition. When it's opting to run Never-Melt Ice, Kyurem leaves itself exposed to hazards, which minimizes the amount of times it is able to come in a match. Hazard removal in the form of Great Tusk, Cinderace or even Corviknight can then be helpful to ensure Kyurem has a safe entry to wreak havoc. The HP EVs allow Kyurem to make 101 HP Substitutes, preventing them from being immediately broken by Blissey's Seismic Toss."

    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Chillingly powerful is quite the accurate description for Kyurem-B. With an Attack stat that eclipses even Calyrex-I, BoltBeam coverage, Dragon Dance, and Teravolt to boot, Kyurem-B is easily capable of ripping through bulky teams, with even Necrozma-DM struggling to stand up to its Fusion Bolt with Tera Electric and Miraidon's Electric Terrain. Its solid natural bulk also allows it to set up against passive Pokemon like Gliscor and Arceus-Water lacking Will-O-Wisp, and it threatens the specially defensive Ground-types used to stave off Miraidon like Arceus-Ground, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire. Unfortunately, Kyurem-B's part-Ice typing is a massive hindrance defensively, limiting its opportunities to set up despite its solid natural bulk. It can also be outsped by Choice Scarf Koraidon even after a boost or picked off by priority like Arceus's Extreme Speed or Kingambit's Sucker Punch. It also is not exactly the fastest Pokemon in the world, which in conjunction with its meager defensive profile limits what Kyurem-B can accomplish against offensive teams. With Dragon Dance, Kyurem-B can boost its Attack to even greater levels while also fixing its Speed issue. Icicle Spear and Fusion Bolt provide perfect coverage in Ubers, and Fusion Bolt's power can be increased further with Tera Electric and Miraidon's Electric Terrain. Tera Electric is also useful for the Steel resistance it provides, allowing Kyurem-B to set up on and threaten Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM without Earthquake, which would normally check it quite easily. Loaded Dice makes Icicle Spear and Scale Shot reliably strong STAB moves. Scale Shot is usually preferred over Substitute thanks to Kyurem-B's meager defensive profile, but Substitute can be used on dual screens hyper offense teams where its defensive problems are mitigated to set up freely on Gliscor and Arceus-Water and avoid revenge killing attempts from Choice Scarf Koraidon and Extreme Killer Arceus. Jolly is usually the preferred nature to let Kyurem-B outspeed Zacian-C with one Speed boost and Choice Scarf Koraidon with two, but Adamant is superior on Sticky Web teams where its Speed issue is mitigated. Due to being relatively weak without Terastallization and its defensive shortcomings, Kyurem-B fits best on hyper offense teams. Grimmsnarl's dual screens aid Kyurem-B further with setting up and even allows it to run Subsitute. Ribombee's Sticky Web mitigates Kyurem-B's Speed issue and allows it to run an Adamant nature. On both styles, Miraidon is a near-mandatory partner, setting up Electric Terrain for Kyurem-B to boost its Fusion Bolt and getting it in safely with U-turn. In return, Kyurem-B threatens Ground-types used to check Miraidon, like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Arceus-Ground. Necrozma-DM can serve as a check to Zacian-C and Arceus before Kyurem-B is ready to sweep, making it a good partner. Despite not being very apt defensively, Kyurem-B can switch into and set up on Kyogre once, making it a solid partner for Koraidon and Arceus-Ground. Kyurem-B also appreciates these Pokemon immediately threatening Necrozma-DM, which it can struggle against even if Necrozma-DM does not carry Sunsteel Strike. Tera Fire with Tera Blast can be used to destroy Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C at +1 while also avoiding burns from Ho-Oh. However, it is largely unnecessary given how strong +1 Tera Electric Fusion Bolt is. Arceus-Fairy: Arceus-Fairy can easily take everything Kyurem-B throws at it, has reliable recovery, and can threaten Kyurem-B with super effective Judgment or Will-O-Wisp. Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh can survive +1 Fusion Bolt and threaten to burn Kyurem-B with Sacred Fire or phaze it with Whirlwind. Tera Fairy Ho-Oh also survives everything +1 Kyurem-B can throw at it. Speed Control: Choice Scarf Koraidon outspeeds Kyurem-B even after a Dragon Dance and threatens it in return. Extreme Killer Arceus and Kingambit threaten to pick off Kyurem-B with Extreme Speed or Sucker Punch. Residual Damage: Kyurem-B has no recovery and is vulnerable to all forms of residual damage, even being weak to Stealth Rock. Steel-types: While they're not hard counters, Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C resist Icicle Spear, can take +1 Fusion Bolt, and retaliate with super effective STAB moves, and Necrozma-DM can heal off the damage. They must, however, be wary of Kyurem-B Terastallizing into an Electric-type. Trick Room Pokemon: Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-I, and the rare Necrozma-DW can take boosted attacks from Kyurem-B and turn the tables on it with Trick Room. Ditto: While it's rare, Ditto can reliably revenge kill Kyurem-B. It must, however, watch out for Substitute on dual screens teams."

  "Landorus-Therian": {
    "name": "Landorus-Therian",
    "text": "Landorus-T acts as important glue on offense teams thanks to its valuable role compression courtesy of its utility options and defensive profile; it functions as a Stealth Rock setter, defensive pivot, and blanket check to the metagame's prominent physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta while chipping them down with Rocky Helmet in the process. Earth Power lets Landorus-T check IronPress Zamazenta and Bulk Up Great Tusk has the added benefit of not being weakened by Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain, but Earthquake can be used instead to hit Galarian Slowking and Calm Mind Raging Bolt hard and makes use of Landorus-T's huge Attack stat in general. Aside from popping Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran's Air Balloons for Landorus-T to threaten them later, U-turn is incredibly vital to bring its teammates in safely, especially because it works incredibly well with Intimidate to soften the blow for an incoming teammate or gain momentum by forcing out the aforementioned physical attackers, all while chipping down switch-ins like Ting-Lu and Rillaboom. Taunt prevents entry hazards from a number of setters like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Glimmora, the last of which Landorus-T can anti-lead well with Earth Power to prevent Toxic Debris activation; stops recovery attempts from walls like Clefable, Dondozo, and Terastallized Garganacl; and limits setup attempts from Zamazenta, Air Balloon Kingambit, Dragonite, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, with the three capable of using Landorus-T as setup fodder otherwise. Especially for special variants, Taunt can be dropped for a coverage move instead; Psychic lets Landorus-T threaten Hawlucha, 2HKO maximum HP Great Tusk, and hit Zamazenta slightly harder, while Grass Knot is used to 2HKO Dondozo while denting Great Tusk even more. Landorus-T's Tera type is very flexible and mostly depends on what physical threats the team is weak to. Tera Water lets Landorus-T check foes like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott more reliably at the cost of making it unable to deal with Raging Bolt and Rillaboom, while Tera Steel improves the matchup against Rillaboom and Meowscarada but makes it unable to check Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Both Tera types also allow Landorus-T to deal with Weavile, with Tera Water being sturdier against Low Kick variants. Tera Grass is another option to check Ogerpon-W while still being great against Hisuian Samurott, Barraskewda, and Rillaboom, though it makes Landorus-T weak to Iron Moth, Cinderace, and U-turn from opposing Landorus-T. Tera Ghost can be used on special sets with Earth Power to let Landorus-T more reliably deal with IronPress Zamazenta—especially because it lacks the necessary Defense investment to repeatedly take on Zamazenta's Body Presses—and additionally prevents spinners like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Stealth Rock; however, it can no longer switch into Kingambit and Roaring Moon afterwards. A Timid nature is optimal for Earth Power variants, whereas a Jolly nature should be used if running Earthquake. Landorus-T is most effective on offense and bulky offense teams. Any offensive Pokemon generally appreciates the utility it brings to the table, with the likes of Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Kingambit loving its ability to bring them in safely into the field via U-turn to either set up or wallbreak, especially against Landorus-T's incoming switch-ins; the first two threaten bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Dondozo—with Ogerpon-W dealing with opposing Landorus-T and Gliscor as well—while Raging Bolt pressures Skarmory and Defog Corviknight, preventing Landorus-T's Stealth Rock from being removed. Moreover, their ability to force switches works well with Landorus-T's Stealth Rock, which can be further supported by other offensive threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Rillaboom that can use Knock Off against Heavy-Duty Boots users like Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Dragonite. Iron Valiant in particular can also be handy in covering for IronPress Zamazenta and Bulk Up Great Tusk if Landorus-T lacks Earth Power; other Pokemon like Choice Scarf Enamorus and Will-O-Wisp Dragapult are great options in this regard as well. The aforementioned Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom also appreciate Landorus-T's ability to switch into their offensive checks, namely opposing Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. In return, some of them possess defensive properties that aid Landorus-T; Ogerpon-W and Primarina can switch into foes like Barraskewda and Walking Wake, while Kingambit and Zamazenta can either handle or soft check Meowscarada and Weavile. IronPress Zamazenta especially appreciates Landorus-T checking Kingambit and Roaring Moon for it to remain healthy and sweep late-game much more easily. Galarian Slowking deserves a special mention as a specially defensive pivot that pairs well with Landorus-T on bulky offense structures; aside from forming a strong VoltTurn core and providing further support for the team in the form of status-spreading and Future Sight, together they form a strong defensive backbone to blanket check all threats in the metagame. Galarian Slowking is adept at switching into and dealing with most special threats, including Iron Valiant and Walking Wake, while Landorus-T handles the likes of Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads for it in return. With the combination of its ability, stats, movepool, and typing, Landorus-T is one of the best bulky pivots in the tier. Landorus-T can also be useful against physical threats, chipping them with Rocky Helmet and reducing their damage with Intimidate. Stealth Rock allows it to bring utility to the team, and it can set them up after it comes in on the many Pokemon it checks. It is also able to keep them up either against the Defoggers or the spinners of the tier, depending on if it runs Taunt or Grass Knot, respectively. Earth Power chips key Pokemon like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Great Tusk, but Earthquake can be used as a powerful STAB move in general, hitting hard even if uninvested. U-turn means that Landorus-T can come on the field and check some key Pokemon like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and non-Ice Spinner Dragonite while also gaining mometum with ease. Taunt can be used to prevent Pokemon like Gliscor and Ting-Lu from putting up entry hazards against it, letting it U-turn after to an ally that can threaten them out. It is also useful to limit setup sweepers like Dragonite and Kingambit, making them easier to revenge kill. Grass Knot is an alternative mostly to hit Great Tusk and Ting-Lu harder while staying on the field. Landorus-T can run an Impish nature with Earthquake and U-turn to do notable damage or go with a Bold nature to not weaken its Earth Power and Grass Knot. A Landorus-T using Taunt will run 36 Speed EVs to outspeed defensive Gliscor, preventing it from setting up Spikes or using Toxic, meaning it can reliably pivot out on Gliscor without its teammates needing to worry about those moves. However, maximum HP and Defense investment can be used to maximize its defensive capabilities. Tera Water is used as an overall great defensive type, letting it turn the tables on Great Tusk's Ice Spinner and Weavile's Triple Axel as well as Fire-type attacks. It synergizes well with its Rocky Helmet by punishing those contact moves hard, particularly weakening Weavile heavily, if it decides to Tera. Tera Steel is also an option, letting it resist Ice-type attacks, notably Ice Beam from Darkrai and Deoxys-S, and to be able to more reliably check Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Meowscarada. It is important to note that Tera Steel leaves it vulnerable to Earthquakes from opposing Landorus-T, as well as Great Tusk. Rocky Helmet in general is useful to punish opposing Landorus-T U-turns, as well as moves from some key Pokemon like Zamazenta. Due to its characteristics, Landorus-T fits on more on offense and bulky offense teams, which love its ability to support its teammates by letting them come on the field safely. It is a good partner for Gholdengo, especially defensive variants, as it appreciates Landorus-T's ability to switch into some of the Dark-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon, while Gholdengo forces Skarmory, opposing Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Corviknight to switch out, even preventing a Defog from the latter. Ogerpon-W is also a good choice, as Landorus-T can minimize the damage from Raging Bolt and Rillaboom while chipping them with the Rocky Helmet, U-turns, or its STAB moves. Kingambit is also notable, as it offers a switch-in to Meowscarada's and Weavile's Triple Axel, while Landorus-T can toy with Skarmory and Corviknight with Taunt and beat Zamazenta. Some of the scariest setup Pokemon benefit from Landorus-T's Intimidate to set up, including Kingambit and Ogerpon-W. Landorus-T will struggle to keep itself healthy on more balanced and defensive teams due to the lack of reliable recovery. Alomomola can be a good partner with its Wish while also being able to safely switch into Weavile, Great Tusk, and Barraskewda. Another good partner is Corviknight, which can come in on special Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Meowscarada more easily while creating a U-turn spam core. Offensive Landorus-T uses its massive Attack stat to its fullest, ripping apart opposing teams with ease while playing defensive and supportive roles simultaneously due to its excellent bulk, typing, and support moves. Stealth Rock helps Landorus-T pressure its own checks like Gliscor, Corviknight, and Skarmory and increase the threat level of its teammates; Landorus-T has no issue setting them due to its ability to force switches combined with its great bulk. Earthquake with Soft Sand is very difficult to switch into without an immunity, having a chance to 2HKO offensive variants of Great Tusk and always 2HKOing Hatterene and Primarina. Stone Edge chips opposing Landorus-T while doing massive damage to Moltres, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Tera Flying Pokemon such as Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Roaring Moon. U-turn allows Landorus-T to pivot out of switch-ins like Gliscor and assists in positioning other threats on its team, while Taunt allows it to shut down defensive Pokemon like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl and deny setup sweepers like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Great Tusk. The given EV spread allows Landorus-T to survive Gholdengo's Make it Rain after Stealth Rock along with an intimidated Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel while maintaining its offensive presence. Tera Ground allows Landorus-T to OHKO Iron Valiant, Darkrai, and Hisuian Samurott while 2HKOing Alomomola after Stealth Rock. Tera Water gives Landorus-T a resistance to Water- and Ice-type attacks from Swift Swim sweepers, Darkrai, Weavile, and Great Tusk. Tera Ghost is an option to maintain hazards against Great Tusk and Iron Treads, but it provides little defensive value and leaves Landorus-T very vulnerable to Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Kingambit and Roaring Moon that it is otherwise tasked to check. Rocky Helmet is an alternative to Soft Sand, as while it sacrifices some of Landorus-T's breaking power against Pokemon like Alomomola and Great Tusk, it can get crucial chip damage on Pokemon like Zamazenta and opposing Landorus-T to enable physical teammates. Offensive Landorus-T fits perfectly on offense, providing these teams with a crucial Stealth Rock setter, offensive pivot, and Ground-immune Pokemon rolled into one. Gholdengo can provide excellent defensive utility for offense teams, blocking entry hazard removal attempts while checking Iron Valiant and Deoxys-S, and Landorus-T can in return take advantage of the Ground-types that threaten Gholdengo and ease its defensive burdens by checking Kingambit and Roaring Moon. Primarina can also be an excellent partner, able to check threats like Walking Wake, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile to further bolster a team's defensive backbone while being able to take advantage of Pokemon like Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T to force progress. In return, Landorus-T can switch into Raging Bolt's Electric-type attacks and force it out using the threat of an OHKO with Earthquake. Hisuian Samurott is a fantastic alternative as an offensive Water-type that forms a strong pairing with Landorus-T, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from physical walls and stacking Spikes that synergize with Landorus-T's Stealth Rock to put the opponent on an uncomfortably fast ticking timer. Landorus-T synergizes well with physical sweepers that can provide speed control while exploiting Stealth Rock and the holes made by Landorus-T's wallbreaking; Zamazenta and Kingambit are powerhouses that also provide further defensive support against threats that Landorus-T cannot handle alone such as opposing Kingambit, Darkrai, and Gholdengo, while Roaring Moon can use Knock Off to severely weaken Heavy-Duty Boots-reliant foes such as Moltres and Zapdos so that Landorus-T's Stealth Rock can later wear them down. All three of these Pokemon can also help in weakening or eliminating Gliscor, Corviknight, and Skarmory, a facet that this offensive Landorus-T much appreciates. Special wallbreakers like Kyurem, Iron Crown, Iron Moth, and Raging Bolt appreciate the entry points made by U-turn against Pokemon that can sit on Landorus-T like Alomomola, Corviknight, Gliscor, and Dondozo while appreciating having Landorus-T to fall back on, particularly if they opt to run Choice item sets; alternatively, these also enjoy Landorus-T having the ability to deny opposing hazards with Taunt. As a strong offensive pivot with solid defensive qualities due to intimidate, Landorus-T forms a great pairing on bulky offense with other pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Iron Crown that appreciate a teammate immune to Ground; these Pokemon can bring some special bulk to the table against foes like Iron Valiant and Kyurem without being passive themselves, and their Future Sight can be incredibly hard to switch into when backed up with Landorus-T's Earthquake. Choice Scarf Landorus-T is an excellent speed control, revenge killer, and offensive pivot that also provides defensive utility thanks to its typing and Intimidate to slow down the tier's physical threats like Kingambit and Cinderace. Tera Blast is an incredibly valuable offensive tool for Landorus-T, expanding its coverage and amplifying its threat; Tera Blast Ice allows it to OHKO Gliscor, Hydrapple, and opposing Landorus-T that would otherwise be able to switch into it, but Tera Flying turns Tera Blast into a brutally powerful STAB option that meaningfully threatens Zamazenta while still slamming Great Tusk, Sinistcha, and Hydrapple, in addition to maintaining its Ground immunity and Fighting resistance. Stone Edge discourages Moltres and Zapdos from safely switching in and grants it additonal coverage against Flying-types if another teammate has already Terastallized. U-turn allows Landorus-T to generate momentum for its team while safely bringing in one of its teammates; its boosted Speed makes it an excellent user of the move. Minimal investment in bulk is recommended, as it allows Landorus-T to survive Gholdengo's Make It Rain after Stealth Rock and -1 Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel from full HP. This set is mostly seen on bulky offense teams that appreciate its role as a pivot and a revenge killer. Galarian Slowking is an excellent partner for it, as it can reliably handle Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Choice Scarf Enamorus that would otherwise outspeed it, and it appreciates Landorus-T for being able to threaten the likes of Kingambit and Roaring Moon. Backup defensive switch-ins like Great Tusk and Corviknight are appreciated; they provide Landorus-T with extra insurance against Kingambit and Gliscor, and act as much-needed hazard control for when Landorus-T needs to Terastallize. Kingambit and Roaring Moon are also fantastic partners for Landorus-T, and can punish Pokemon like Great Tusk and Flying-types such as Dragonite and Enamorus for attempting to exploit Landorus-T if it's locked into a resisted move. Lastly, Landorus-T struggles to break past physically defensive walls, notably Alomomola and Corviknight; thus, wallbreakers such as Ogerpon-W and powerful special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Kyurem make for incredibly valuable teammates and can enable it to pick off weakened foes late-game. These Pokemon also greatly enjoy having Landorus-T bringing them onto the field with its fast U-turn, in addition to it picking off faster threats like Dragapult and Darkrai. Kingambit is another Pokemon that appreciates having a fast pivot that provides it with a safe entry point and can open up for a late-game sweep. Landorus-T also enjoys Kingambit's powerful Sucker Punch for being able to pick off faster Pokemon like Iron Moth and Walking Wake."

    "text": "Mega Latias uses its immense bulk, decent defensive typing, and Spikes immunity to become a consistent utility Pokemon that is able to spread paralysis and cripple Pokemon that would otherwise offensively pressure it such as Mega Scizor and Tapu Lele while also checking threats like Mega Charizard Y and Ogerpon-W. Psychic hits Zamazenta harder and has good neutral coverage, but Psyshock can also be used hit harder against Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Ogerpon-W when Terastallized. Aura Sphere complements Mega Latias well, hitting Dark- and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar. Ice Beam can also be used to hit Ground-types that are able to take advantage of Mega Latias’s passivity, such as Gliscor and Garchomp. Draco Meteor is a niche option that can be used to hit Pokemon like Raging Bolt and Gouging Fire. However, giving up Aura Sphere means Mega Latias has no way of threatening Ferrothorn, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar for consistent damage. Thunder Wave allows Mega Latias to severely cripple setup sweepers and offensive threats like Mega Scizor and Volcarona. Although Mega Latias has Thunder Wave to cripple most of its checks, it has issues with Dark- and Steel types that are able to take advantage of its relative passivity, such as Mega Tyranitar, Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Weavile, especially if not carrying Aura Sphere. Teammates that are able to help against these Pokemon include Toxapex, Zamazenta, and Gliscor, making them good partners. Mega Latias also struggles against Dragon- and Fairy-types that are either faster than it or immune to Thunder Wave, such as Raging Bolt, Iron Valiant, and Tapu Lele, so teammates that match up well against them like Ting-Lu, Corviknight, and Toxapex are good alongside it. In return, Mega Latias is able to ease the offensive pressure these Pokemon take, using Thunder Wave to cripple their checks like Heatran, Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom. Mega Latias enjoys entry hazards wearing down its checks such as Mega Scizor and Mega Tyranitar, so Pokemon that set them like Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Gliscor are good teammates. With access to Calm Mind, Mega Latias is a threatening wincon, using its huge bulk, typing, and Spikes immunity to check and setup against Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Mega Medicham, and Zamazenta and potentially bowl over teams. Psyshock is used over other Psychic-type STAB moves due to its ability to hit Galarian Slowking harder as well as win against Pokemon that also boost their Special Defense such as Volcarona. Stored Power is another option that allows Mega Latias to boost past Unaware users such as Dondozo and Clefable while also becoming almost impossible to take on defensively after a few boosts. Aura Sphere hits Dark- and Steel-types such as Heatran, Mega Tyranitar, Weavile, and Ferrothorn, all of which would otherwise either completely wall it or remove it with Pursuit. Substitute is another option that allows Mega Latias to avoid status moves that would harm it greatly from the likes of Gliscor, Alomomola, Toxapex, and Galarian Slowking while also taking advantage of Pokemon that are unable to touch it such as Garganacl and Rotom-W. It is recommended that Substitute is always paired with Stored Power and vice versa, as Substitute allows Mega Latias to stack more Calm Mind boosts and make Stored Power much more impending against bulkier teams. Due to Mega Latias needing multiple Calm Mind boosts to be threatening, it can be offensively exploited by Pokemon like Weavile, Tapu Lele, and Iron Valiant, which can prevent it from setting up by offensively pressuring it. As such, checks to them like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Zamazenta are good partners. Even with Aura Sphere, Mega Latias still struggles with Dark- and Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, Mega Tyranitar, and Weavile. Mega Latias also has issues with prominent Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Iron Valiant. Teammates that can pressure these Pokemon like Zamazenta, bulky Volcarona, Heatran, and Zapdos are effective as such. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Gliscor and Ferrothorn also wears down these checks. In return, Mega Latias is able to take on Pokemon that are able to break through the balance teams that its teammates are found on, such as Ogerpon-W, Mega Medicham, and Zamazenta. Corviknight in particular is a very good partner for Mega Latias, as it checks Tapu Lele, Mega Scizor, and Weavile for it and removes hazards. In return, Mega Latias takes Electric- and Fire-types like Heatran, Rotom-W, and Mega Charizard Y."

  "Latios": {
    "name": "Latios",
    "text": "With its high Speed and Special Attack, Choice Specs Latios is a very deadly wallbreaker in UU, able to even break past checks such as Metagross, Slowking, and Tyranitar over time with its nuclear Draco Meteor. Surf nails Heatran and Excadrill while having good neutral damage against Scizor and Metagross. Flip Turn allows Latios to preserve momentum off of checks like Empoleon and Tinkaton coming in. Trick hinders Pokemon like Slowking and Tyranitar with a useless item for them but should only be used when Latios's Choice Specs is no longer needed, is not useful in the current matchup, or is more valuable to weaken said checks to open up another teammate to win. Latios can run other coverage moves too; Thunderbolt threatens Mandibuzz and Slowking, Shadow Ball hits Metagross super effectively while retaining coverage for Slowking, while Aura Sphere slams Tyranitar and retains the ability to break Heatran and Excadrill, but they generally are difficult moves to lock into compared to more standard options. Tera Dragon boosts Latios's Draco Meteor to absurd levels, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock and Slowking after very little chip damage as well as 2HKO specially defensive walls like Tyranitar. Tera Steel is an alternative that gives Latios greater defensive utility, being able to avoid revenge killing attempts from Pokemon like Greninja, Lokix, Mamoswine, and opposing Latios. Choice Specs Latios is a powerful asset on bulky offense and balance builds for its powerful wallbreaking capabilities. Physical attackers such as Scizor, Okidogi, Excadrill, and Cobalion excel at pressuring checks to Latios such as Metagross, Slowking, Tinkaton, and Tyranitar. Choice Scarf Okidogi also can revenge kill Greninja and swap into Lokix, while Excadrill provides entry hazard removal to keep Stealth Rock from wearing down Latios and switches into Tinkaton reliably. Tornadus-T and Lokix act as pivots that can wear down shared checks like Tyranitar and Tinkaton and enable Latios to wallbreak by bringing it in on other foes like Zapdos and Toxapex. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Tinkaton, Rhyperior, and Sandy Shocks does a great job at wearing down Metagross and Tyranitar into range of Latios's attacks; the latter two also check Zapdos due to the lower longevity Choice Specs Latios has. Defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, Slowking, and the aforementioned Tornadus-T can defensively solidify Latios's team due to its need to predict correctly or otherwise risk losing momentum, with the latter two being additional checks to threats like Keldeo. Zapdos and Slowking also provide paralysis support to mess with revenge killers like Lokix, Tornadus-T, and Greninja. Equipped with a Choice Scarf, Latios becomes one of the fastest revenge killers in the tier, taking out the likes of Ogerpon-C, Greninja, opposing Latios, and +1 Quaquaval as well as outpacing other Choice Scarf users like Hoopa-U and Okidogi. Flip Turn lets Latios retain momentum as a revenge killer, especially because its lower power means it can end up as a momentum sink if it locks into the wrong STAB move, not to mention it slightly chips switch-ins like Tinkaton and Excadrill for another teammate. Trick ruins defensive switch-ins like Slowking and Tyranitar but should only be used when Latios's Choice Scarf isn’t needed. Thanks to Latios's ability to still be useful with its STAB moves + Flip Turn, it can still use Trick more liberally than other Choice item users. Tera Dragon is best to get a power boost on Latios's Draco Meteor, being able to KO Assault Vest Tornadus-T in two turns after Stealth Rock as well as guaranteeing an OHKO on Ogerpon-C after Stealth Rock with a singular Draco Meteor. Choice Scarf Latios best fits on offensive builds that appreciate its lightning-fast revenge killing capabilities. Physical attackers like Rhyperior and Excadrill are able to pressure Steel-types like Tinkaton and Metagross for Latios; the former provides Stealth Rock support and a Zapdos switch-in while the latter offers entry hazard removal to keep Latios from being worn down by Stealth Rock, and in return, they enjoy Latios's ability to revenge kill Ogerpon-C, Cobalion, and Greninja. Zapdos, Slowking, and Cobalion can swap into attacks from Pokemon that take advantage of Latios being locked into an attack such as Metagross and Tyranitar. Zapdos, Slowking, and the aforementioned Rhyperior also check Assault Vest Tornadus-T for Latios. Lokix helps act as a secondary revenge killer against threats that don’t fear Latios like Scizor and Excadrill while wearing down Tinkaton and Tornadus-T. Lokix, alongside the aforementioned Slowking and Zapdos, also form pivoting cores with Choice Scarf Latios. Wallbreakers like Hisuian Arcanine and Greninja enjoy Latios's ability to give its Choice Scarf to Slowking and Tinkaton with Trick, in turn pressuring checks like Tyranitar and Metagross. With Soul Dew amplifying the power of its STAB moves, key defensive utility, and longevity, Latios is a formidable wallbreaker that can use its serviceable defensive utility in tandem with Recover to be an offensive threat that has longevity and key traits to bring to a team. Flip Turn allows Latios to gain momentum against and wear down threats like Excadrill, Slowking, and Tyranitar. Recover lets Latios pivot into the likes of Keldeo, Thundurus-T, Cobalion, and Zapdos while not having to worry about being worn down. Soul Dew amplifies Latios's STAB moves while keeping its move flexibility. Tera Steel lets Latios avoid getting revenge killed by Pokemon like Greninja, Mamoswine, and Lokix. It also lets Latios act as a reliable switch-in against Hydrapple and Rhyperior as well as giving it a Poison immunity, although it can no longer switch into Cobalion and Keldeo after Tera Steel. Latios largely fits on offense and bulky offense teams as a useful wallbreaker that provides much-needed defensive utility against foes like Zapdos and Cobalion. Pivots like Lokix and Zapdos can bring Latios in safely to wallbreak while helping it overwhelm shared checks such as Tinkaton and Tyranitar. Zapdos also checks Pokemon that threaten Latios such as Lokix and Excadrill, while Lokix revenge kills faster threats like Greninja and Choice Scarf Zarude. Tornadus-T can also bring Latios in safely while being a good source of defensive utility against the likes of Greninja and can wear down Pokemon like Slowking and Metagross for it. Tinkaton and Rhyperior can provide Stealth Rock support to put threats like Slowking and Assault Vest Tornadus-T in range of KOs more easily. Sandy Shocks can set up Spikes, help wear down Tornadus-T, and bring Latios in against Hydrapple. Araquanid is a good enabler for Latios on Sticky Web teams, slowing down faster threats like Greninja, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Choice Scarf Okidogi as well as helping it avoid a Speed tie with Ogerpon-C. Thanks to Terastallization, Latios utilizes Calm Mind in tandem with a STAB Thunderbolt to become an extremely powerful sweeper that plays a defining role in UU. Latios's natural bulk and high Speed allow it to gain setup chances with Calm Mind to snowball against common Pokemon like Zapdos and Rotom-W as well as others like Greninja and Tornadus-T post Tera, working in tandem with Draco Meteor to offset the Special Attack drops. Dragon Pulse is a weaker alternative that offers the benefit of not dropping Latios's Special Attack. Thunderbolt complements Latios's Dragon-type STAB attack to be an unwallable combination outside of Excadrill, targeting many Pokemon such as Azumarill, Toxapex, Tinkaton, and Metagross. Recover allows Latios to maintain longevity throughout the game and gain multiple chances to sweep while simultaneously providing natural defensive utility to its team against foes like Zapdos, Keldeo, and Thundurus-T. The passive recovery of Leftovers allows Latios to set up more easily without relying on Recover, but Ability Shield is an alternative to bypass Excadrill's Mold Breaker, allowing Latios to now set up on its biggest counter. However, this item relies on surprise factor and is vulnerable to being removed via Knock Off from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Metagross. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Latios to be a fast, hard-hitting natural threat that doesn't need to rely on boosts to be effective. Alternatively, 96 Speed EVs to outspeed Hisuian Arcanine, maximum HP investment, and the remaining EVs in Defense let Latios act as a bulkier sweeper to better stand up to foes like Metagross and Lokix at the cost of immediate power. Tera Electric is the driving point of this set, boosting Thunderbolt to powerful levels to get past foes like Tinkaton and Metagross more easily while also making it safer into Lokix and Tornadus-T, not to mention giving Latios no weaknesses thanks to its synergy with Levitate. Latios also gains an immunity to Thunder Wave from foes like Slowking and Tinkaton. Calm Mind + Tera Electric Latios fits on a multitude of archetypes ranging from offense to semi-stall, but it finds itself most at home on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its role as a reliable sweeper. Latios's biggest obstacle is Mold Breaker Excadrill, which handles its otherwise unresisted move combination, so Slowking and Hydrapple are great teammates to keep Excadrill in line. Slowking also provides slow pivoting support with Chilly Reception to get Latios in safely as well as provide speed control with Thunder Wave or amplify wallbreaking with Future Sight. Pivots like Zapdos and Lokix can bring Latios in to set up for a sweep while wearing down shared checks like Tyranitar and Tinkaton. Zapdos checks dangerous threats to Latios like Lokix, Tornadus-T, and Ogerpon. Meanwhile, Lokix exerts offensive pressure on the likes of Excadrill and Greninja for Latios. Stealth Rock support from Tinkaton and Rhyperior wears down foes like Toxapex and Assault Vest Tornadus-T into range of being KOed more easily. Tinkaton can also wear down Excadrill and Tera Fairy Hydrapple, while Rhyperior can pressure foes like Slowking and Mandibuzz. Skeledirge is another issue for this set, so Pokemon that handle it such as Excadrill, Ogerpon-C, and Mamoswine make great teammates. Latios is quite Tera reliant to function at its very best, so offensive threats that do not use Terastallization often like the aforementioned Excadrill and Mamoswine as well as others like Azumarill and Choice Scarf Okidogi form great offensive cores that can take out checks to Latios such as Tyranitar, Metagross, and Tinkaton."

  "Leafeon": {
    "name": "Leafeon",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 2-3 points Overview: Leafeon is a solid low-tier option for a physically defensive wall that can help patch up weaknesses to strong Ground-, Grass-, and Water-type attackers, boasting an excellent Defense as well as respectable Attack and Speed for a defensive Pokemon. However, it is not without downsides. Poor special bulk, abilities that are unhelpful in most situations, and a barren movepool in terms of coverage moves make it easily exploitable. Physically Defensive Tank: Leafeon's excellent physical bulk and access to reliable recovery allow it to act as an effective tank against physical attacks. Its Speed also lets it get the jump on many slower attackers and either hit them with moderately powerful STAB moves or use one of its utility moves. Setup Sweeper: When paired with teammates to set sun, or when playing against sun strategies, Leafeon can utilize Chlorophyll to outspeed every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame as well as the vast majority of boosted Pokemon. Alongside Swords Dance, it can be an effective sweeper once its checks have been weakened or eliminated. Primary STAB Moves: Leaf Blade, Solar Blade Setup Moves: Swords Dance, Trailblaze, Curse Utility Moves: Synthesis, Leech Seed, Roar, Yawn, Wish, Body Slam, Sunny Day Coverage: Knock Off, X-Scissor, Double-Edge, Aerial Ace, Quick Attack, Tera Blast Dig: Dig can be used alongside a Power Herb to give Leafeon a one-time way to hit the Steel-type Pokemon that would normally wall all of its moves. Copycat: As Leafeon can safely switch into most Ground-type Pokemon, Copycat can be used to give it extra utility by copying moves those Pokemon commonly use such as Stealth Rock and Spikes, and in some cases, it can even be used as a source of additional coverage by copying their attacking moves. Charm: Charm can be useful to stop physical attackers that are trying to set up in front of Leafeon or allow it to better take hits from certain attackers. Rocky Helmet: Rocky Helmet gives Leafeon a way to punish the physical attackers it commonly switches into, utilizing its bulk and recovery to endure multiple hits throughout a match. Heavy-Duty Boots: Heavy-Duty Boots assists Leafeon in staying healthy throughout a match, and they are most useful when the opponent's draft does not have many contact attackers that can be punished by Rocky Helmet. Leftovers: Leftovers helps Leafeon stay healthy throughout the match, but it should only be used over Heavy-Duty Boots if the opponent has poor options for setting entry hazards. Damage-boosting Items: Offensive Leafeon sets greatly appreciate damage-boosting items such as Life Orb, Miracle Seed, and Choice Band to reduce the amount of chip damage required before it can effectively sweep. Choice Scarf: Choice Scarf allows Leafeon to provide some form of speed control for its team by being able to revenge kill fast, frail attackers. Power Herb: Power Herb is used alongside Dig to have a one-time opportunity to hit Steel-types, and it can also be used with Solar Blade if a stronger Grass-type STAB move is needed for one target in particular. Leafeon can be a solid option for a secondary Tera Captain to go alongside a high-cost primary Tera Captain. Tera is most beneficial to offensive sets by giving it much-needed coverage, though it is also very useful for defensive sets to give it a better defensive matchup against specific threats. Tera Fire is the most common option for an offensive Tera type, as it deals with Steel-types that would otherwise wall Leafeon while also benefitting from the sun that is normally paired with offensive sets. For defensive Tera typings, Tera Water, Fairy, Steel, and Poison are all good picks and should be chosen depending on what threats Leafeon needs to check. Leafeon is a Pokemon that should generally be picked near the end of the draft. A draft should not be built around it; instead, it should be drafted to patch up specific weaknesses in an otherwise solid draft. Leafeon tends to work best when a draft is already able to provide the following: Checks to Special Attackers: Leafeon has very poor special bulk, which can be easily exploited by the strong special attackers in the format. Having a plan to deal with said special attackers is essential so that it does not become bait for these Pokemon to set up or wallbreak. Reliable Entry Hazard Setters: Leafeon frequently utilizes Knock Off in its moveset, which greatly assists in spreading chip damage through entry hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and other items from the opposing Pokemon. Sun-based Drafts: Without sun, Leafeon effectively has no ability. A draft that already utilizes sun can benefit from it acting as a cheap utility pick that can also be used as a surprise sweeper and speed control option. Steel-type Pokemon: Pokemon such as Kingambit, Scizor, and Corviknight effectively resist all of Leafeon's moves, effortlessly walling it and using it as bait to set up, wallbreak, or utilize their utility moves. It can, at most, remove their items or apply Leech Seed to them, but it is otherwise forced out, giving up momentum. Bug-, Fire-, and Flying-type Pokemon: Bug-, Fire-, and Flying-type Pokemon all resist Leafeon's STAB moves and are not weak to most, if any, of its coverage moves, being able to switch into it without much trouble and threaten massive damage to it. All of these Pokemon do have to be wary of Knock Off, as they all share a weakness to Stealth Rock and often run Heavy-Duty Boots to help against that. Special Wallbreakers: Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Raging Bolt, and Walking Wake can do massive damage to Leafeon or outright OHKO it, even if it's fully invested into Special Defense."

Tinted Lens prevents foes from playing around Lokix with defensive Terastallization, meaning they will all be hit for neutral damage at worst. Knock Off punishes common switch-ins like Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Sucker Punch is additional priority that allows Lokix to pick off foes like Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock and First Impression damage. Tera Bug is used to blow past Excadrill and Azumarill, letting Lokix KO the latter after Belly Drum if Stealth Rock is up. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Lokix to dash in and out of the field easily. Silver Powder puts an additional kick into First Impression, OHKOing Choice Scarf Mienshao, Assault Vest Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock, and Excadrill with a layer of Spikes after Tera Bug at the cost of Lokix taking entry hazard damage, limiting the amount of entry points in a game. On such sets, Leech Life can be used over Knock Off to retain longevity, at the cost of forgoing the ability to punish common switch-ins. Adamant should be used most often for maximum damage output, but Jolly allows Lokix to nail Hisuian Arcanine before it uses Extreme Speed and pivot out freely on Excadrill. Lokix fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, acting as a potent revenge killer to offensive threats. Offensive partners like Latios and Ogerpon-C appreciate Lokix's U-turn freely bringing them in on Cobalion and Zapdos. Removing Zapdos in particular is very important to let Lokix more freely pivot around without worry about Static. Slowking forms an excellent pivoting core with Lokix, as slow Chilly Reception can bring Lokix in safely on Pokemon that threaten Slowking such as Greninja and Ogerpon and it can handle the likes of Toxapex and Cobalion. Slowking's Future Sight support can also dissuade Toxapex and Okidogi from wanting to switch into Lokix in the first place. Other pivots like Zapdos and Thunder Wave Rotom-W can handle Tornadus-T through paralysis, giving Lokix more room to pivot in and out. Lokix greatly appreciates entry hazard support to more easily revenge kill Excadrill. Tinkaton appreciates Lokix's Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots for Stealth Rock while in return handling Ogerpon-C and Comfey. Spikes setters such as Sandy Shocks and Ogerpon can take on Zapdos and Hippowdon. Excadrill is a fantastic partner for Silver Powder sets especially, as it removes entry hazards for Lokix to freely pivot around and helps overwhelm Zapdos and Tornadus-T. In return, Lokix nails Hydrapple and can give Excadrill safe entry against Rotom-W and Toxapex. Slower wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mamoswine appreciate having faster checks like Ogerpon and Sand Rush Excadrill dealt with."

    "text": "Lugia is a solid wall and serviceable wincon for the sweeper teams it's placed onto thanks to its monumental bulk and Calm Mind. Air Slash is preferred over the stronger Aeroblast due to having a significantly higher PP count, allowing it to sweep teams without running out of PP against foes like Giratina and Palkia-O, though Psychic Noise is a solid alternative to block walls like Giratina, Blissey, and Arceus formes from healing off the damage it inflicts. Earth Power slams Steel- and Electric-types, like Kingambit, Magearna, and Arceus-Electric for super effective damage. Tera Fairy is a solid defensive typing that replaces Lugia's Dark weakness with a Dark resistance and grants it an immunity to Dragon Tail from Giratina and Dialga, though Tera Ground boosts Earth Power and gives it an immunity to Electric-type moves from Regieleki and Magearna is. Lugia can struggle to break through foes with Encore, status-inducing moves, Taunt, or phazing— like Giratina, Magearna, and Arceus-Dark—so Pokemon like Arceus-Dark, Chi-Yu, and Zacian that can beat these foes are all excellent partners. Lugia is a phenomenal mixed wall, being able to check many of the best wallbreakers in the metagame like Mewtwo, Palkia-O, and Landorus, so Pokemon weak to these threats, like Arceus-Dark, Great Tusk, and Toxapex, all adore its ability to check them."

    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Lunala possesses a small niche in Ubers as a setup sweeper thanks to its spammable STAB move, access to Agility, and good natural bulk courtesy of Shadow Shield. Its Ghost typing allows it to pressure notable threats like Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-I, and some Extreme Killer Arceus. However, Lunala faces direct competition from its fellow Ghost-types, Necrozma-DW, which fills an almost identical niche and is considerably stronger, and Flutter Mane, which boasts a better secondary typing and much better Speed. To make matters worse, even after a Special Attack boost, it lacks the power to get past many common defensive Pokemon in the tier, such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus, Ting-Lu, and Calm Mind Arceus formes. Additionally, Lunala's vulnerability to entry hazards and dependence on Tera to pick up KOs makes it difficult to justify on most teams. Agility aims to take advantage of Lunala's fantastic Ghost-type STAB move and respectable Special Attack to transform it into a threatening sweeper. 200 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Lunala to outspeed the entire metagame, including even +1 Speed Koraidon and Miraidon, after an Agility boost. The remaining EVs are invested into its HP to better take hits while setting up. Focus Blast, in combination with Moongeist Beam, gives Lunala perfect neutral coverage, and it crucially hits Dark-type Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Arceus-Dark, Kingambit, and Chien-Pao for super effective damage, easily OHKOing the latter two. Focus Blast also allows Lunala to 2HKO Extreme Killer Arceus, though Lunala must be wary of a potential Shadow Claw. Moonblast is a perfectly accurate alternative that forms similarly great coverage with Moongeist Beam and always OHKOes Koraidon, but it deals significantly less damage to Ting-Lu and fails to 2HKO Arceus and OHKO Kingambit. Meteor Beam not only gives Lunala a Special Attack boost, but it also OHKOes Ho-Oh, which is an otherwise problematic check for Lunala to deal with. Tera Ghost boosts the power of Moongeist Beam, which, after a Special Attack boost, allows Lunala to OHKO many neutral targets, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, and Zacian-C. Tera Ghost also removes Lunala's 4x weakness to Dark- and Ghost-type moves, allowing it to survive them if Shadow Shield is intact. Tera Fighting is an option when Lunala is running Focus Blast to, with a Special Attack boost, have a chance to OHKO Ting-Lu after damage from entry hazards and always OHKO Arceus and Arceus-Dark, while Tera Fairy allows Lunala to always OHKO Miraidon and 2HKO Ting-Lu with a boosted Moonblast. Both Tera Fighting and Tera Fairy negate Lunala's weaknesses to Dark and Ghost, with Tera Fairy having the additional benefit of an immunity to the numerous Dragon-type moves used in Ubers, notably enabling Lunala to check Koraidon with Shadow Shield intact. Lunala finds itself almost exclusively on hyper offense teams that cannot fit a more potent option, such as Necrozma-DW, where its single-use setup is not a problem. Special sweepers like Eternatus and Miraidon alongside Lunala can overwhelm checks like Ting-Lu and Clodsire and clear the way for each other to sweep. Dedicated leads, such as Glimmora, Deoxys-S, and Deoxys-A, can hinder opposing teams from setting entry hazards while setting entry hazards themselves to weaken foes for Lunala. Ho-Oh lures like Zacian-C, Scale Shot Koraidon, and Necrozma-DM running Stone Edge make for great teammates, since Lunala has a much easier time sweeping once Ho-Oh is removed. In return, Lunala's ability to shut down dangerous sweepers, such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Calyrex-I, in an emergency with Shadow Shield frees teammates to run offensive Tera types; for example, Tera Grass on Miraidon with Solar Beam or forgoing Tera Ghost on Arceus and Koraidon in favor of Tera Normal and Tera Fire, respectively. Psyshock can be used to beat Eternatus, Clodsire, and the rare Blissey, but it leaves Lunala completely walled by Ting-Lu and is largely useless against the rest of the tier. Calm Mind can be used with Heavy-Duty Boots as a boosting option over Meteor Beam. However, being unable to threaten Ho-Oh can be detrimental to Lunala's chances of sweeping, and Lunala will rarely get more than one turn to set up, so the immediate power of Meteor Beam is preferable. Ting-Lu: A healthy Ting-Lu can tank any attack Lunala throws at it and phaze it out with Whirlwind, set up entry hazards, or weaken it with Ruination. Ho-Oh: Once Lunala has used its Power Herb, Ho-Oh can comfortably phaze it out, wasting Lunala's boost from Meteor Beam, and heal off the damage with Regenerator. Entry Hazards: Since Lunala is required to run Power Herb, it is hit by all forms of entry hazards, which break its Shadow Shield and can put it in range of being revenge killed or outright prevent it from setting up. Dark-types: Although rare, Arceus-Dark, Kingambit and Chien Pao's Dark typing and the latter two's priority Sucker Punch make Lunala's prospects of sweeping grim. They have to fear a potential Focus Blast, but Arceus-Dark cannot be OHKOed unless Lunala Terastallizes Fighting, and Sucker Punch has favorable odds to OHKO Lunala even through Shadow Shield if Chien Pao is holding a Life Orb or Choice Band and Kingambit has multiple allies fainted. Special Walls: Walls like Eternatus, Clodsire, and Blissey can shut down Lunala through status or by stalling out the low PP of its moves."

  "Mabosstiff": {
    "name": "Mabosstiff",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 2-4 points Overview: Mabosstiff fits on drafts seeking a budget Dark-type and wallbreaker. It typically acts as a prediction-heavy Choice item attacker that can cause massive damage to incoming foes with Stakeout. Although its movepool is somewhat lacking in power and utility, it has a solid stat spread and three amazing abilities that it can leverage to fill various roles. Unfortunately, it faces fierce competition from many other Dark-types with better offensive traits and role compression. Wallbreaker: Stakeout grants a massive power boost if Mabosstiff is able to force out a foe, enabling many OHKOs and 2HKOs that it'd otherwise miss. Positioning it well can lead to difficult situations for the opponent where they're forced to sacrifice a Pokemon. Taunt can also be used to prevent foes from healing themselves. Physical Tank: Mabosstiff becomes serviceably bulky with Intimidate and defensive investment, allowing it to check foes that lack strong coverage moves for Dark-types while attempting to stay healthy with Pain Split and denying setup opportunities with Roar. Primary STAB Moves: Crunch, Lash Out Setup Moves: Trailblaze Utility Moves: Pain Split, Roar, Taunt, Destiny Bond, Rest Coverage: Play Rough, Psychic Fangs, Wild Charge, Fire Fang, Ice Fang, Double-Edge, Outrage Jaw Lock: Mabosstiff can trap a foe with Jaw Lock and then force a trade with Destiny Bond. Endeavor: The guaranteed damage of Endeavor is used to wear down walls and place them in range of a Crunch KO. Facade: Burn seriously hinders offensive Mabosstiff sets, and Facade is a way to remain threatening after being burned. Body Slam: Defensive Mabosstiff sets can use Body Slam to spread paralysis to incoming foes. Curse / Hone Claws: Mabosstiff can attempt to sweep or wallbreak using Curse and Guard Dog, though it struggles with longevity due to its lack of recovery and Speed. Hone Claws can be run alongside Trailblaze to attempt a sweep against slower teams, but it often needs multiple turns of setup to become dangerous. Payback: Payback is stronger than Crunch on Curse sets, where Mabosstiff usually acts last, or in the physical wall role. Choice Band: Mabosstiff deals absurd amounts of damage when stacking the boosts from Choice Band and Stakeout, scoring 2HKOs against many of the toughest walls if the correct attacks are chosen. Choice Scarf: Choice Scarf is an excellent item for Stakeout sets, giving Mabosstiff enough Speed to revenge kill unboosted foes while Stakeout grants extra power if the target switches out. Rocky Helmet: Defensive sets appreciate the guaranteed contact damage from Rocky Helmet as they switch in to activate Intimidate. Lum Berry: Mabosstiff appreciates protection from burn and paralysis, and Lum Berry can effectively grant it an extra turn to take down foes with access to those conditions. Damage-boosting Items: Items like Life Orb and Black Glasses help Mabosstiff break through teams when the damage from Choice Band isn't needed or the ability to switch moves is more important. Assault Vest: Assault Vest patches up Mabosstiff's average Special Defense, helping it deal with specially offensive Ghost-types. Resistance Berries: Defensive sets can use a resistance Berry to use Roar against a dangerous setup sweeper more reliably. Offensive sets can use it to lure in a foe and take them out with super effective coverage. Chesto Berry: Chesto Berry grants Intimidate and Curse sets a one-time heal when combined with Rest, extending Mabosstiff's time in battle and curing it of harmful status conditions. Sitrus Berry: Sitrus Berry provides defensive sets some extra HP, keeping Mabosstiff on the field for longer without the need for Rest. Mabosstiff can make use of Tera, but there are usually better options available. Tera Dark, Fairy, and Psychic enhance its strongest attacks on Stakeout sets, while Tera types like Tera Fighting and Ground grant it new coverage options via Tera Blast. Tera Water, Steel, and Ghost can help it safely set up with Curse against more foes. That being said, it's very difficult to justify using Tera on Mabosstiff over more expensive Tera Captains. Mabosstiff is taken at the end of a mostly-complete draft to patch up a weakness to Ghost or Psychic and provide extra physical power. Utility and most other roles need to come from the draft's other Pokemon. Defensive Backbone: Mabosstiff fits particularly well on teams with solid defenses to fall back on. They can protect offensive sets from being revenge killed and pivot to get it on the field. They can also help relieve the pressure placed on defensive sets to handle various foes. Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, Deoxys-D, and Moltres are a few examples of defensive Pokemon that work well with Mabosstiff. Cleaners: Fast cleaners like Greninja, Iron Moth, and Iron Boulder appreciate Mabosstiff's ability to smash through opposing walls. Faster Attackers: Mabosstiff is slower than many of the format's strongest attackers, which makes revenge killing a common way to stop it. As a Dark-type, it also has a few weaknesses that can be exploited by common moves like U-turn and Close Combat. Physically Bulky Pokemon: Much of Mabosstiff's power comes from Stakeout, so it can be helpless against bulky Pokemon that are already on the field. Additionally, setup sweepers like Zarude and Palafin can use moves like Bulk Up, Drain Punch, and Taunt to avoid being revenge killed or walled. Status Conditions: Burn and paralysis shut down most Mabosstiff sets, leaving it with little hope of pressuring foes."

  "Magnezone": {
    "name": "Magnezone",
    "text": "Choice Specs Magnezone is a high-voltage wallbreaker that takes advantage of the lack of special tanks in RU to blast holes in teams. Volt Switch lets it keep momentum flowing against switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra, Wo-Chien, and Umbreon. Tera Blast Grass targets Hippowdon, Tera Blast Ground hits opposing Magnezone, and Tera Blast Water helps against Entei. Analytic lets Flash Cannon OHKO Krookodile and gives it a chance to OHKO Hippowdon after Stealth Rock damage while also amping up Volt Switch to chip down switch-ins. Magnet Pull is used to trap Empoleon, Jirachi lacking U-turn, and Choice-locked Hisuian Goodra, enabling Magnezone to remove those checks for its teammates. Tera Grass lets Magnezone OHKO many Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon while resisting Ground-type moves like Earthquake, making it able to revenge kill Pokemon like Krookodile and Flygon. Tera Ground is useful on Magnet Pull sets to let it OHKO Hisuian Goodra, Bisharp, and opposing Magnezone. Tera Water is the more defensive Tera type, letting Magnezone resist Volcanion's STAB moves and Armarouge's Fire-type STAB moves and OHKO them back with Thunderbolt while still giving it a way to OHKO Ground-type switch-ins like Hippowdon. Magnezone fits well on balance and bulky offense teams and can be a strong member of a VoltTurn core alongside pivots like Cyclizar, Galarian Zapdos, and Noivern. Magnet Pull sets enable Dragon-type attackers like Salamence and Hisuian Goodra and Fairy-type attackers like Gardevoir to fire off powerful attacks after the opponent's Steel-type check has been trapped and eliminated. Ground-immune Pokemon are natural pairings with Magnezone, as they are able to switch into Earthquake from Hippowdon and Krookodile. Galarian Zapdos, Noivern, and Galarian Weezing fit that role and are also able to take resisted Fighting-type attacks from Mienshao and Conkeldurr for Magnezone. Defensive Grass-types, like Chesnaught and Wo-Chien, take little damage from Earthquake and can force out Ground-types. Cyclizar and Slowbro are able to switch into Fire-type attacks from Armarouge and Volcanion, which look to revenge kill Magnezone. Will-O-Wisp Galarian Weezing, Will-O-Wisp Slither Wing, and Scald Slowbro can all threaten to burn physical attackers like Krookodile and Mienshao that threaten to OHKO Magnezone. Pivot partners like Noivern, Cyclizar, and Galarian Zapdos can use U-turn to let Magnezone safely enter the field and threaten checks like Galarian Weezing and Fezandipiti. Ground-types like Krookodile and Hippowdon can set Stealth Rock to chip down checks to Magnezone like Umbreon and Wo-Chien, while Magnezone threatens Flying- and Water-types like Thundurus and Suicune. They also can switch into the Steel-types that wall Magnezone like Hisuian Goodra, threatening them out with Earthquake. Analytic Magnezone punches holes in defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Fezandipiti, and Chesnaught, allowing sweepers like Armarouge, Galarian Zapdos, and Choice Scarf Basculegion to clean up weakened teams. Assault Vest Magnezone uses its typing that is filled with key resistances to keep in check many of RU's special attackers and walls, such as Gardevoir, Jirachi, and Galarian Weezing, and turn them into opportunities to fire off its Analytic-boosted STAB moves. Discharge is chosen over Thunderbolt for the increased paralysis chance, as Magnezone will find many opportunities to enter the field and get a shot at paralyzing the foe. Body Press targets the would-be answers Hisuian Goodra, Chansey, and Assault Vest Cyclizar for a super effective hit on their weaker Defense stat; it is also coverage for opposing Magnezone. Tera Blast allows Magnezone to bait out and KO specific Pokemon that might otherwise cause trouble for its teammates. Tera Blast Flying hits Amoonguss and Wo-Chien, Tera Blast Water targets Armarouge, and Tera Blast Fairy nails the many Fighting- and Dragon-type Pokemon in the tier like Conkeldurr and Salamence. Mirror Coat can surprise Pokemon such as Armarouge, Focus Blast Thundurus, and Focus Blast Gengar attacking into Magnezone to KO them back, though it is prediction-reliant. Analytic is used over Magnet Pull, since the Steel-types of the tier either ignore it thanks to their access to pivoting moves or by trading damage well against Magnezone, so the added damage given by Analytic is preferred. Tera Flying turns Magnezone's Ground weakness into an immunity, so Magnezone can stay in against common foes with Ground-type coverage, such as Hippowdon, Krookodile, Revavroom, and Yanmega. It also turns its Fighting weakness into a resistance to retaliate against the likes of Galarian Zapdos and Slither Wing and removes its Fire weakness to help out against Armarouge and Volcanion. Tera Water turns Magnezone into a sturdy switch-in to the Water- and Fire-type attackers of the tier such as Volcanion and Basculegion-F. Tera Fairy is a fantastic defensive typing that grants a resistance to Fighting-type attacks and, unlike Tera Flying, does not give a Stealth Rock weakness. Tera Blast Fairy helps against key matchups such as Bisharp and Mienshao that carry moves that otherwise threaten Tera Flying Magnezone. 136 Speed EVs are needed to outspeed Adamant Conkeldurr. 88 HP EVs coupled with 76 Special Defense EVs guarantees that Magnezone can take an Armor Cannon from Timid Armarouge and retaliate. Magnezone fits well on offense and balance teams looking for a Steel-type Pokemon with great offensive pressure and a pivoting option. It can also bait in key targets and, depending on the fourth move it picks, heavily weaken them and allow a teammate to wreak havoc after their check was taken care of by Magnezone. Examples of this include picking Body Press to hit Hisuian Goodra and help Armarouge getting past it or picking Tera Blast Fairy to KO Cyclizar, allowing Gengar to fire off strong Shadow Balls freely. A VoltTurn core can be formed with the likes of Noivern and Gligar, which can take the Fighting- and Ground-type attacks targeted at Magnezone; in return, Magnezone can handle their counters, such as Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Galarian Weezing, respectively. Magnezone will often force Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Umbreon in to tank Volt Switch, so Fighting-type wallbreakers like Galarian Zapdos and Conkeldurr appreciate having a free entry point and threaten those switch-ins. As a slow offensive Pokemon, Magnezone loves paralysis support from the likes of Thunder Wave Slowbro and Stun Spore Slither Wing. Slowbro and Hippowdon are some of the sturdiest physical walls in the tier and help in providing a safe switch-in to physical wallbreakers, such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao, that can easily take out Magnezone. Armarouge and Volcanion are extremely dangerous Pokemon that also threaten Magnezone greatly, so Pokemon such as Umbreon, Hisuian Goodra, and Krookodile are great teammates that help play around those threats. Talonflame and Galarian Weezing both absorb Fighting- and Ground-type attacks for Magnezone and can use Defog to remove the Spikes that prevent Magnezone from entering the field to accomplish its pivoting role many times."

  "Mamoswine": {

    "text": "Mamoswine functions as an excellent wallbreaker thanks to its nearly unwallable Ice / Ground STAB combination and high base Attack, allowing it to break through common threats such as Hydrapple, Okidogi, Toxapex, and Zapdos. Ice Shard is a reliable priority move that allows Mamoswine to bypass its below average Speed to revenge kill foes such as Ogerpon-C, Latios, and Thundurus-T. Trailblaze not only raises Mamoswine's otherwise subpar Speed but also allows it to hit Rotom-W, the only Pokemon in the tier that can wall Mamoswine's STAB combination. Knock Off can be used as an alternative to cripple Rotom-W and other checks like Slowking by removing their items, allowing Mamoswine or another teammate to break through them more efficiently later on. Substitute can also be used as an option to force switches and grant Mamoswine a safety net, though it must be used in tandem with Leftovers to preserve Mamoswine's longevity. Never-Melt Ice further boosts the power of Mamoswine's Ice-type STAB attacks. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used instead to prevent Mamoswine from being chipped down by hazards, though it comes at the price of lower power. Thick Fat reduces the damage Mamoswine takes from Hisuian Arcanine's Flare Blitz, allowing it to easily OHKO it back while also allowing it to take Heat Wave from Zapdos and Tornadus-T. Tera Grass boosts the power of Trailblaze while allowing Mamoswine to tank powerful Water-type moves from foes like Greninja, Azumarill, and Quaquaval. It also helps Mamoswine handle Grass-types like Hydrapple and Ogerpon-C better, though it also makes Mamoswine weak to Zapdos and Tornadus-T's Hurricane and Lokix's First Impression. Tera Ice bolsters the power of Mamoswine's Ice-type moves even further, allowing it to score OHKOs with Ice Shard on Ogerpon-C, Latios, and Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. Tera Fairy can be used to give Mamoswine a resistance to Fighting-type moves, allowing it to better handle Cobalion and Choice Scarf Okidogi while still taking neutral damage from Water-type moves. Mamoswine fits best on bulky offense and offensive teams that appreciate its ability to wallbreak with its powerful STAB combination. Mamoswine's lackluster Speed and poor defenses make it hard for it to get in safely, which can be made easier by pairing it with pivots such as Lokix, Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Slowking. Lokix also helps revenge kill threats like Hoopa-U and Greninja that cannot be revenge killed with Ice Shard, and the latter three also handle Fighting-types like Okidogi and Cobalion that threaten Mamoswine; Zapdos in particular can handle threats like Azumarill, Scizor, and Metagross, all of which scare Mamoswine out with their super effective STAB priority moves. Mamoswine's biggest checks are Water-types like Rotom-W, Slowking, and Greninja, so Grass- and Electric- types like Hydrapple, Ogerpon, Serperior, and Thundurus-T make great partners to handle these threats. Entry hazard setters such as Cobalion, Tinkaton, and Excadrill help to soften up threats like Latios and Assault Vest Tornadus-T for Mamoswine in the late-game via chip from Stealth Rock. Excadrill in particular makes a great partner, as it can put pressure on Rotom-W with Mold Breaker Earthquake and spin hazards away. In return, Mamoswine handles threats like Hydrapple and Sinistcha, making it easier for Swords Dance Excadrill to clean up teams late in the game. Mamoswine does not like switching into Zapdos and getting chipped by its Hurricane, so Pokemon that can handle Zapdos, such as Sandy Shocks and Latios, make great partners. The former provides hazard support, also checks Cobalion and Scizor, and acts as a pivot with Volt Switch to safely bring Mamoswine in against Hydrapple and Latios, while the latter revenge kills Quaquaval and Cobalion for Mamoswine while working in tandem with it to overwhelm their shared check, Slowking."

    "text": "Mandibuzz has a solid niche in the UU metagame thanks to a unique and solid defensive typing, great mixed walling capabilities, and access to rare utility options like Defog and Toxic that make it a valuable addition to bulkier builds. Foul Play lets it threaten out Pokemon like Metagross, Excadrill, Scizor, and Belly Drum Azumarill. Defog lets Mandibuzz remove entry hazards for its teammates, especially against threats like Metagross and Rhyperior, although the latter might require more precise positioning than the former; it must be hit with Toxic first to be worn down, allowing Mandibuzz to utilize its natural bulk to tank Stone Edge, freely use Defog, and then use Roost to heal off the damage while not being trapped in a healing cycle due to the inability to progress against Rhyperior. Roost keeps it healthy throughout a match, allowing it to repeatedly come in and check Latios, Excadrill, Ogerpon, and Scizor. Toxic alleviates Mandibuzz's passivity a bit, threatening opposing bulky Pokemon like Slowking and Zapdos and setup sweepers like Nasty Plot Hydrapple and Calm Mind Tera Electric Latios. U-turn is an alternative to either Defog or Toxic that allows it to act as a slow pivot to maintain momentum against counters like Cobalion and Tinkaton, but Mandibuzz does not usually fit on the offensive structures that necessitate the need of U-turn to keep it from being a momentum sink. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps away the pesky damage from entry hazards. The given Speed investment allows Mandibuzz to outspeed Azumarill, while the Special Defense investment allows it to survive two Soul Dew-boosted Draco Meteors from Latios. Tera Steel helps Mandibuzz better answer foes like Latios and Greninja while flipping the script against foes like Ogerpon-C and shielding it from opposing Toxic. Tera Fairy lets it counter Dragon-types like Latios much more reliably, especially if it chooses to carry Toxic, and allows Mandibuzz to now gain a Fighting resistance while keeping its Ground neutrality against Excadrill. Mandibuzz best fits on balance and stall builds that enjoy its mixed walling and key utility features. Skeledirge is a great partner, as its typing and ability let it handle annoying Pokemon like Hydrapple and Cobalion somewhat consistently, while also helping against Tera Electric Calm Mind Latios. Toxapex also is a great partner, being a fantastic Knock Off absorber against Tornadus-T and Lokix, while also handling threats like Azumarill and Greninja that Mandibuzz struggles against. Tinkaton can not only act as a secondary check to Latios so that Mandibuzz won't get overwhelmed, but also beat the threatening Ogerpon-C. Mandibuzz also struggles a lot against Zapdos, so it synergizes well with Zapdos checks like Rhyperior, Hippowdon, and Bellibolt. In addition, Rhyperior and Hippowdon happen to also check Hisuian Arcanine, another Pokemon that Mandibuzz struggles against. Excadrill is another Pokemon that can give Mandibuzz trouble, so a check like Hydrapple or Slowking is necessary. Slowking also has the benefit of providing more assurance against Latios."

Mankey is one of the most powerful Choice Scarf users in Little Cup thanks to its high Speed, which allows it to outpace or tie with the entire unboosted metagame. This allows Mankey to beat other common Choice Scarf users such as Magnemite, Mudbray, and Gothita. U-turn allows it to greatly capitalize on the switches it forces. Earthquake is a powerful coverage move that hits Mareanie, Glimmet, and Voltorb. Assurance is used to deal as much damage as possible to Ghost-types, OHKOing Eviolite variants on the switch if Stealth Rock is up, while Ice Punch OHKOes Toedscool and threatens Flying-types like Wattrel. Stone Edge is an uncommon option to hit Larvesta and Flying-types. Vital Spirit can be helpful on teams lacking a Grass-type, as it provides a switch-in to Toedscool's Spore, while Defiant is very useful in matchups against Pokemon such as Sticky Web Surskit and Parting Shot Shroodle, as the Attack boosts make Mankey nigh unwallable. Tera Fighting allows Mankey to hit as hard as possible with Close Combat in situations where an unboosted hit is insufficient. Some of Mankey's best teammates include Toedscool to switch in on Ghost-types and remove entry hazards, which can hamper Mankey's pivoting abilities, and either Gothita or Diglett, which can remove the bulky Poison-types like Mareanie and Foongus that give Mankey trouble. Mankey also performs well as part of a VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Volt Switch Voltorb and U-turn Zorua."

Marill's unique movepool containing Whirlpool allows it to overcome its horrible offensive stats to trap and whittle down foes that it otherwise would not be able to handle. Dedicated Check: Baxcalibur. Chi-Yu. Meowscarada. These are just a few of the offensive behemoths that lose in a one-on-one fight with Marill. Unfortunately, Draft is not a one-on-one fight, so it needs to be careful preserving its HP and not letting other Pokemon take advantage of it. It can't deal meaningful damage to most Pokemon, especially when it is not running Huge Power, so incoming foes need to be punished with double switches or utility moves like Knock Off and Whirlpool. Primary STAB Moves: Aqua Jet, Liquidation, Play Rough Setup Moves: It technically has access to Belly Drum. Utility Moves: Whirlpool, Protect, Encore, Knock Off, Light Screen, Brick Break, Rest, Sleep Talk Coverage: Superpower, Ice Spinner Misty Explosion: Misty Explosion can deal a bit of damage and allow Marill to pivot to a stronger Pokemon at the cost of KOing itself. Endure: Endure can be used with a Red Card to phaze a foe without the possibility of Marill fainting. It does this as well as any other Pokemon. Sing: Although unreliable, Sing is one of Marill's best ways to deal with incoming foes that would otherwise wall it. Eviolite: Marill really needs all of the stats it can get in order to successfully check the Pokemon it is meant to check. Choice Band: If Marill needs to revenge kill a Water-weak foe, a Choice Band makes Aqua Jet slightly more reliable. Red Card: Red Card can be used to phaze a dangerous sweeper, especially when combined with Endure. If you happen to be drafting a Marill and are considering making it a Tera Captain, consider this: no. Marill is used to supplement a completed draft because it shouldn't be coming to most games. Fire- and Ice-weak Teammates: Marill can be appealing as a final pick if the draft struggles against strong Fire- and Ice-type Pokemon. It really should not be the only Water-type on a draft, but faster ones like Greninja or those with secondary typings like Empoleon and Swampert may lead to teams with defensive gaps that Marill can help out with. Most Pokemon: Marill can't do much to the foes that it isn't tailored to deal with, so it is often forced to switch out or face a KO. This also leads to it taking significant damage from entry hazards because it can't afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots."

    "text": "Boasting the incredibly strong Technician Population Bomb along with the ability to set up and remove hazards in a single turn, Maushold stands out as one of the most threatening setup sweepers in the metagame. Due to its ability to outspeed and OHKO the majority of the tier after a single turn of boosting, it is imperative for every non-hyper offense team to have an answer to Maushold. Unfortunately for Maushold, this can be done incredibly easily by having any decently defensive Pokemon hold Rocky Helmet, as the multihit nature of Population Bomb simultaneously serves as its greatest strength and its Achilles' heel. Maushold's relative frailty also means that it can be easily dealt with by strong priority users and bulkier Pokemon that are able to survive a hit and KO it back. Tidy Up offers incredible utility, as it allows Maushold to set up and unpreventably remove hazards in a single slot. Bite is a go-to coverage option, as it allows Maushold to hit Ghost-types like Basculegion-F and Hisuian Zoroark. Bullet Seed is an alternative that can similarly hit the aforementioned Ghost-types as well as Rocky Helmet Hippowdon, which is one of Maushold's most common checks, at the cost of fizzling against Gengar. Encore can provide Maushold with free turns by locking an opponent into a useless move, which can often be game-winning due to Maushold's unrivaled power. Low Kick is another coverage option that enables Maushold to deal with bulky Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra, Registeel, and Eviolite Bisharp. Wide Lens is crucial for Maushold to improve Population Bomb's consistency, as otherwise it only has an approximate 35% chance to hit 10 times. Technician boosts all of Population Bomb, Bite, and Bullet Seed, enabling Maushold to be incredibly threatening despite its low Attack stat. Tera Ghost provides Maushold with valuable immunities to Fighting and Normal and a resistance to Bug, which can prevent it from getting revenge killed by Fighting-type attacks, including Body Press from Chesnaught and Close Combat from Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos, as well as priority attacks such as Conkeldurr's Mach Punch, Entei's Extreme Speed, and Slither Wing's First Impression. This can be capitalized on with Encore to give Maushold incredibly valuable free turns to set up. Tera Normal can be used instead to boost Population Bomb's power, which allows Maushold to OHKO bulky Pokemon like Fezandipiti and specially defensive Umbreon without needing to set up. Maushold fits best on offense, particularly hyper offense, structures, primarily due its ability to remove hazards despite already being an incredibly powerful setup sweeper. Becase of this, it synergizes with other setup sweepers like Throat Spray Yanmega and Lum Berry Salamence that are weak to Stealth Rock. While Maushold can be easily punished with physical walls holding Rocky Helmet such as Hippowdon, Galarian Weezing, and Chesnaught, it can often deal massive amounts of damage to them before fainting, which can give other physically offensive setup sweepers such as Revavroom and Mimikyu the wiggle room to pull off a sweep later in the game. Maushold particularly benefits from specially offensive teammates like Armarouge and Thundurus that can exploit any of the aforementioned physical walls hoping to get rid of Maushold. On generally offensive structures, Maushold can act as the primary setup sweeper and therefore greatly appreciates Knock Off support from Pokemon like Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos to remove Rocky Helmet from opposing physical walls. Maushold's greatest weakness, contact effects, can be neutralized with Protective Pads, albeit at the cost of drastically decreasing Population Bomb's reliability. Loaded Dice is an alternative to Wide Lens that improves Bullet Seed's reliability while still guaranteeing at least 4 hits with Population Bomb. Tera Fire can be used to prevent Maushold from getting burned by Will-O-Wisp Galarian Weezing and Talonflame and grant it free turns to set up against them. Contact Effects: Any of the physical walls in the tier, including Hippowdon, Chesnaught, Galarian Weezing, and Slowbro, can eliminate Maushold with the help of Rocky Helmet, with the interaction causing Maushold to faint after hitting just 6 times from full health. Pokemon such as Static Bellibolt and Flame Body Talonflame can also be used to cripple, instead of outright KO, Maushold at a very high probability as punishment for clicking Population Bomb; although they are less reliable, they have an edge over the other physical walls, as their anti-Maushold weapon cannot be neutralized with Knock Off. Faster Wallbreakers: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Barraskewda and Choice Scarf users such as Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao can revenge kill an unboosted Maushold, though the latter two have to be wary of a possible Tera Ghost from Maushold that could flip the game in its favor in a single turn. Steel-type Wallbreakers: Powerful Steel-types such as Hisuian Goodra and Choice Specs Magnezone can survive a hit from Maushold and KO it back. Hisuian Goodra in particular can temporarily cripple Maushold with Gooey and therefore allow its teammates to deal with it even if Maushold has accrued several Tidy Up boosts. Mimikyu: In the hyper offense mirror matchup, Mimikyu is one of the only Pokemon that can consistently deal with Maushold thanks to its immunity to Population Bomb. Mimikyu does, however, need to be wary of Bite that can take it out with enough flinches and Bullet Seed that can potentially KO Mimikyu past Disguise after Maushold gets one or two Attack boosts."

Hyper Voice is preferred, as it is stronger, but Tera Blast allows Meloetta to use Terastallization to flip matchups versus targets that typically comfortably switch into its Normal STAB move such as Copperajah with Tera Fighting while still being a functional Normal-type STAB move before Terastallizing. Psyshock is preferred, as it allows Meloetta to put pressure on Calm Mind users such as Florges and 3HKO Assault Vest Copperajah, which otherwise walls non-Focus Blast Meloetta. On the other hand, Psychic allows Meloetta to deal more damage to physically defensive targets such as Gligar and Bellibolt. Shadow Ball hits Galarian Slowbro and Bronzong while OHKOing Decidueye after Stealth Rock and also takes advantage of Serene Grace to put more pressure on foes with Special Defense drops. Focus Blast nails Scrafty and Wo-Chien, OHKOes Alolan Sandslash, and puts huge dents in checks like Copperajah, Naclstack, and Coalossal at the cost of inconsistency. If Meloetta opts for Focus Blast, Hyper Voice should be used as its Normal-type STAB move. Alluring Voice is an alternative that outright OHKOes Scrafty and Bombirdier while still 2HKOing Wo-Chien. Tera Ghost lets Meloetta 2HKO Alolan Sandslash and OHKO Houndstone with Shadow Ball while preventing it from being revenge killed by Arcanine's Extreme Speed and allowing it to spinblock versus checks like Coalossal and the aforementioned Alolan Sandslash, though making it susceptible to Decidueye's Shadow Sneak. Tera Normal boosts the power of Hyper Voice, 2HKOing Florges and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro while also making Meloetta less susceptible to being revenge killed by Sucker Punch from Skuntank and Bombirdier. Tera Fighting also helps versus Sucker Punch users and lets Meloetta function as an emergency check to +1 Scrafty and should be used in conjunction with Tera Blast to allow Meloetta to take on checks such as Copperajah and Alolan Sandslash, though it could also be used with Focus Blast to outright OHKO checks such as Coalossal and Assault Vest Copperajah; however, this is usually less useful than Tera Ghost or Normal on Focus Blast variants. Meloetta's potent wallbreaking capabilities make it a strong pick on bulky offense teams. Bellibolt is a good partner, as it can take on Skuntank and Bombirdier for Meloetta while being able to pivot to generate opportunities for Meloetta; in return, Meloetta's natural special bulk allows it to take on threats such as Toxtricity and Hoopa. Other pivots such as Scyther and Flamigo are also appreciated, as they force in targets such as Bellibolt, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone, which Meloetta can exploit while also matching up well into offensive threats to Meloetta such as Scrafty and Paldean Tauros-W and some defensive answers such as Wo-Chien. Meloetta's natural bulk facilitates wallbreaking opportunities; to utilize this effectively, entry hazards should ideally be off its side of the field, so teammates such as Alolan Sandslash and Coalossal are appreciated. Arcanine is a good partner, as it appreciates Meloetta's ability to weaken shared checks such as Coalossal to facilitate it sweeping late-game; in return, Arcanine can take on physical threats such as Scrafty and Decidueye, which could otherwise use Meloetta as setup fodder, depending on which move it is locked into. Choice Scarf Staraptor is a partner that appreciates Meloetta overwhelming foes such as Bronzong, Copperajah, and Coalossal, allowing Staraptor to use Brave Bird or Double-Edge more freely; in return, Staraptor revenge kills faster threats to Meloetta such as Paldean Tauros-W and Choice Scarf Flamigo. Sample set. Stay tuned for updates!"

  "Meowscarada": {
    "name": "Meowscarada",
    "text": "Meowscarada is one of the tier's premier offensive pivots thanks to its stupendous base 123 Speed, a critical benchmark that lets it outspeed scary threats like Cinderace, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Serperior. Knock Off scares some of the tier's key dangers like Deoxys-Speed, Dragapult, and Gholdengo while simultaneously threatening to cripple other switch-ins like Hatterene and Corviknight. Flower Trick cuts through bulky threats such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Primarina, even ignoring the former two's potential Defense boosts, while Triple Axel gives Meowscarada a crucial Ice-type STAB move that allows it to nail common Pokemon such as Clodsire, Gliscor, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon. U-turn could be used in the last slot for keeping momentum while chipping switch-ins such as Kingambit and Hatterene. Alternatively, Meowscarada can run Low Kick to smack Kingambit. Heavy-Duty Boots is practically a requirement on this set, as Meowscarada will frequently be switching in and out of combat and is otherwise quite weak to hazards. Tera Grass and Dark enhance Flower Trick and Knock Off while Tera Fire grants Meowscarada some crucial resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Steel-type attacks such as those from Enamorus, Darkrai, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Tera Electric is an additional option that allows Meowscarada to feast on Zapdos more effectively thanks to a newly gained Static immunity and resistance to both of its STAB moves. Meowscarada fits best on balance teams that need a way to force hazard chip along with Knock Off spam to whittle down or outright threaten Pokemon that otherwise don't mind Knock Off such as Gliscor. Meowscarada's frailty courtesy of its pitiful bulk is sometimes hard to work around and limits its switch in opportunities, especially with common weaknesses courtesy of its exploitable defensive typing and a nasty 4x weakness to U-turn. Furthermore, Meowscarada, while being quite fast, is still outsped by monsters such as Darkrai, Dragapult, Weavile, and Zamazenta, the latter of which happens to be one of Meowscarada's best checks. Weavile's offensive tenacity combined with deadly Speed makes it a potent threat, which is why Rocky Helmet Skarmory is one of Meowscarada's best partner options on balance teams, as it punishes Triple Axel spam and shrugs off Weavile's hits comparatively easily. Meowscarada's role as an offensive pivot helps chip away at opposing cores while also bringing some of their key defensive threats into OHKO range for some frail teammates like Darkrai, Iron Boulder, and Gholdengo. Dragapult is another great partner for Meowscarada; it can blank Fighting-type attacks and follow up with a fast Will-O-Wisp to neuter Zamazenta as well. Meowscarada's defensive woes can be covered by bulky teammates that don't mind taking coverage moves from faster threats. On the physical side, Great Tusk's role as a physically bulky offensive spinner with synergistic typing opens up multiple opportunities to clear hazards. On the special side, Clodsire and Galarian Slowking are both impressive partners thanks to their longevity and fantastic defensive profiles, with the former being able to blank setup sweepers like Darkrai and the latter being able to continue Meowscarada's momentum chain by using a slow Chilly Reception to take a hit or scout a switch, allowing Meowscarada to come in safely. Additionally, Galarian Slowking also threatens Pokemon that would commonly switch into Meowscarada like Iron Defense Zamazenta with Future Sight. Choice Item Meowscarada distinguishes itself as an amazing wallbreaker and offensive pivot of the tier thanks to its great Attack and Speed stats and fantastic coverage options alongside Protean, capable of dismantling common defensive picks such as Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Ting-Lu. Choice Band boosts its wallbreaking prowess to nuclear levels, whereas Choice Scarf makes it a great revenge killer capable of outspeeding foes like +1 Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and +1 Roaring Moon. Triple Axel functions as an incredible coverage move, hitting foes like Gliscor, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Enamorus super effectively. U-turn allows Meowscarada to gain momentum against common switch-ins like Kingambit, Skarmory, and Corviknight. Trick can also be used over Flower Trick to cripple checks like Skarmory and bulky setup sweepers like Hatterene to hamper their effectiveness and giving Meowscarada more flexibility with moves. Tera Dark boosts the power of its Knock Off, notably allowing Choice Scarf Meowscarada to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Choice Band Meowscarada to OHKO offensive Cinderace. Tera Fire makes Meowscarada resistant to Ice, Fairy, and Fire, helping it against foes like Darkrai, Enamorus, and Moltres while also making it immune to Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Dragapult and Moltres's Flame Body. In addition, Choice Scarf Meowscarada no longer OHKOes Gliscor, Roaring Moon, and Rillaboom, while Choice Band variants lose the OHKO on Raging Bolt. Finally, Tera Grass allows Meowscarada's Flower Trick to reach new heights of power, enabling Choice Scarf variants to secure an OHKO on bulky Calm Mind Primarina and Choice Band variants to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk. Choice Item Meowscarada fits well on bulky offense structures that appreciate its ability to pivot and remove items from opposing Pokemon, especially defensive ones, with Knock Off. Teammates such as Gholdengo appreciate Meowscarada pivoting against switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight, giving them opportunities to set up and clean. Other setup sweepers like Iron Defense Zamazenta also appreciate Meowscarada's ability to revenge kill foes like Gholdengo and non-Choice Scarf Enamorus for them to set up and sweep with minimum hindrance. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Gliscor also appreciate Meowscarada using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes foes like Moltres and Zapdos take hazard damage. Special wallbreakers like Enamorus and Raging Bolt also appreciate Meowscarada threatening special walls like Primarina and Galarian Slowking. Meowscarada struggles against Steel-types like Skarmory and Kingambit. Thus, teammates that threaten them, such as Dragapult and the aforementioned Gholdengo for Skarmory, and Pokemon like Zamazenta and Great Tusk for Kingambit, are appreciated. Zamazenta itself is also a threat to Meowscarada, so teammates that check it such as the aforementioned Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Enamorus should be acknowledged. Galarian Slowking also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Future Sight has excellent synergy with Meowscarada and helps it deal with Zamazenta as well as other Fighting-types like Iron Valiant by making Meowscarada's moves, especially Knock Off, harder to switch into with these Pokemon. In addition, it also forms a strong pivoting core with Meowscarada. Due to the risk of being Choice-locked into the wrong move, Meowscarada is also quite prediction reliant when facing structures with Pokemon like Gliscor and Dondozo. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure such cores, like Raging Bolt and Dragapult, are excellent partners. Meowscarada also doesn't like taking chip damage from hazards, as it repeatedly wants to pivot in and out of the field. Thus, it appreciates hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk."

  "Mesprit": {
    "name": "Mesprit",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Mesprit is a great revenge killer to handle fast Pokemon like Jolteon and Hisuian Sneasel. Dazzling Gleam is Mesprit's best complementary coverage move for Psychic, covering Dark-types like Sneasel and Sableye. U-turn lets Mesprit keep up offensive momentum against switch-ins like Orthworm, Farigiraf, and Snorlax. Healing Wish lets Mesprit give teammates like Virizion, Snorlax, and Glastrier a second chance to set up and sweep. Mesprit can alternatively use Trick to make a defensive Pokemon like Snorlax, Orthworm, or Dudunsparce less threatening. Tera Fairy Mesprit is a more effective offensive and defensive answer to Sneasel, Toxicroak, and Passimian given their Dark-type coverage moves, and Tera Fairy lets Mesprit not play guessing games with Psychic and Dazzling Gleam against Tera Dark Pokemon like the aforementioned Toxicroak and Passimian. Tera Steel has good synergy with Levitate and gives Mesprit several new resistances to more easily answer Whimsicott, Sandslash, and Farigiraf. Offensive pivots like Jolteon and Magneton make great cores with Mesprit and appreciate Mesprit's Levitate to more easily play around Ground-types. Fighting-types like Hisuian Decidueye, Virizion, and Passimian are great offensive checks to Steel-types like Orthworm and Perrserker and specially defensive Normal-types like Snorlax and Dudunsparce, all of which give Mesprit trouble, and they appreciate Mesprit offensively checking Poison-types like Toxicroak, Weezing, and Hisuian Sneasel. Mesprit benefits from Ground-type teammates like Sandslash and Sandaconda patching up its poor matchup against Hisuian Qwilfish, while it can check foes like Virizion and Hisuian Decidueye for them. Setup sweepers like Oricorio-G, Regirock, and Frosmoth benefit from Mesprit providing them second chances to sweep with Healing Wish or making foes more exploitable with Trick. Physical wallbreakers like Hisuian Decidueye, Glastrier, and Toxicroak all benefit from Healing Wish giving them an additional chance for breaking, as they can break special walls that Mesprit cannot. Nasty Plot Mesprit is a fearsome mid- or late-game sweeper thanks to the combination of Levitate and a somewhat high base 105 Special Attack stat. Its biggest perk is the ability to set up in front of most bulkier Pokémon. Mesprit can choose between Encore and Substitute as its setup tool; Substitute can be very good versus bulkier teams, as Mesprit can tank a hit from most of the passive mons such as Regirock and Lanturn if not being hit super effectively, obtaining a free turn to either set up Nasty Plot or fire off an attack. Encore helps to circumvent Mesprit's passivity and can take advantage of checks that need to set up or use status moves like Haze to wall Mesprit, like Articuno for the Haze case, and Dudunsparce for the set up. Psyshock is great to deal with specially defensive Pokémon such as Snorlax and Calm Mind users, like Dudunsparce. Draining Kiss allows Mesprit to outlast Dark-type checks such as Spiritomb and Sneasel while healing in the process, Thunderbolt allows it to hit Water- and Flying-types such as Cramorant and Clawitzer. Tera Fairy lets Mesprit set up in front of the aforementioned Dark-types, grants immunity to Dragon Tail from Dipplin, Appletun, and Dudunsparce, and increases the power of Draining Kiss, letting Mesprit restore more HP on the aforementioned threats and making it even harder to take down. Tera Steel improves Mesprit's defensive capabilities, making it take neutral damage from Dark- and Ghost-type attacks and giving it a Bug resistance, while only being weak to Fighting- and Fire-type moves due to Levitate. Tera Electric boosts the power of Thunderbolt and removes all of Mesprit's weaknesses. Nasty Plot Sweeper Mesprit works well with specific entry hazard setters and Fighting-types. Hazard setters like Orthworm and Hisuian Qwilfish both cover each other's weaknesses and let Mesprit get rolls it wouldn't otherwise, such as KOing Honchkrow with Tera Fairy Draining Kiss after Stealth Rock chip damage. Fighting-types such as Scarf Passimian, Virizion, or Hitmonlee deserve a highlight, as when paired with Mesprit, they provide good coverage for it, pressuring Dark- and Steel-types with their STAB moves and Ghost-types with Knock Off. Each of them offers additional utility, with Virizion being bulky enough to enter in and provide wallbreaking prowess, Passimian having access to U-turn to let Mesprit in safely and Knock Off to offer utility, and Hitmonlee providing support with Knock Off and Rapid Spin. Secondary wallbreakers that don't rely on Setup to make progress such as Clawitzer and Magneton will also appreciate being by Mesprit's side. Some cleaners also enjoy Mesprit's ability to make progress so they can clean late-game, such as Dodrio and Hisuian Sneasel."

  "Metagross": {
    "name": "Metagross",
    "text": "Metagross's great typing, stats, and movepool allow it to function as a solid bulky attacker, handling threats like Latios and Ogerpon-C. Heavy Slam is a reliable STAB move, taking advantage of Metagross's large weight to do solid damage to threats like Hydrapple, Mandibuzz, and Greninja. Stealth Rock also allows Metagross to function as an entry hazard setter, while Bullet Punch gives Metagross a STAB priority move to circumvent its below average Speed, hitting foes like Ogerpon-C and Mamoswine. Knock Off can be used to cripple checks like Slowking and Zapdos by removing their items, while Earthquake can be used to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill and Cobalion. Leftovers is crucial for maintaining Metagross's longevity, since it doesn't get a recovery move. 96 Speed EVs allow Metagross to outspeed maximum Speed Adamant Azumarill. Tera Dark allows Metagross to turn its weaknesses to Dark and Ghost into resistances while also boosting the power of its Knock Off, while Tera Water allows it to resist Fire-type attacks from Hisuian Arcanine and Skeledirge and tank Belly Drum Azumarill's boosted Aqua Jet. Metagross does best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate its good mix of power and bulk. Teammates like Zapdos, Mandibuzz, and Hydrapple all provide a Ground resistance that covers Metagross's weakness. In return, Metagross answers Ogerpon-C, which is scary for the former two and takes pressure off of Hydrapple. However, it is important to note that Zapdos and Tornadus-T cannot switch into Rhyperior safely, so answers to it like Slowking or the aforementioned Hydrapple are appreciated. Metagross is also weak to Fire-type moves from Pokemon like Hisuian Arcanine and Skeledirge, so Water types like Rotom-W and Slowking can help tank these attacks, both of which can use pivot moves to bring Metagross in safely. In general, Metagross benefits greatly from pivots that can bring it in safely, so U-turn users like Lokix, Tornadus-T, and Scizor also make great teammates. Metagross tends to struggle with bulky Flying-types like Zapdos and Mandibuzz, so it benefits from teammates that can handle these two, such as Rhyperior and Sandy Shocks. These two Pokemon also act as alternate Stealth Rock users, which not only synergizes well with Metagross's Knock Off but also allows it to run Bullet Punch. The latter can also act as a spiker to form a hazard-stacking core with Metagross. Explosion Metagross is an offensive Pokemon with some defensive utility and a simple gameplan: set Stealth Rock then use Explosion. Explosion does a lot of damage to the tier's defensive Pokemon like Hydrapple and Slowking. Earthquake lets it hit the Steel-types that resist its Explosion and Heavy Slam, like Empoleon and Excadrill. Stealth Rock gives it excellent utility, setting entry hazards while the foe switches out. Bullet Punch is useful when running an alternative hazard setter, as it can clean up foes at low HP. Metagross can utilize its fantastic typing to defensively check Pokemon like Latios and Hydrapple. Custap Berry alleviates how low Metagross may get in the process by gaining priority on Explosion. Normal Gem can allow it to KO some important targets, such as maximum Defense Hydrapple after Tera Normal. The given Speed investment allows Metagross to outspeed Mandibuzz, Azumarill, and Ursaluna, but 196 Speed EVs can allow it to outspeed targets like Tinkaton and Choice Band Tyranitar; however, doing so would sacrifice some of the bulk that lets it check Ogerpon-C and Latios. Tera Normal lets Metagross power up its Explosion, letting it OHKO Zapdos and favours it to KO Hydrapple with chip, but beware that most of its defensive utility comes from its typing, so only use Tera if Metagross needs Tera Normal to KO the foe. Metagross fits best on offensive structures, as it lures in Zapdos and Hydrapple and weakens them for the rest of the team to exploit. Excadrill is an amazing partner, especially considering how much it threatens Skeledirge and Rotom-W, Pokemon that Metagross hates. Thundurus and Sandy Shocks also are good partners, as they enjoy Metagross's ability to switch into Latios and weaken Hydrapple. Sandy Shocks can also act as an alternate Stealth Rock setter. Metagross also enjoys Sticky Web support from Araquanid, allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Tyranitar and Tinkaton while keeping its bulk as well as offensive checks like non-Heavy-Duty Boots Mamoswine and most Okidogi sets. Okidogi is another good partner, as it is great at keeping Lokix in check and uses it as a setup opportunity. Ghost-type Pokemon like Sinistcha and Pecharunt can cause problems, as they block Metagross's Explosion attempts while threatening it with Shadow Ball, so it appreciates offensive Dark-types like Tyranitar and Lokix."

  "Miasmaw": {
    "name": "Miasmaw",
    "text": "Miasmaw is a deadly physical sweeper, and it owes its success to its sky-high Attack stat, access to Scale Shot, and incredibly powerful ability in Neutralizing Gas. Together, these qualities allow it to circumvent common counterplay for sweepers such as Arghonaut and Pixilate Extreme Speed from Hemogoblin and allow it to easily decimate weakened teams after a single Swords Dance boost. Earthquake serves as Miasmaw's main coverage move, hitting Steel-types that would otherwise take little damage from Scale Shot such as Equilibra, Heatran, and Kingambit. Gunk Shot is the preferred option for the last moveslot, as it allows Miasmaw to dispatch otherwise bothersome Fairy-types such as Cresceidon, Iron Valiant, and Clefable that would attempt to block Scale Shot. However, if Miasmaw is backed by teammates that can deal with these Pokemon, it can instead choose to run Substitute to protect itself from priority moves and harmful status conditions. When used alongside Tera Ghost, it can also generate opportunities to turn Extreme Speed users such as Hemogoblin and Dragonite into setup fodder. Tera Blast can be run alongside Tera Fire to provide coverage against Skarmory and Corviknight, both of which Miasmaw otherwise struggles against. Loaded Dice is generally recommended to ensure that Scale Shot deals consistently strong damage. Tera Ghost prevents Miasmaw from being revenge killed by Extreme Speed from the likes of Hemogoblin and Dragonite while also allowing it to serve as a situational spinblocker. Alternatively, Tera Poison improves Miasmaw's matchups against Fairy-types by patching up its Fairy weakness and strengthening Gunk Shot, notably allowing it to OHKO Cresceidon and Clefable prior to using Swords Dance. Miasmaw finds itself at home on hyper offense teams. Its typing leaves it extremely vulnerable to entry hazards, so running it alongside hazard control such as Caribolt, Great Tusk, or Hatterene is mandatory. Miasmaw struggles to break through Skarmory and Corviknight if it does not have access to Tera Blast Fire, so it appreciates being paired with a Fire-type that can take advantage of these Pokemon such as Iron Moth or Hemogoblin. Other strong Dragon-type sweepers such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon work well with Miasmaw, as not only do they help wear down each other's checks, but they also heavily appreciate Miasmaw's ability to deal with Hemogoblin, which would otherwise stop these Pokemon dead in their tracks as they take massive damage from Pixilate Extreme Speed. Miasmaw's physical frailty and weakness to hazards mean that it may have trouble finding ample opportunities to set up during a game, and, as a result, it is a good idea to pair it alongside a Pokemon that can set dual screens or Aurora Veil, such as Alolan Ninetales or Deoxys-S. Special wallbreakers such as Stratagem, Chuggalong, and Deoxys-S pair well with Miasmaw, as they can deal with many of the physically bulky Pokemon that may give Miasmaw trouble; in return, Miasmaw demolishes any special walls that would otherwise prevent them from making progress. Finally, Miasmaw gets good value from Spikes to help wear down physical walls, so Pokemon that can set Spikes such as Hisuian Samurott, Deoxys-S, and Glimmora naturally make for good teammates. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used over Loaded Dice on teams without much entry hazard control, as it alleviates Miasmaw's weakness to hazards, but it makes Scale Shot far less consistent at dealing damage. Fire Fang is a usable alternative to Tera Blast Fire that gives Miasmaw access to Fire-type coverage without Terastallizing, but it is generally not recommended, as it deals significantly less damage. First Impression allows Miasmaw to double as a revenge killer, but it requires Miasmaw to give up valuable coverage and does next to nothing to help it perform its primary role as a sweeper. Entry Hazards: Miasmaw's typing leaves it very vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, which, in conjunction with its low physical bulk, greatly limit the number of opportunities it gets to set up. Skarmory and Corviknight: Unless Miasmaw is running Tera Blast Fire, it is countered by Skarmory and Corviknight, as they resist Scale Shot, are immune to Miasmaw's other coverage moves, and can offset any boosts Miasmaw gains from Swords Dance by using Iron Defense. However, these Pokemon take massive damage from the aforementioned Tera Blast Fire. Revenge Killers: If Miasmaw is unable to land a Scale Shot, its middling Speed leaves it very vulnerable to getting revenge killed by faster Pokemon such as Weavile and Dragapult. Even after using Scale Shot, Miasmaw must still be wary of Life Orb Deoxys-S, as it outspeeds and OHKOes Miasmaw with Psycho Boost after Stealth Rock damage. Similarly, Choice Scarf users such as Darkrai and Enamorus can take care of Miasmaw with Ice Beam and Moonblast, respectively, though the former requires that Miasmaw has taken prior damage, and the latter is not a common Pokemon in the tier. Priority: As Miasmaw is quite frail on the physical side, especially after having its Defense dropped from repeated uses of Scale Shot, it is extremely vulnerable to Sucker Punch from the likes of Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott. Similarly, Extreme Speed users such as Dragonite and Hemogoblin are perfectly capable of revenge killing Miasmaw, but this measure may prove ineffective should Miasmaw Terastallize into a Ghost-type. Physically Bulky Pokemon: Dondozo, despite having Unaware shut off by Neutralizing Gas, serves as a perfectly serviceable check for Miasmaw, as it takes minimal damage from Scale Shot and OHKOes Miasmaw in return with Avalanche. Arghonaut can switch in when Miasmaw sets up and forces it out with Circle Throw or cripples it with Knock Off. In a similar vein, Great Tusk usually avoids the OHKO from +2 Scale Shot and can easily finish Miasmaw off with Ice Spinner. Zamazenta takes little damage from Miasmaw's attacks after a boost from Iron Defense and deals significant damage with Heavy Slam or forces it out with Roar. However, these Pokemon need to be relatively healthy to safely deal with Miasmaw. Fast Status Spreaders: Cresceidon can switch in on the turn Miasmaw uses Swords Dance or Scale Shot and cripples it with Thunder Wave or Encore, or it can deal a large amount of damage with Moonblast, but it cannot deal with Miasmaw after it has set up, as it is OHKOed by +2 Gunk Shot. Dragapult can severely limit Miasmaw's effectiveness as a sweeper with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, or it can outright OHKO it with Dragon Darts. However, Dragapult cannot switch in directly, and it is unable to check Miasmaw at +1 Speed, since it is torn to shreds by Scale Shot."

  "Mienfoo": {
    "name": "Mienfoo",
    "text": "Mienfoo is an LC staple thanks to its combination of Speed, utility, and defensive resilience via its Fighting typing and Regenerator. High Jump Kick is the STAB move of choice, as its additional Base Power and lack of defensive stat drops make it a superior option to Close Combat. Knock Off allows Mienfoo to make consistent progress by removing the Eviolites of even Pokemon that check it like Foongus and Koffing. U-turn capitalizes on the switches Mienfoo forces and generates offensive momentum while synergizing with Regenerator recovery to keep Mienfoo healthy. Fake Out is useful priority that can wear down opposing sweepers and Choice Scarf users and chip foes into KO range. Taunt is another option that lets Mienfoo block Foongus's Spore and prevent setup. Maximum Speed is preferred to outrun major threats like Vullaby and Hisuian Growlithe. Tera Dragon gives Mienfoo a host of invaluable resistances, most notably to Hisuian Voltorb's STAB and Hisuian Growlithe's Flare Blitz, while Tera Fairy is a more niche pick that counters opposing Mienfoo. Mienfoo's utility and versatility mean it fits well on virtually any team, but it pairs especially well with Vullaby thanks to its ability to beat Vullaby's checks like Pawniard and Hisuian Growlithe. Vullaby also handles Foongus, especially if running Overcoat, which Mienfoo otherwise struggles to damage. Snubbull is a great teammate in matches where preserving Mienfoo's Eviolite is necessary, as it can easily switch into opposing Mienfoo's Knock Off and punish it with Thief. Mienfoo can do little to opposing Snubbull, so it appreciates teammates like Mudbray and Diglett-A that do not fear Snubbull's Thunder Wave and can threaten it out. Gastly and Stunky cannot reliably switch into Snubbull, but both threaten it with powerful Poison-type STAB moves off of Mienfoo's U-turn."

  "Mienshao": {
    "name": "Mienshao",
    "text": "Mienshao is the best offensive pivot in NU thanks to its high Attack stat, great Speed tier, and good coverage. Mienshao is able to threaten most of the tier with its STAB Close Combat, which enables it as a late-game sweeper. Its great Speed paired with Choice Scarf lets it outspeed unboosted Pokemon like Inteleon and Talonflame as well as boosted sweepers like Shell Smash Torterra and Dragon Dance Flygon. Knock Off punishes Mienshao's switch-ins like Galarian Slowbro, Dragalge, and Talonflame as well as Ghost-types that are immune to Close Combat like Chandelure and Brambleghast, while other coverage options like Stone Edge, Ice Spinner, and Poison Jab hit Flying- and Fairy-type switch-ins with super effective damage. On top of that, Regenerator pushes Mienshao above the competition, effectively letting it ignore entry hazards on the switch. Mienshao often plays into high-risk, high-reward scenarios; the threat of using Close Combat is high, as Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Talonflame, Galarian Slowbro, and Vileplume can all switch in and punish it with Flame Body, Rocky Helmet, and Effect Spore, respectively. Even with the risk of Rocky Helmet, Mienshao can still pivot with U-turn on predicted switches, giving it the upper hand. Mienshao's poor bulk is heavily expressed when facing priority users like Breloom and Basculegion as well as faster Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Munkidori. Choice Scarf boosts Mienshao's Speed to become a premier revenge killer, outspeeding the faster threats in the tier like Inteleon, Cinccino, and Kilowattrel. With passable bulk paired with Regenerator, Choice Scarf Mienshao is a great lead, achieving an OHKO or 2HKO against most entry hazard setters and Choice Scarf leads like Flygon and Staraptor. Knock Off punishes Ghost- and Psychic-types like Basculegion, Chandelure, and Galarian Slowbro that try to switch in on Close Combat, while U-turn gives Mienshao momentum through pivoting. Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel that want to punish Mienshao using Close Combat. Ice Spinner hits the previously mentioned Kilowattrel as well as Grass- and Dragon-types like Brambleghast, Tsareena, and Dragalge, but it's usually best to use U-turn against them to bring in a better check or generally keep up momentum and weaken them at the same time. Poison Jab can be used for Fairy-types like Sylveon and Florges; this is not preferred because it isn't strong and can be exploited by Steel-types like Registeel, Lucario, and Copperajah as well as other Poison-resistant Pokemon like Swampert, Flygon, and Dragalge. Regenerator gives Mienshao a lot of longevity that it normally wouldn't have with its other abilities, letting it switch in on weaker attacks and hazards without worrying about losing HP. Tera Fighting gives Mienshao's Close Combat a lot of extra power, allowing it to 2HKO Quagsire, Kilowattrel, and Diancie, as well as having a roll to 2HKO Swampert. Tera Dark boosts Knock Off's damage and defensively helps Mienshao against Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro, Cresselia, and Munkidori while gaining an immunity to Klefki's Thunder Wave. Mienshao appreciates being able to pivot into Pokemon that can take strong hits from Ghost-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types like Incineroar, Bombirdier, Dragalge, and Munkidori, all of which can pivot back into Mienshao if needed. Munkidori is most noteworthy because of its Toxic Chain ability, spreading Toxic on its U-turns to cripple Mienshao's Fairy- and Psychic-type checks like Sylveon, Florges, and Cresselia. This interaction can weaken the Close Combat switch-ins enough to enable Mienshao to freely click Close Combat later in the battle. Offensive threats that lure in Fairy-types like Breloom, Incineroar, and Tera Steel Flygon help at eliminating Mienshao's checks without weakening it or wasting Close Combat's PP. Choice Scarf variants of Munkidori and Infernape are often what will be used to revenge kill Mienshao; as such Cresselia is a good partner, resisting Munkidori's Psychic and being able to take on Infernape. Mienshao isn't weak to entry hazards thanks to Regenerator, but it is weak to teams that take advantage of it being Choice-locked. With that in mind, having a grounded Poison-type like Vileplume or Alolan Muk and a Defog user like Talonflame or Altaria really helps Mienshao stick around for longer, not having to rely so heavily on Regenerator. Pokemon that can take hits from Mienshao's hard switch-ins like Galarian Slowbro, Talonflame, and Vileplume are needed for its longevity, so Pokemon like Alolan Muk, Diancie, Swampert, and Copperajah all pair nicely with it. Mienshao can't do much to physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Vileplume, and Tera Poison Avalugg, so it enjoys partnering with a strong wallbreaker like Basculegion or better yet with a special attacking one like Chandelure or Toxtricity. These wallbreakers appreciate Mienshao KOing faster Pokemon like Inteleon, Kilowattrel, and Flygon. Chandelure can also switch into Choice Scarf Infernape's Close Combat, preserving some momentum. Life Orb boosts Mienshao's power a lot with little drawback thanks to Regenerator, giving it the opportunity to 2HKO Quagsire as well as OHKO Tsareena after some prior damage. Close Combat and Knock Off make a nearly unresisted combination; the latter enables Mienshao to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types that switch in on Close Combat like Chandelure, Brambleghast, and Galarian Slowbro. Close Combat and Knock Off synergize better with Life Orb than Choice Scarf thanks to Mienshao not being locked into one move, giving it a better fighting chance against Psychic- and Ghost-type switch-ins. U-turn retains Mienshao's strong pivoting capability without forcing it to lock into a single move. Stone Edge lets Mienshao take care of Talonflame and Kilowattrel on switch-in. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types like Sylveon and Florges. Fake Out allows Mienshao to revenge kill faster, weaker threats like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Swift Swim Kingdra. Swords Dance boosts Mienshao's already high Attack, giving it more of a chance to break past physical walls like Galarian Slowbro, Swampert, and Vileplume. Regenerator gives Mienshao more opportunities to wallbreak while not caring too much about damage from entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, and Life Orb. Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat to absurd levels, but Tera Poison boosts Poison Jab's damage, allowing it to OHKO Tsareena and Florges after a Swords Dance boost. Tera Ghost gives Mienshao many immunities to moves to revenge killers like Close Combat from Infernape and Mach Punch from Breloom; however, it becomes weak to Toxicroak's and Brute Bonnet's Sucker Punch. Swords Dance Mienshao appreciates entry hazard support from Swampert, Diancie, Klefki, and Dragalge to guarantee some KOs it otherwise would not obtain. Toxic Spikes in particular help to break through physical walls like Swampert and Sylveon, which cannot afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots. Faster Pokemon like Talonflame, Inteleon, and Kilowattrel can revenge kill Mienshao, which opens up room for various different walls like Diancie, Milotic, Registeel, and Alolan Muk to be paired alongside it. Choice Scarf users like Staraptor, Flygon, and Basculegion can all work to KO Pokemon that try to use their higher Speed to force Mienshao to switch. Slow pivots like Dragalge, Swampert, and Eject Button Galarian Slowbro can all safely bring in Mienshao. If running U-turn, Dark-types like Bombirdier, Alolan Muk, and Incineroar can all be brought in safely on a predicted Psychic-type move from Indeedee, Meloetta, or Munkidori. A status absorber, especially one that can absorb burns, is very useful to keep Mienshao healthy enough to wallbreak at any time; thus, it naturally pairs well with Milotic, Rest Alolan Muk, and Talonflame. Mienshao can use Choice Band to take advantage of its high Attack stat; however, it opens up more opportunities for your opponent to revenge kill Mienshao. Lastly, Triple Axel can be used over Ice Spinner for a stronger Ice-type move, but it is less reliable. Protective Pads lets Mienshao avoid adverse affects for its contact moves like Rocky Helmet, Flame Body, and Effect Spore but provides little else. Assault Vest is another option on the wallbreaker set, giving Mienshao more longevity against special wallbreakers and revenge killers like Diancie and Porygon-Z. Flying-types: Pokemon like Talonflame and Kilowattrel outspeed non-Choice Scarf Mienshao, can switch into Close Combat, and threaten an OHKO with Brave Bird and Hurricane, respectively. Talonflame is also able to punish Mienshao thanks to Flame Body having a chance to burn. Oricorio-E is freely able to set up against a Choice-locked Mienshao, but it is 2HKOed by Tera Fighting Close Combat unless it runs a very bulky EV spread. Ghost-types: Chandelure, Basculegion, and Brambleghast can safely switch in against Choice Scarf Mienshao that is locked into Close Combat and threaten it with an OHKO, but they all have to take caution against Knock Off and the possibility of Mienshao not running Choice Scarf, except Choice Scarf Chandelure and Basculegion. Poison-types: Vileplume and Galarian Slowbro wall Mienshao thanks to adverse damage over time through Rocky Helmet, Toxic, and recovery; the former can also restore all of its HP while simultaneously making Mienshao weaker with Strength Sap. Munkidori resists Close Combat and is naturally faster than Mienshao, often forcing it out by bluffing Choice Scarf. Psychic-types: Cresselia and Galarian Slowbro resist Mienshao's Close Combat and can force awkward predictions even while they are not on the field. They are both weak to Knock Off, but they can take the hit with the use of Terastallization and then use Mienshao as setup fodder. Physical Walls: Blanket physical walls such as Slowbro, Avalugg, and Quagsire can make it hard for Mienshao to break through bulkier teams, as they can recover their HP easily and Terastallize if needed. Bulky Fairy-types like Sylveon and Florges resist most of Mienshao's moves, being able to exploit non-Poison Jab variants. Priority Users: Tera Fighting Breloom as well as Aqua Jet Basculegion both possess strong priority to revenge kill Mienshao, often forcing it to switch out or Terastallize in situations it wouldn't want to. Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf Mienshao doesn't have this issue as much as the wallbreaker set, but Choice Scarf users like Munkidori and Infernape as well as Basculegion under rain will always outspeed Mienshao, giving them the opportunity to revenge kill it. Life Orb Mienshao is also outsped by Espeon, Kilowattrel, and Inteleon, all of which threaten it with a KO."

  "Mimikyu": {
    "name": "Mimikyu",
    "text": "Mimikyu holds an interesting place in the tier, as its excellent ability and good STAB combination help gear it towards offensive structures as a revenge killer and late-game cleaner. Disguise gives Mimikyu a free turn that it can use to reliably set up Swords Dance. Disguise can also be used to revenge kill opposing Pokemon or force them out with Red Card, making Mimikyu a rather consistent answer to setup sweepers. Mimikyu is mainly held back by its mediocre stats; a low base Attack for its role leaves Mimikyu really struggling to break through some bulky Pokemon even at +2 like Hippowdon and Galarian Weezing. Most of its defensive utility comes from its ability, so setting up Swords Dance can be difficult with its low base HP after Disguise is broken. Its mediocre Speed and frailty make it really easy to revenge kill by key threats in the tier like Hisuian Zoroark, Galarian Zapdos, and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Swords Dance Mimikyu occupies a unique place in the metagame as a setup sweeper and late-game cleaner that is used primarily because of the utility provided by its ability, Disguise, rather than purely because of its firepower. Since there are no viable Mold Breaker Pokemon in the tier, Disguise almost always guarantees Mimikyu a free turn to set up Swords Dance, which is incredibly valuable. Life Orb provides Mimikyu with much-needed extra firepower that can come in handy when attempting to dispatch offensive threats such as Galarian Zapdos and Kleavor or sweep after a Swords Dance. Red Card is an alternative that offers insurance by phazing out bulkier threats and setup sweepers that Mimikyu may not be able to easily take out such as Calm Mind Fezandipiti, Shift Gear Revavroom, and Throat Spray Yanmega; it also has the added possibility of bringing in a Pokemon like Cyclizar or Slither Wing that Mimikyu could use as setup fodder, in return for decreasing its damage. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed ensures that Mimikyu can outspeed a large chunk of the tier and, in particular, Kleavor and Krookodile. Tera Ghost strengthens Mimikyu's power as a sweeper and allows it to dish out heavy-hitting Shadow Sneak at +2, which can clean worn-down Pokemon like Noivern, Galarian Zapdos, and Gardevoir. Mimikyu fits best on hyper offense and offensive structures that rely on setup sweepers and strong attackers to overwhelm the opposing team and thus may not have the defensive resources necessary to easily take out a fast revenge killer or prevent a reverse sweep. Other notable setup sweepers such as Bisharp, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Shift Gear Revavroom pair well with Mimikyu by chunking holes in the opposing team and possibly removing some of its key defensive checks such as Hippowdon and Talonflame, thus bolstering Mimikyu's ability to clean late-game. Mimikyu can act as a decent spinblocker against teams reliant on Cyclizar for entry hazard removal. It also appreciates its own hazards support, thus pairing well with Stealth Rock leads such as Kleavor and Terrakion, as they ease Mimikyu's job as a cleaner by wearing out the opposing team, which brings them closer to KO range after a Swords Dance. Mimikyu synergizes well with Future Sight users such as Slowbro and Reuniclus, as it prevents some of Mimikyu's common Poison-type checks like Galarian Weezing and Fezandipiti from switching in. Status spreader partners such as Thunder Wave Thundurus and Will-O-Wisp Galarian Weezing can cripple offensive threats such as Armarouge, Kleavor, and Galarian Zapdos, which gives Mimikyu more opportunities to pull off a sweep. Wood Hammer helps Mimikyu break past physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Quagsire, but the recoil can greatly wear down Mimikyu, especially if it's holding Life Orb. Drain Punch helps against Steel-types that can take a hit from Mimikyu like Bisharp, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra while recovering any recoil from Life Orb. Physical Walls: Common physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Quagsire can tank hits from Mimikyu and wear it down with Rocky Helmet chip damage or cripple it with attacks or status. Poison-types: Poison-types like Amoonguss, Fezandipiti, and Galarian Weezing resist Mimikyu's Play Rough, forcing it to use its weaker STAB option in Shadow Claw, allowing the aforementioned Pokemon to recover off the damage and threaten back with their own attacks. Burn: Getting burnt from Talonflame's Flame Body, Galarian Weezing's Will-O-Wisp, or Slowbro's Scald can cripple Mimikyu's already mediocre damage output and make it pretty easy to take care of."

Red Card is an alternative that offers insurance by phazing out bulkier threats and setup sweepers that Mimikyu may not be able to easily take out such as Calm Mind Fezandipiti, Shift Gear Revavroom, and Throat Spray Yanmega; it also has the added possibility of bringing in a Pokemon like Cyclizar or Slither Wing that Mimikyu could use as setup fodder, in return for decreasing its damage. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed ensures that Mimikyu can outspeed a large chunk of the tier and, in particular, Kleavor and Krookodile. Tera Ghost strengthens Mimikyu's power as a sweeper and allows it to dish out heavy-hitting Shadow Sneak at +2, which can clean worn-down Pokemon like Noivern, Galarian Zapdos, and Gardevoir. Mimikyu fits best on hyper offense and offensive structures that rely on setup sweepers and strong attackers to overwhelm the opposing team and thus may not have the defensive resources necessary to easily take out a fast revenge killer or prevent a reverse sweep. Other notable setup sweepers such as Bisharp, Nasty Plot Thundurus, and Shift Gear Revavroom pair well with Mimikyu by chunking holes in the opposing team and possibly removing some of its key defensive checks such as Hippowdon and Talonflame, thus bolstering Mimikyu's ability to clean late-game. Mimikyu can act as a decent spinblocker against teams reliant on Cyclizar for entry hazard removal. It also appreciates its own hazards support, thus pairing well with Stealth Rock leads such as Kleavor and Terrakion, as they ease Mimikyu's job as a cleaner by wearing out the opposing team, which brings them closer to KO range after a Swords Dance. Mimikyu synergizes well with Future Sight users such as Slowbro and Reuniclus, as it prevents some of Mimikyu's common Poison-type checks like Galarian Weezing and Fezandipiti from switching in. Status spreader partners such as Thunder Wave Thundurus and Will-O-Wisp Galarian Weezing can cripple offensive threats such as Armarouge, Kleavor, and Galarian Zapdos, which gives Mimikyu more opportunities to pull off a sweep. Wood Hammer helps Mimikyu break past physically defensive walls like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Quagsire, but the recoil can greatly wear down Mimikyu, especially if it's holding Life Orb. Drain Punch helps against Steel-types that can take a hit from Mimikyu like Bisharp, Empoleon, and Hisuian Goodra while recovering any recoil from Life Orb. Physical Walls: Common physically defensive Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Quagsire can tank hits from Mimikyu and wear it down with Rocky Helmet chip damage or cripple it with attacks or status. Poison-types: Poison-types like Amoonguss, Fezandipiti, and Galarian Weezing resist Mimikyu's Play Rough, forcing it to use its weaker STAB option in Shadow Claw, allowing the aforementioned Pokemon to recover off the damage and threaten back with their own attacks. Burn: Getting burnt from Talonflame's Flame Body, Galarian Weezing's Will-O-Wisp, or Slowbro's Scald can cripple Mimikyu's already mediocre damage output and make it pretty easy to take care of."

    "text": "Minior is a colorful setup sweeper with its decent offensive stats, unrivaled Speed once boosted, and access to one of the best setup moves in the game: Shell Smash. Minior's unique ability can make it easier to set up with its Meteor forme's higher bulk and immunity to status moves, though it can be unreliable when trying to change to base forme and sweep. With Acrobatics and Earthquake having near-perfect neutral coverage, Stone Edge offers a secondary STAB move that hits foes that resist these moves such as Rotom-H and Kilowattrel as well as dealing more damage to certain walls like Altaria and Houndstone. Alternatively, Substitute helps Minior find turns to set up, makes it harder to revenge kill, and punishes moves like Sucker Punch from Skuntank and Bombirdier. 30 HP IVs activates Minior's Shields Down after two Substitutes, allowing it to be much more self-sufficient. An Adamant nature gives Minior an easier time sweeping, as once boosted and in its base forme, Minior outspeeds the entire metagame. However, a Jolly nature makes Minior slightly less reliant on setting up, since unboosted Adamant Minior's base forme Speed ties with base 105 Speed foes like Zoroark and Pawmot and is outsped by Pokemon like Salazzle, Virizion, and Whimsicott. Furthermore, a Jolly nature means its Meteor forme after a Shell Smash no longer Speed ties with Hisuian Electrode and isn't outsped by Choice Scarf users like Flamigo and Rotom-C. Tera Flying eases Minior's matchup against walls like Mudsdale and Milotic while sweeping and is preferred if not running Stone Edge for a stronger way to hit Altaria and Rotom-H. Tera Flying also allows Minior to tank certain priority moves like Pawmot's Mach Punch and Bruxish's Aqua Jet when at 50% HP. Alternatively, Tera Ground allows Minior to break through Flying-resistant foes such as Bellibolt, Hisuian Avalugg, and Duraludon. It can also give Minior chances to set up when baiting Electric- and Rock-type moves like Bellibolt's Volt Switch, Kilowattrel's Thunderbolt, and Coalossal's Power Gem. Both of these options come at the cost of Minior's resistance to priority moves like Staraptor's Quick Attack and Arcanine's Extreme Speed. Minior fits well on offensive teams as a secondary sweeper, since it lacks the raw strength needed to break healthy walls and often relies on having low HP to win. Defensive walls that can tank its boosted attacks like Mudsdale, Houndstone, and Bronzong should be worn down with their checks like Decidueye and Paldean Tauros-F and special wallbreakers like Toxtricity. If not running Stone Edge, Pokemon like Rotom-H and Kilowattrel can also tank a hit, so their own checks like Tatsugiri and Duraludon can come in handy. Pokemon like Rotom-C and Scyther can also lure in many of these walls in, and while they don't do much damage, they can eventually put these threats in range for Minior. The wide array of priority move users like Skuntank, Bombirdier, Hariyama, and Paldean Tauros-W should also be accounted for, especially if not running Substitute for the former two, as they easily KO Minior in its base forme, immediately putting a stop to its sweep. Encore and Trick users like Delphox, Calm Mind Scream Tail, and Rotom-C can help Minior come in safely and get an opportunity to set up. Offensive pivots like Decidueye and Kilowattrel can give Minior setup opportunities by luring in setup bait like Altaria and Gligar."

  "Miraidon": {
    "name": "Miraidon",
    "text": "Thanks to Miraidon's outstanding power cementing it as one of the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame, it is a staple on balance and bulky offense, and every team needs to have effective counterplay for it. U-turn makes Miraidon an amazing pivot, allowing it to safely bring in teammates such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S. However, due to the prevalence of the Ground-types Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground, which can force Miraidon out one-on-one, it has a tough time safely coming in and wallbreaking. Additionally, Calyrex-S and Choice Scarf Koraidon can revenge kill Miraidon. Keeping this in mind, Miraidon really appreciates teammates such as Ho-Oh and Ting-Lu that are able to check Ting-Lu, Arceus-Ground, and offensive wallbreakers such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S. Miraidon's raw natural power backed by Hadron Engine and access to U-turn make it one of the best pivots for balance and bulky offense teams. Heavy-Duty Boots greatly increases Miraidon's longevity by letting it come in multiple times without any consequences from entry hazards while also improving its matchup against Sticky Web. Taunt helps prevent Ting-Lu from using Spikes, Arceus formes and Clodsire from using Recover, and foes such as Arceus and Necrozma-DM from setting up. Calm Mind allows Miraidon to OHKO Necrozma-DM after a single boost and brute force its way through its checks, 2HKOing Ting-Lu and OHKOing Arceus-Ground at +1 after entry hazard damage. Solar Beam is an alternative option that allows Miraidon to 2HKO Ting-Lu and OHKO Arceus-Ground after some minor chip damage, although it requires sun to be up for Miraidon to be able to use it with ease. Tera Fairy gives Miraidon an immunity to Dragon-type moves from Koraidon, Eternatus, and opposing Miraidon, albeit at the cost of making it weak to Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and removing its resistance to Ho-Oh's STAB moves. Tera Dragon boosts Miraidon's Draco Meteor to absolutely insane levels, allowing it to 2HKO Ting-Lu at +1 and OHKO Arceus-Ground. Tera Ghost grants Miraidon an immunity to Koraidon's Low Kick and Arceus's Extreme Speed, although it makes Miraidon weak to Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Miraidon is primarily used on balance and bulky offense teams that benefit from its wallbreaking and pivoting capabilities. Miraidon struggles with revenge killers such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S, so it likes checks to them such as Ho-Oh and defensive Arceus formes for the former and Ting-Lu for the latter. Miraidon appreciates being paired with Choice Scarf Koraidon, as they can pivot each other in and complement each other really well, with Koraidon being able to pressure Ting-Lu and Arceus-Ground and Miraidon helping against Ho-Oh and Arceus-Water. Miraidon also appreciates special attackers such as Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground that can pressure and eventually break through Ting-Lu. Lastly, Miraidon greatly benefits from Ting-Lu setting entry hazards to let it effectively break through foes and being a fabulous check to Calyrex-S and Arceus-Ground, which Miraidon struggles with. Miraidon can opt to use a more niche option in Overheat, which OHKOes Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C under the sun provided by the omnipresent Koraidon. However, it is heavily prediction reliant and makes Miraidon drop more effective option in Taunt or Calm Mind. Miraidon can also opt for Tera Grass, which further bolsters the power of Solar Beam, allowing it to OHKO Ting-Lu at +1 and OHKO Arceus-Ground when unboosted. Furthermore, it lets Miraidon serve as a backup check to Arceus-Ground thanks to the Ground resistance it provides. Ting-Lu: Ting-Lu can effectively switch into Miraidon's Draco Meteor and safely pivot into Electro Drift, making it difficult to break through. However, Ting-Lu lacks recovery, which means it cannot do this repeatedly. Arceus-Ground: At +1, Arceus-Ground can outspeed Miraidon and threaten it out with Earthquake. Also, Arceus-Ground is able to pivot in on Miraidon's Electro Drift, and it can force Miraidon to switch out in a one-on-one situation. Revenge Killers: Revenge killers such as Koraidon and Calyrex-S can outspeed Miraidon and potentially KO it with their STAB moves. Additionally, thanks to Arceus's STAB priority in Extreme Speed, it can pick off a low-HP Miraidon. Zacian-C: Courtesy of Zacian-C's high Speed and Play Rough, it is able to KO Miraidon. Also, Zacian-C is one of the very few Pokemon that blocks Miraidon's Draco Meteor, making it easier for it to safely switch in."

  "Mollux": {
    "name": "Mollux",
    "text": "Mollux's typing combined with recovery and an excellent ability in Dry Skin allows it to be a premium check to a wide variety of threats such as Iron Valiant, Hemogoblin, and Ogerpon-W. Stealth Rock allows Mollux to be an entry hazard setter that discourages Equilibra from switching in to use Rapid Spin. Rapid Spin allows Mollux to serve as a spinner that threatens common spin-blockers like Gholdengo and Necturna. Clear Smog shuts down setup sweepers such as Chuggalong, Raging Bolt, and Hemogoblin. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be chosen instead, as the poison chance can cripple Ground-type switch-ins. In addition, the increased Base Power can force out Ogerpon-W. Tera Fairy allows Mollux to be useful against sun by pressuring Walking Wake with its immunities and improves its matchup against Kingambit and Dragapult. Tera Steel gives Mollux a Future Sight resistance, making it a useful switch-in against Galarian Slowking. In addition, it walls non-Flamethrower Chuggalong and resists Stored Power, allowing it to use Clear Smog in a pinch. Tera Flying allows Mollux to flip its matchup against Equilibra, grants an immunity to Spikes, and prevents Ogerpon-W from catching it off guard with Stomping Tantrum. The given EV spread allows Mollux to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and threaten it with a Lava Plume. The remaining EVs are invested in Special Defense to allow Mollux to better switch in against Krilowatt and Gholdengo. Mollux fits best on balance teams, where its role compression and ability to check a large number of threats are appreciated. Its 4x Ground weakness leaves it very vulnerable to threats such as Great Tusk and Gliscor, the latter of which also makes a good teammate thanks to its Ground immunity. Corviknight and Equilibra make excellent partners for similar reasons. In return, Mollux is a solid answer to Pokemon that threaten them such as Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake. Mollux's large weakness to entry hazards if Heavy-Duty Boots is Knocked Off can easily compromise its ability to serve as a spinner. Thus, either a secondary hazard remover such as Equilibra or Corviknight or a Knock Off switch-in such as Gliscor or Clefable is needed. Mollux cannot threaten Garganacl to any degree and is quickly worn down by Salt Cure or KOed by Earthquake. Thus, allies that can offensively pressure Garganacl such as Ogerpon-W and Gholdengo are appreciated. Mollux is unable to hit Heatran and is very vulnerable to being trapped by Magma Storm and KOed by Earth Power, so Pokemon that can threaten Heatran such as Cresceidon and Ogerpon-W are excellent allies. Mollux can struggle to check physical threats such as Roaring Moon and Miasmaw, so physical walls such as Cresceidon, Arghonaut, and Skarmory fit well as teammates. Arghonaut can also help Mollux deal with Chuggalong, specifically its Stored Power sets, which otherwise OHKO Mollux. Psychic-types such as Deoxys-S and Galarian Slowking greatly threaten Mollux. Pokemon that can check these foes such as Equilibra, Kingambit, and Ting-Lu make excellent teammates. Calm Mind can be used over Stealth Rock or Rapid Spin to ease the matchup against Substitute Iron Moth and Darkrai while turning Mollux into a potent late-game wincon once checks such as Heatran and Ting-Lu are removed; however, this takes away valuable utility. Thunder Wave can also be used as an option to cripple Chuggalong and unsuspecting physical threats such as Roaring Moon and Miasmaw looking for free setup, but Ground-types are immune to it and it makes Mollux even worse against them. Hydro Pump can be used when Mollux is employed on rain teams to threaten Ting-Lu and Garganacl, but the lack of accuracy can make Mollux more inconsistent, while the lack of PP worsens the matchup against balance teams. Ground-types and Pokemon with Ground-type Coverage: Great Tusk, Landorus-T, Equilibra, and Gliscor greatly threaten Mollux with their Ground-type STAB moves. Pokemon such as Miasmaw and Roaring Moon can produce similar pressure with Ground-type coverage. Pokemon that Mollux usually checks consistently, such as Hemogoblin, Krilowatt, and Ogerpon-W, can run surprise Ground-type coverage to deal with Mollux. Specially Defensive Pokemon: Garganacl and Heatran can switch into any move that Mollux can use and are both immune to the burns and poisons that it can threaten other checks with while threatening it with Salt Cure and Earth Power, respectively. Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu have to worry a bit more about Lava Plume's burn chance, but they take little damage from Mollux and can freely set up Future Sight and Spikes against it, respectively. Knock Off: Knock Off from Arghonaut and Ogerpon-W cripples Mollux by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, leaving it extremely vulnerable to entry hazards and jeopardizing its ability to check threats such as Darkrai and Krilowatt. Physical Attackers: Pokemon such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, Miasmaw, and Jolly Kingambit can easily wallbreak past Mollux's weaker Defense stat with little risk. Mollux can discourage setup with Clear Smog but otherwise is greatly threatened. Psychic-types: Deoxys-S can greatly threaten Mollux with Psycho Boost. Iron Crown can quickly wear Mollux down with Psychic Noise and deny recovery or easily 2HKO it with Psyshock. Weakness Policy sets can take advantage of Lava Plume and use Mollux to sweep. Sun: While Mollux can be useful against sun teams thanks to its ability to threaten Malaconda with a boosted Lava Plume and annoy Walking Wake with its Water immunity, the HP loss from Dry Skin is crippling and severely cuts Mollux's ability to check threats such as Raging Bolt and Hemogoblin."

  "Moltres": {
    "name": "Moltres",
    "text": "Moltres is an excellent defensive Pokemon, being able to function as a sturdy physical wall and a pivot. Its typing and ability let it punish a multitude of physical attackers in the tier, threatening a burn with Flame Body to stop pivoting from U-turn or reliably walling the likes of Zamazenta lacking Stone Edge, Great Tusk, Enamorus, Rillaboom, and Iron Valiant. Hurricane can be used to threaten foes like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W hard. Will-O-Wisp reliably cripples physical attackers like Terastallized Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, and Dragonite. Roar stops potential setup sweepers like Tera Fire Zamazenta and Iron Moth, as well as being a good way to deal passive damage if entry hazards are up. U-turn lets Moltres get in teammates safely. Scorching Sands can be used to hit foes like Heatran and Raging Bolt and can fish for burns against most physical attackers. Tera Fairy is a solid defensive typing that gives Moltres a Dark resistance while keeping its natural Fighting resistance, maintaining its positive matchup versus Zamazenta. This lets Moltres check Dark-type physical attacker like Weavile, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit in a pinch. Tera Grass flips Moltres's weakness to Water into a resistance, giving it an easier rain matchup, as well as taking various hits like Hydro Steam from Walking Wake, Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-W, and Water-type moves from Primarina to Roar out Calm Mind variants. It also flips Moltres's Electric weakness against Raging Bolt, letting it phaze Calm Mind variants with Roar. Terastallization allows Moltres to ease its weakness to Knock Off and Stealth Rock, letting it not fear huge chip damage from them. Moltres is a great fit on offensive teams and more bulky teams. Its great typing and its ability to spread burn help its teammates against prominent physical attackers. Partners like Clefable and Kingambit appreciate it being able to check threats like Great Tusk and opposing Kingambit, while Clefable and Kingambit are able to switch into threats to Moltres, such as Weavile and Roaring Moon. Offensive partners like Ogerpon-W and Zamazenta appreciate Moltres's pivoting, forcing in Pokemon like Garganacl and Heatran, which have bad matchups against the aforementioned teammates. Zamazenta is also able to check Ogerpon-W with its ability's initial Defense boost. Darkrai and Weavile are also potent offensive partners, being able to amend Moltres's bad matchups such as Gliscor and Galarian Slowking by threatening huge damage on both targets. Threats to Moltres are potent attackers such as Primarina and Ogerpon-W. A partner like Galarian Slowking works well with Moltres, as it enjoys burns allowing it to switch into physical attackers, such as a burned Zamazenta, as well as being able to switch into attacks from Primarina. Offensive threats like Ogerpon and Dragapult can check Ogerpon-W, either helping in taking attacks, revenge killing, or crippling it with status. Defensive partners such as Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Corviknight can switch into Knock Off for Moltres, with Gliscor itself being able to use Knock Off and set Spikes, which pairs well with Roar variants of Moltres. Great Tusk and Corviknight offer entry hazard removal. Ground-types like Clodsire and Ting-Lu are able to cover Moltres's bad matchups against Electric-types like Raging Bolt and Zapdos, as well as providing hazards, which make Moltres's phazing more of a threat."

  "Moltres-Galar": {
    "name": "Moltres-Galar",
    "text": "This analysis was uploaded prior to The Indigo Disk release and may contain outdated information. Galarian Moltres is a terrifying sweeper due to its access to both Nasty Plot and Agility as well as a near-unresisted STAB combination. After one Nasty Plot boost, it can 2HKO the likes of Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Curse Garganacl, and after one Agility boost, it can outspeed would-be faster Pokemon such as +1 Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and +1 Walking Wake. Tera Blast Fairy lets it OHKO Hoopa-U while also being able to net 2HKOs on Kingambit, Assault Vest Hoopa-U, and Dragonite, all after one Nasty Plot boost. Tera Fairy also maintains its Dark resistance while letting it potentially set up in the face of Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult. Alternatively, Hurricane is a strong neutral STAB move that prevents Galarian Moltres form relying too much on Terastallization to function. Tera Dark boosts Fiery Wrath's power, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Moltres and Assault Vest Toxapex after a Nasty Plot boost. Tera Flying is only to be used if running Hurricane, which can OHKO Zamazenta without a Nasty Plot boost, as well as non-Assault Vest Azumarill and Enamorus after a Nasty Plot boost. Sitrus Berry lets it set up much more easily, and can potentially let it trigger Berserk twice. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore Stealth Rock. Finally, Weakness Policy is a viable alternative if running dual screens support to take on super effective hits more comfortably. Because of its reliance on setup, Galarian Moltres is best utilized on hyper offense teams. Hence, it appreciates entry hazard support from suicide leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada so that incoming foes can be worn down for Galarian Moltres to clean. Dual screens from Dragapult lets it setup much more easily, esepcially for Weakness Policy variants. Hazard control is a must when running Galarian Moltres due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates partners such as Great Tusk and Hatterene with their access to Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce. The two of them can also threaten special walls that can hinder a Galarian Moltres sweep, with Great Tusk being able to OHKO Galarian Slowking and 2HKO Ting-Lu, while Hatterene can 2HKO Clodsire. In return, Galarian Moltres can set up on and threaten Zamazenta for Great Tusk and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo as well as special walls like Garganacl prevent Galarian Moltres from performing its sweep. Hence, offensive Zapdos pairs well with Galarian Moltres, being able to 2HKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon, provided Garganacl is Tera Water. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can facilitate sweeps from physically oriented sweepers like Kingambit by removing obstacles like Great Tusk and Gholdengo."

Heavy Slam hits Pokemon that are resistant to its other moves and is a 100% accurate, low-risk move against most of its switch-ins. Stone Edge allows it to hit common threats like Vullaby and Larvesta. Tera Steel helps defensively against common threats like Vullaby, Gothita, and Hisuian Voltorb, while offensively, it boosts the power of Heavy Slam. Tera Water helps defensively against common threats like Shellder and Hisuian Growlithe. Vullaby is a great teammate for Mudbray, as it checks Ground-resistant foes such as Toedscool and Grookey. In return, Mudbray threatens the Steel- and Rock-types such as Tinkatink, Glimmet, and Hisuian Growlithe that beat Vullaby. Another common teammate is Foongus, as it appreciates Mudbray's ability to beat Poison- and Steel-types like Stunky, Pawniard, and Tinkatink for it.

    "text": "With a great ability in Stamina and access to helpful utility moves such as Stealth Rock and Roar, Mudsdale cements itself as a helpful wall in PU that keeps physically offensive Pokemon like Paldean Tauros-F, Flamigo, Zoroark, Emboar, and Arcanine in check. Body Press lets Mudsdale put Stamina to good use, allowing it to get good damage off on Zoroark, Scrafty, and Tera Normal Arcanine. Heavy Slam, on the other hand, hits Flying-types neutrally while also letting Mudsdale hit Fairy-types that could otherwise easily set up in front of it like Scream Tail, Florges, and Grimmsnarl. However, Stone Edge hits Flying-types like Staraptor and Bombirdier super effectively while also threatening Rotom-H. Roar deters setup sweepers like Bulk Up Scrafty, Hariyama, and Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro before they get out of hand. Leftovers improves Mudsdale's longevity, while Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers like Staraptor and Scyther. Tera Water allows Mudsdale to take on Water-type wallbreakers like Paldean Tauros-W and Tatsugiri in a pinch, but it can no longer check Pawmot and Bellibolt as easily as before. On the other hand, Tera Steel grants Mudsdale the ability to check Fairy-types like Florges and Scream Tail, boosts Heavy Slam's damage output, and helps its matchup versus Galarian Articuno, Goodra, and Decidueye. However, this leaves Mudsdale open to being preyed on by Ground-, Fire-, and Fighting-types like Golurk, Arcanine, and Heracross, which it checked beforehand. When paired with a specially defensive Pokemon like Bronzong, Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, or Milotic, Mudsdale can form a strong defensive core that's quite difficult to break through. Mudsdale easily checks Fire- and Fighting-types like Arcanine, Emboar, and Flamigo, so Pokemon weak to those types like Rotom-C, Duraludon, and Scrafty can take advantage of its defensive capabilities. Mudsdale tends to falter against Water- and Grass-types like Tatsugiri, Decidueye, and Rotom-C, making partners that can take on these threats like Milotic, Wo-Chien, and Goodra strong defensive options. With Mudsdale's lack of reliable recovery, it greatly appreciates Wish support from Pokemon like Scream Tail and Florges to circumvent this issue. Entry hazards also highlight Mudsdale's lack of reliable recovery, so partners like Defog Altaria, Decidueye, and Rapid Spin Alolan Sandslash help work around this weakness."

Poison Touch along with Poison Jab allow it to spread poison nearly uninhibited, letting it chip away at opposing teams quite easily. However, Alolan Muk is quite frail physically, often being forced out by pivots like Mienshao and Flygon and losing momentum. It is also weak to fairly common Ground-types like Flygon and Swampert, which then get free turns to set entry hazards or boost their offensive stats. Also, its reliance on unreliable and passive forms of recovery can let it be overwhelmed and taken advantage of. Poison Jab is preferred for damage, but Poison Fang can be used to spread poison more easily. Rest + Sleep Talk offers recovery but is sometimes unreliable; alternatively, Drain Punch + Protect allows Alolan Muk to regain health while threatening Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel. Tera Water can be used to better take Fire-type attacks from Hisuian Typhlosion and Chandelure, and it gifts Alolan Muk a strong defensive Tera type that can take on tons of Pokemon well. However, Tera Dragon helps Alolan Muk check a wide array of special attackers like Inteleon, Oricorio-E, and Rotom-H better than Tera Water does. Both Tera Water and Dragon help Alolan Muk when facing Ground-types, but they tend to leave it more susceptible to other physical wallbreakers like Tsareena and Brambleghast. Alolan Muk fails against physical attackers, especially Ground- and Fighting-types such as Flygon, Breloom, and Mienshao. So, Pokemon like Vileplume, Talonflame, and Swampert help to form a strong defensive core for the team. After using Knock Off, Alolan Muk is almost helpless against Steel-types like Registeel and Klefki as they set entry hazards or boost; its Drain Punch is just too weak. To counter this, teammates that can handle these foes such as Infernape, Chandelure, and Flygon pair well with Alolan Muk. Since it can deal with Psychic- and Ghost-types easily, Pokemon such as Mienshao, Brambleghast, and Munkidori greatly appreciate Alolan Muk's presence. Because of how easily Alolan Muk can remove items, hazard setters like Klefki, Swampert, and Quagsire have great synergy with it. On the flip side, with how many times Alolan Muk is forced to switch into an attack, hazards become an issue for it, jeopardizing its ability to take on Chandelure and Munkidori. To clear these hazards, Pokemon like Talonflame, Avalugg, and Tsareena pair perfectly. A more offensive Alolan Muk with an Assault Vest and a moveset of Knock Off / Poison Jab / Drain Punch / and one of Ice Punch, Rock Slide, Giga Drain, or Shadow Sneak can be used to take special hits while also pressuring foes, but, in doing so, it sacrifices a lot of longevity. Alolan Muk could also run Clear Smog to counteract setup sweepers trying to take advantage of its passivity. Ground-types: Ground-type Pokemon like Swampert, Flygon, and Mudsdale easily deal great damage to Alolan Muk with a super effective Earthquake, and they can capitalize on a forced switch by setting Stealth Rock or boosting. Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Mienshao, Paldean Tauros-W, and Heracross, while not having a way to hit Alolan Muk super effectively, overwhelm it, taking advantage of its low Defense with their powerful Fighting-type attacks. Poison-types: Poison-types like Vileplume and Toxicroak can wall Alolan Muk due to their immunity to poison. On top of that, Vileplume is able to set up Leech Seed or use Growth, while Toxicroak freely sets up with Swords Dance and can do this repeatedly with Leftovers and Drain Punch. Physical Wallbreakers: Physical wallbreakers like Iron Thorns and Heracross easily overwhelm Alolan Muk with their Quark Drive- and Guts-boosted attacks due to its low Defense. Setup Pokemon: With how passive Alolan Muk can be, especially with Rest, it can be setup fodder for Pokemon like Drednaw, Incineroar, and Flygon."

  "Munchlax": {
    "name": "Munchlax",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1 point Overview: Compared to similarly-priced options, Munchlax has surprising bulk and a few very specific tools that make it a decent fit for certain types of teams but relatively useless for most others. It is a one-dimensional answer to special attackers that rely primarily on Ghost-, Fire-, and Ice-type attacks. As a bottom-tier option, Munchlax has many flaws, including its reliance on Eviolite, unhelpful typing, dependence on Rest to heal, and need for more than four moves to be effective in many matchups. Special Wall: Using Munchlax as a wall to specific threats allows it to run more coverage or disruption to deal with varying team compositions. Yawn can force switches or put foes to sleep, Encore can lock foes into a move to slow their progress, and super effective coverage can deal some chip damage to obvious switch-ins. Bulky Setup: Munchlax's bread-and-butter set involves Eviolite to maximize its bulk, Curse to boost its mediocre Attack and Defense, and RestTalk to stay healthy while continuing to set up while typically being reliant on either a STAB move or a weaker coverage option as its only attacking move. RestTalk can be replaced with more coverage, but it inevitably gets worn down without a way to heal. Primary STAB Moves: Body Slam, Double-Edge, Facade Setup Moves: Curse Utility Moves: Yawn, Encore, Rest, Sleep Talk, Substitute, Brick Break Coverage: Earthquake, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Crunch, Gunk Shot, Rock Slide, Seed Bomb, Zen Headbutt Counter: Munchlax can survive a strong physical attack due to its high HP and Eviolite and deal massive damage to non-Ghost-types in return with Counter. Rock Tomb / Bulldoze: Although Munchlax is unlikely to outspeed anything even after multiple Speed reductions, its teammates might benefit from slower foes on switch-in. This can also prevent a foe from setting up to sweep. Belly Drum: If Curse is too slow and Munchlax can find a passive foe to take advantage of, it can use Belly Drum with or without Gluttony and a pinch Berry to instantly become an offensive threat. Stockpile: If Munchlax needs additional Special Defense to check specific foes, Stockpile can allow it to take more hits both physically and specially at the cost of not boosting its Attack. Eviolite: Munchlax's bulk is amplified by Eviolite, allowing it to take more hits and give itself time to set up, deal damage, spread status, and heal itself. This necessary item provides massive value at no cost. Having Munchlax as a Tera Captain is almost never a good idea. If a draft somehow has literally no other better options, it can benefit from Tera Ghost and Poison to flip its weakness to Fighting and Tera Fire to help it avoid burns while hitting problematic Steel-types harder. Munchlax has a few very positive matchups while losing in the vast majority of others, so it should fit on teams that are already complete with entry hazard control, pivoting, offenses, and defenses. Its only other strength is potentially getting ignored by the opponent when teambuilding, allowing it space to set up or spread status to support its team. Fire-, Ghost-, and Ice-weak Teams: Teams that are weak to Fire, Ghost, or Ice appreciate Munchlax's bulk with Eviolite combined with Thick Fat, making it take comically low damage from prominent special attackers like Chi-Yu, Primarina, and Gengar and forcing foes like Heatran and Kyurem to run physical coverage. Fighting-resistant Pokemon: If a team has multiple teammates that resist or are immune to Fighting like Gholdengo, Landorus-T, and Latios before picking up Munchlax, opponents are much less likely to bring coverage specifically for a one-point Pokemon, which provides it more room to be useful. Physical Attackers: Even with Eviolite, Munchlax can struggle to take strong physical attacks before getting a chance to use Curse or Stockpile. Disruption / Phazing: Munchlax is relatively predictable and cannot do very much meaningful damage without setting up, so disruptive moves like Taunt, Encore, Roar, and Dragon Tail can nullify its effectiveness and make it much less impactful to games. These counters are easy to pull off as well due to its abysmal Speed. Chip Damage: Munchlax prefers to use Curse at least once before spending turns on Rest and Sleep Talk, so being forced to switch and take repeated damage from entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, and multiple attacks limits its effectiveness. Knock Off: Munchlax's usefulness is heavily reduced if it loses the additional bulk from Eviolite."

  "Munkidori": {
    "name": "Munkidori",
    "text": "Munkidori is a strong special attacker and pivot. Its typing allows it to hit much of the tier for at least neutral damage with its STAB moves, with Sludge Bomb and Sludge Wave targeting Fairy- and Grass-types like Sylveon and Tsareena, while Psychic and Psyshock target Poison- and Fighting-types like Vileplume and Breloom. Munkidori's Nasty Plot set loves to capitalize on the switches that it forces against these Pokemon, and with its excellent Speed tier, it can outspeed common threats like Mienshao and Flygon. Munkidori's U-turn is also incredibly potent, as it easily spreads poison with Toxic Chain to chip away at walls like Diancie, Incineroar, and Umbreon so that it can KO them more easily later. It also runs moves like Focus Blast and Tera Blast Ground to hit its poison-immune checks such as Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel and Poison-types like Alolan Muk. Trick can also limit opposing setup sweepers like Cresselia and Iron Thorns or cripple specially defensive walls upon switch-in like Bronzong and Alolan Muk. However, Munkidori is vulnerable to opposing Dark-types like Incineroar and Brute Bonnet and can be limited by Steel-types if not carrying sufficient coverage. Its poor bulk also means it can be easily revenge killed by faster Choice Scarf users like Inteleon and Infernape or Pokemon with priority such as Sucker Punch Toxicroak and Aqua Jet Basculegion. Sludge Bomb provides a greater chance of poisoning the foe, while Sludge Wave provides greater power. Psychic targets physically defensive walls like Vileplume and Galarian Slowbro, notably OHKOing Vileplume after Stealth Rock. However, Psyshock gives Munkidori an answer to specially defensive Poison-types like Tentacruel and Tera Poison Calm Mind Cresselia. U-turn lets Munkidori pivot and possibly poison specially defensive walls switching in like Diancie and Umbreon. Focus Blast targets Steel-types like Copperajah and Dark-types like Incineroar, 2HKOing both. Tera Blast Ground is a viable alternative that better targets Alolan Muk, which is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock. On Choice Scarf sets, Trick allows Munkidori to cripple walls like Alolan Muk and Registeel and setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Flygon and Calm Mind Cresselia. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Munkidori to pivot frequently and lets it not be locked into a move. On the other hand, Choice Scarf makes Munkidori one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, as it is only outsped by opposing Choice Scarf users like Infernape and Inteleon. Tera Fighting works twofold; it lets Munkidori resist Dark-type attacks and boosts the power of Focus Blast. Tera Ground, however, should only be used alongside Tera Blast. A defensive Tera type of Tera Flying also works on Munkidori, as it helps it avoid Earthquake from Flygon and retains its Fighting resistance. Munkidori benefits from teammates that can break through special walls, such as Copperajah, Bronzong, and Alolan Muk, that it struggles to deal with itself. Physical wallbreakers like Gallade, Infernape, and Mienshao help to take care of the specially defensive Steel- and Dark- types that might otherwise give Munkidori trouble. In return, Munkidori handles physical walls like Vileplume, Dragalge, Sylveon, and Avalugg. Entry hazard setters like Swampert and Klefki can be useful teammates, as their hazards alongside Munkidori's constant pivoting and threat of poison can help wear down foes over time and get them into range for Munkidori to finish them off. The poison caused by Toxic Chain makes bulky teammates like Avalugg, Vaporeon, and Sylveon good teammates, as it lets them stall out foes more easily with poison chipping away at them. At +2, Psychic OHKOes Galarian Slowbro and Avalugg, while Psyshock OHKOes Vileplume. A Nasty Plot-boosted Sludge Wave OHKOes Assault Vest Brute Bonnet, while Sludge Bomb gives Munkidori a higher chance to poison foes. Focus Blast lets Munkidori deal with Umbreon and Copperajah more easily, but boosted Tera Blast Ground can be used, as it handles Alolan Muk and Incineroar more reliably. U-turn could also be used as a last move so that Munkidori can support its team early-game, but it then heavily relies on its teammates to deal with Steel-types. Heavy Duty-Boots allows Munkidori to repeatedly switch in without concern for entry hazard chip damage, letting it use Nasty Plot repeatedly over the course of a battle. Tera Fighting is used to further boost Focus Blast's damage while letting Munkidori resist Dark-type attacks, while Tera Ground is used alongside Tera Blast to blow through checks like Alolan Muk. Tera Flying is used defensively against opposing Ground-type attackers like Swampert or Flygon, providing additional opportunities to boost with Nasty Plot. Pokemon that can overwhelm opposing Steel- and Dark-types are appreciated by Munkidori, so teammates like Cinccino, Porygon-Z, and Brambleghast pair well with it. Hazard setters like Swampert, Diancie, and Klefki can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes to further wear down opposing walls, and on hyper offense builds, hazard-setting leads like Froslass and Brambleghast work well alongside Munkidori. Since Dark- and Ground-types like Incineroar, Tera Dark Toxicroak, and Choice Scarf Flygon threaten Munkidori, teammates such as Diancie, Dragalge, and Talonflame provide switch-ins for these sweep-ending threats. Fake Out is a niche option that can be used on Toxic Chain sets with the intention of giving Munkidori as many opportunities as possible to poison the opposing Pokemon. Parting Shot can also be used as an alternative to U-turn, avoiding contact and lowering the foe's stats, but Munkidori's main draw is its ability to poison Pokemon without having to waste a turn using a status move like Toxic. Psychic Noise can also be used on pivot sets while attempting to chip down bulkier foes, preventing them from recovering while a more effective attacker switches in. Shadow Ball can be run alongside Tera Ghost to hit Bronzong, which otherwise walls Munkidori, and it can provide an immunity to priority moves like Mienshao's Fake Out and Breloom's Mach Punch. Grass Knot is a niche option alongside Tera Grass to target potential threats like specially defensive Swampert and Gastrodon but leaves Munkidori helpless against Steel-types. Tera Fairy can also be used as an alternative to Tera Fighting that maintains Munkidori's resistance to Fighting-type attacks at the cost of the potential boost to Focus Blast. Frisk is an option to regularly gain information on the foe's items but loses the potential status effects and chip damage of Toxic Chain. Dark-types: Dark-types, such as Incineroar, Brute Bonnet, and Tera Dark Toxicroak are immune to Munkidori's Psychic-type STAB moves and threaten it back with powerful moves like Knock Off and Sucker Punch. However, with access to moves like Sludge Wave, Focus Blast, Tera Blast Ground and the ability to Terastallize into a Dark-resistant Tera type, they must be cautious. Steel-types: Steel-types such as Copperajah, Klefki, and Registeel can handle Munkidori's STAB attacks easily, forcing it to rely on coverage like Focus Blast and Tera Blast Ground or its teammates to break through. They also are immune to poison, preventing Munkidori from wearing them down with Toxic Chain. Revenge Killers: While Munkidori, particularly with Choice Scarf, is quite fast, it can be outsped and its physical bulk is somewhat lacking, meaning faster Choice Scarf users like Inteleon and Infernape and priority such as Basculegion's Aqua Jet and Brute Bonnet's Sucker Punch can easily pick it off it its health gets low enough. Specially defensive Poison-types: Alolan Muk and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro can be difficult for Munkidori to break through due to their bulk, strong defensive typing, and immunity to being poisoned."

    "name": "Necrozma-Dusk Mane",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Necrozma-DM is one of the best Pokemon in Ubers. Between its sky-high Attack stat, high defensive stats, passable Speed, and a deep movepool, it is able to fulfill a huge variety of roles, which gives it a place on a lot of teams ranging from hyper offense to bulky offense and even stall. Necrozma-DM's typing allows it to check threatening Pokemon that would otherwise be very difficult to switch into consistently, like Zacian-C, Eternatus, Deoxys-A, Gliscor, and some Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy. Terastallization allows Necrozma-DM to beat threats that would otherwise check it, such as Ho-Oh and Koraidon, while allowing it to soft check other Pokemon like boosted Flutter Mane in a pinch. The omnipresence of Koraidon also helps Necrozma-DM, bolstering its Morning Sun recovery and giving it an option to stay healthy throughout the battle. However, Necrozma-DM is very slow even after a Dragon Dance boost. This makes it prone to getting outsped by a plethora of offensive Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, Deoxys-A, Zacian-C, Flutter Mane, and Choice Scarf users like Kyogre, all of which can severely hurt Necrozma-DM if not outright OHKO it. While Necrozma-DM is bulky, it is not capable of tanking hits from boosted Pokemon and therefore might get overwhelmed by what it is supposed to check, like Zacian-C, forcing it to stay very healthy if it wants to fulfill its defensive role. Necrozma-DM is oftentimes forced to Terastallize in order to beat common Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Koraidon, and Arceus formes carrying Will-O-Wisp. Furthermore, some Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground are able to check every Necrozma-DM set. Defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is one of the best setup sweepers in the format thanks to how easy it is for it to find opportunities to set up due to its excellent bulk and the rarity of Pokemon that can actually punish its setup attempts. Sunsteel Strike is Necrozma-DM's main STAB move that, despite its low PP, is very spammable due to how hard it hits most neutral targets, as well as Fairy-type Pokemon such as Arceus-Fairy, Zacian-C, Flutter Mane, and Tera Fairy users like Kyogre. If Necrozma-DM instead wants to hit Water-type Pokemon like Kyogre and Arceus-Water for neutral damage, Photon Geyser is also an option. Photon Geyser also has the added benefit of hitting one of Necrozma-DM's best checks in Ho-Oh for solid damage without needing Stealth Rock on the field. It is worth noting that both moves also hit Unaware Skeledirge quite hard. Running Photon Geyser and Sunsteel Strike in the same moveset is advised against due to its inability to hit opposing Necrozma-DM hard. Knock Off is Necrozma-DM's best option alongside Sunsteel Strike because it lets it remove key items like Ho-Oh and Kyogre's Heavy-Duty Boots, giving Necrozma-DM an opportunity to take them out later after it has used Dragon Dance if they're sufficiently worn down. Knock Off can also help Necrozma-DM remove other items like Gliscor's Toxic Orb if it didn't use Protect to activate its ability. Earthquake is the other option to consider over Knock Off and one that works best when used alongside Photon Geyser to hit the aforementioned Pokemon for high damage, particularly opposing Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C, which take less damage from Photon Geyser than they do from Sunsteel Strike. Earthquake also targets Tera Electric Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Zekrom that otherwise would break past Necrozma-DM. Tera Fire is Necrozma-DM's best type to Terastallize into because of its great defensive profile, letting it turn the tables against Koraidon and Flutter Mane while also becoming immune to Will-O-Wisp and Sacred Fire's chance to burn. The given EVs allow Necrozma-DM to avoid the OHKO from Zacian-C's +3 Tera Fighting Close Combat. Another EV spread to run is 252 HP / 136 Def / 120 Spe with an Impish nature; this allows Necrozma-DM to outspeed Deoxys-A after two Dragon Dance uses. However, Zacian-C then has a very high chance of OHKOing Necrozma-DM with a +3 Close Combat. Defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM is a key piece in many bulky offense teams due to the role compression that it brings to them; checking Zacian-C while being a good wallbreaker or sweeper that can set up on Gliscor is invaluable for them. However, it might still struggle to sweep because of its poor Speed and need of multiple Dragon Dances to actually be faster than most offensive threats. Because of this, Necrozma-DM heavily appreciates teammates like Ho-Oh, Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, Ting-Lu, Landorus-T, and Gliscor that can check the majority of Pokemon that might overwhelm it, such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, Calyrex-I, and Kyurem-B. Arceus formes also help Necrozma-DM by switching into Knock Off, preventing it from losing its item and, therefore, preventing it from taking entry hazard damage. Pokemon with access to entry hazards like the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Arceus formes can help Knock Off variants of Necrozma-DM overwhelm checks to it like Ho-Oh and Kyogre; Thunder Wave Arceus-Fairy in particular is a good teammate, as it can cripple Ho-Oh for Necrozma-DM. Choice Scarf Koraidon in particular is one of Necrozma-DM's best partners because it revenge kills many of the threats that it can't reliably check by itself like Zacian-C while bolstering Morning Sun's recovery. Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM can run an all-out offensive spread to hit as hard as possible. EdgeQuake coverage hits everything from opposing offensive Necrozma-DM, Miraidon, and Eternatus to Ho-Oh very hard, meaning that the Pokemon that actually check Necrozma-DM are limited to Pokemon like Arceus-Water, Kyogre, Ting-Lu, Arceus-Dark, defensive Necrozma-DM, and Landorus-T. Photon Geyser can be an option over Stone Edge if Necrozma-DM wishes to turn the tables on Arceus-Water and Kyogre. The combination of Sunsteel Strike and Photon Geyser allows Necrozma-DM to defeat every aforementioned check, with its counterplay becoming even more limited to faster foes like Choice Scarf Koraidon, although Ho-Oh becomes better suited to taking it on, as it survives a +1 Photon Geyser. However, Ho-Oh can get OHKOed by a +1 Photon Geyser if Necrozma-DM is running Life Orb and Tera Psychic. Lum Berry is the primary item of choice to help Necrozma-DM against status from Pokemon like Arceus-Water that might want to paralyze or burn Necrozma-DM, and it is best used with Photon Geyser, as a +1 Photon Geyser 2HKOes Arceus-Water after Stealth Rock and OHKOes it at +2 with Tera Psychic. Occa Berry allows Necrozma-DM to survive a Flare Blitz from Koraidon, letting it boost with Dragon Dance or use Sunsteel Strike or Photon Geyser for massive damage. This, however, heavily worsens Necrozma-DM's matchup against status and might force it to Terastallize into the Fire typing more often than not to play around that. Life Orb empowers Necrozma-DM's attacks to insane levels, allowing it to OHKO offensive Ho-Oh and Kyogre with Photon Geyser while 2HKOing Arceus-Water through burn. A +1 Life Orb Sunsteel Strike also has a chance to OHKO Arceus-Dark after a single round of Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fire allows Necrozma-DM to have an easier time setting up on Koraidon, Ho-Oh, and Will-O-Wisp variants of Arceus, whereas Tera Psychic empowers Photon Geyser to the point of giving Necrozma-DM a tool to potentially OHKO Ho-Oh at +1 while also resisting Koraidon's Low Kick. Necrozma-DM fits best on hyper offense teams that can capitalize on the damage it causes to opposing physical walls. Physical attackers like Koraidon, Zacian-C, Calyrex-I, and Rayquaza are all good partners because they also share common checks with Necrozma-DM in Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, and opposing Necrozma-DM and can wear them down together. Grimmsnarl can ease setup for Necrozma-DM with dual screens, Ribombee can help with Necrozma-DM's middling Speed, and Deoxys-S can get entry hazards on the field for Necrozma-DM to better deal with its checks like Giratina-O, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Ground. Trick Room makes Necrozma-DM a scary anti-offense Pokemon and late-game sweeper that can very quickly turn the tides in its favor thanks to Terastallization and powerful neutral coverage. Running Trick Room allows Necrozma-DM to fully invest in bulk, allowing it to survive hits that it would otherwise not be able to, such as unboosted Flare Blitz and Modest Origin Pulse from Koraidon and Kyogre, respectively. Photon Geyser and Earthquake provide Necrozma-DM with near-perfect neutral coverage, only missing out on select Pokemon like Skarmory and Tera Steel Giratina-O. Lum Berry allows Necrozma-DM to beat most Arceus formes one-on-one, mainly Arceus-Water that would try to burn Necrozma-DM with Will-O-Wisp. This lets Necrozma-DM set up without any fear of getting statused. Life Orb gives Photon Geyser the needed extra power to OHKO maximum Defense Ho-Oh at +2; however, Necrozma-DM needs two free turns to use the appropriate moves and thus can be played around with ease. Weakness Policy is an option as well to take advantage of Necrozma-DM's monstrous bulk, assuming it survives a super effective hit. This can prove to be a game-ender, as a +2 Necrozma-DM is very difficult for worn-down or unprepared teams to face. However, both Life Orb and Lum Berry are far better options if Necrozma-DM wants an offensive item because Weakness Policy variants are prone to getting statused. Lastly, Mental Herb might seem odd on a Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, but it helps it to play around Taunt from Pokemon like Miraidon, Deoxys formes, Arceus formes, and even Gliscor that would try and stop Necrozma-DM from using Trick Room. Tera Fire allows Necrozma-DM to avoid getting burnt by Will-O-Wisp Arceus formes and Sacred Fire from Ho-Oh while turning its Fire-type weakness into a resistance to beat Koraidon one-on-one. Trick Room Necrozma-DM fits best on hyper offense teams that want an anti-offense option that can beat Pokemon like Calyrex-I while simultaneously wanting very potent late-game insurance. Good teammates include Calyrex-I, Koraidon, Zacian-C, Rayquaza, and Kyurem-B thanks to their ability to break past common physically defensive walls like Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, Groudon, and Landorus-T. Pokemon like Deoxys-A and Glimmora make for good partners as well for their ability to soften these physical walls with entry hazards. This set, however, does not fit well onto Sticky Web hyper offense teams because it is counterproductive. Defensive Necrozma-DM takes advantage of its excellent bulk and defensive typing, which makes it one of the most reliable Stealth Rock setters and pivots. Maximum Defense investment allows Necrozma-DM to avoid the 2HKO from even +3 Zacian-C's Wild Charge, and Heavy-Duty Boots provides further protection against entry hazards. Sunsteel Strike is used because defensive Necrozma's primary role is to check Zacian-C, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Calyrex-I, which are all hit harder by Sunsteel Strike than Photon Geyser. Due to the tendency of these Pokemon to use Tera Fire, Earthquake is used as a form of counterplay, which also ensures a 2HKO against Zacian-C, Zekrom, and Tera Electric Kyurem-B. Swords Dance is used to increase Necrozma-DM's damage output and therefore do a better job at checking the Pokemon it's supposed to, with the added benefit of outdamaging defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. Swords Dance can even turn the tables against Gliscor, whose Earthquake barely scratches Necrozma-DM. Necrozma-DM can also be a consistent Stealth Rock user due to its stellar defensive profile. Alternatively, Necrozma-DM can ensure its switch-ins take Stealth Rock damage with Knock Off. Knock Off is useful for the same reasons it is on the defensive Dragon Dance set. This seriously helps out its teammates that may be blanket checked by Ho-Oh, as Necrozma-DM can do a great job at luring it. Covert Cloak can be used instead of Heavy-Duty Boots to allow Necrozma-DM to safely stay in and use Knock Off against Ho-Oh or hit it with a Swords Dance-boosted attack, as not even offensive Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire 2HKOs Necrozma-DM. However, this does necessitate good hazard control from teammates as to not leave Necrozma-DM vulnerable to hazards. Tera Ground is used on this set, as it is a great neutral defensive type, and it can be used to turn the tables on Zekrom and Tera Electric Kyurem-B by becoming immune to Electric-type attacks. Additionally, it allows Necrozma-DM to get an extra hit off against Miraidon targeting it with Electro Drift. Defensive Necrozma-DM fits best on balance teams in need of a reliable check to Zacian-C and Extreme Killer Arceus. Its favorite partners are similar to defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and include fellow hazard setters and Choice Scarf Koraidon. Arceus-Fairy is a good partner for Necrozma-DM, as it can use Thunder Wave against Ho-Oh to allow Necrozma-DM to outspeed it. Arceus-Fairy can also set Stealth Rock if Necrozma-DM is not running it. Arceus-Fairy benefits from having defensive Necrozma-DM as a partner because Necrozma-DM can check opposing Necrozma-DM that threaten Arceus-Fairy. Other notable partners for Necrozma-DM are Pokemon that help with Ho-Oh and Fire-type attacks in general, like Arceus-Water, Gliscor, and Eternatus. Covert Cloak sets really appreciate Giratina-O because it can offer Defog support to remove entry hazards, as well as providing a way to better deal with Arceus-Ground. Pokemon that appreciate Necrozma-DM's ability to effectively pressure Ho-Oh with Knock Off and Stealth Rock, like Arceus-Fairy, Koraidon, and Ho-Oh, love having it as a partner. A Choice Band set might seem interesting due to its ability to 2HKO every Arceus forme with its STAB attacks while also 2HKOing Gliscor and Ting-Lu. However, this set's viability relies entirely on good positioning and prediction. Necrozma-DM's Speed stat also lets it down in being a wallbreaker, as it is outsped by a lot of common offensive Pokemon and thus cannot make use of its excellent defensive typing nearly as much when locked into one move. Choice Band Necrozma-DM would be best suited using a set consisting of Sunsteel Strike, Photon Geyser, Earthquake and Knock Off. A specially defensive spread with Tera Ground can be used so Necrozma-DM has an easier time setting up on Calm Mind Arceus formes and Miraidon. However, Necrozma-DM can no longer check physical attackers like Zacian-C with this set, as it gets OHKOed by a +3 Close Combat. Furthermore, Ho-Oh, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu are comfortably able to check this set. Water-types: By virtue of its resistance to Steel and access to Recover, Thunder Wave, and Will-O-Wisp, Arceus-Water is the best Necrozma-DM counter available, being able to heal off the damage done by it with Recover and not minding Dragon Dance too much due to being faster than Necrozma-DM even if it's at +1. This gives Arceus-Water complete control over the one-on-one interaction, forcing Necrozma-DM to Terastallize into the Fire typing if it wants to avoid getting burnt by Will-O-Wisp, which then risks being hit by a devastating Judgment. Arceus-Water even has access to Dragon Tail if it wants to phaze Necrozma-DM, which is a safer interaction for it. However, Lum Berry, Life Orb, and Tera Psychic variants all have a positive matchup against Arceus-Water. The sun constantly being up thanks to Koraidon also makes it hard for Arceus-Water to threaten Tera Fire Necrozma-DM. Kyogre is another troublesome Pokemon for Necrozma-DM; while it does not appreciate switching into it, it can threaten to OHKO it with its STAB moves while halving Morning Sun's recovery by summoning rain. Ground-types: Arceus-Ground can switch directly into Necrozma-DM and shrug off its attacks thanks to its superb bulk and Recover. It can then use Necrozma-DM as setup bait for Dragon Dance or Calm Mind, forcing it to switch out. Pokemon like Landorus-T and Groudon are durable enough to the point where Necrozma-DM might struggle getting past them without an unreasonable amout of Dragon Dances. Landorus-T even has access to Taunt to shut down any setup or recovery attempts from it, while Groudon can use Necrozma-DM to freely use Spikes, spread burns with Will-O-Wisp or Lava Plume, and phaze it with Roar. Ting-Lu can set up Spikes on Necrozma-DM and phaze it with Whirlwind while not minding boosted attacks too much due to its high Defense. Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh is bulky enough to constantly switch into Necrozma-DM, with Regenerator further helping it accomplish this role. Furthermore, Ho-Oh can threaten a burn with Sacred Fire, forcing Necrozma-DM to either Terastallize, use a Lum Berry, or switch out. However, Stone Edge or a boosted Photon Geyser can deal extreme damage to Ho-Oh. Arceus-Dark: Arceus-Dark is one of the best counters to Necrozma-DM thanks to its immunity to Photon Geyser and access to Will-O-Wisp and Recover. Necrozma-DM can Terastallize into the Fire typing in order to comfortably beat Arceus-Dark one-on-one, but it must be careful of Judgment, especially if it has little to no bulk investment, as even an unboosted Judgment will hurt. Arceus-Dark can even fit other moves like Foul Play and Dragon Tail into its arsenal to better its matchup against a Terastallized Necrozma-DM. Sunsteel Strike variants, however, can outright beat Arceus-Dark, either taking it out or forcing a reactive Terastallization from it. Faster Foes: Choice Scarf Pokemon like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Kyogre outspeed Necrozma-DM even after a Dragon Dance, with Koraidon and Miraidon outspeeding Necrozma-DM even after it has used Dragon Dance twice. Other Pokemon like Deoxys-A, Zacian-C, Flutter Mane, Miraidon, and boosted Dragon Dance Arceus formes will outspeed a boosted Necrozma-DM as well. Physically Bulky Foes: Pokemon like Gliscor and Skarmory are bulky enough to withstand Necrozma-DM's attacks, with Skarmory having access to Iron Defense and Roost to become a very sturdy counter. Gliscor outspeeds unboosted Necrozma-DM and can proceed to either lay Spikes freely, heal off any damage done with Protect, or hit it with Earthquake for a solid 25%. Furthermore, Gliscor can also use Taunt to stop any Morning Sun healing. However, Necrozma-DM will use Gliscor as setup bait if it's not carrying Taunt in its moveset. Opposing Necrozma-DM: Defensive Necrozma-DM is a good check to itself, being able to use Swords Dance alongside defensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM and easily 2HKO it. Using Tera Ground, defensive Necrozma-DM can even beat offensive Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM one-on-one by spamming Earthquake. Giratina-O: Giratina-O is bulky enough to tank even boosted attacks from Necrozma-DM and threatens to burn it with Will-O-Wisp, phaze it with Dragon Tail, or 2HKO it with Poltergeist. Furthermore, Giratina-O can also Terastallize into the Steel typing to completely wall Necrozma-DM. Orthworm: Albeit rare, Orthworm completely walls Necrozma-DM and uses Shed Tail for free against it."

    "text": "With its unique combination of Aurora Veil, Snow Warning, and a good Speed tier, Alolan Ninetales establishes itself as a premiere lead for setting Aurora Veil, giving it the advantage over fellow dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Deoxys-S, which require two turns instead to set up. Encore shuts down setup sweepers that try to take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's mediocre offensive presence like Kingambit and punishes defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Corviknight, giving Alolan Ninetales's teammates free opportunities to set up. Freeze-Dry threatens common leads like Landorus-T, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor as well as Pelipper, which otherwise removes Alolan Ninetales's snow unthreatened. Freeze-Dry can also target certain threats like Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake. Moonblast serves as a stronger secondary STAB option to slam threats like Darkrai, Zamazenta, and Weavile that Freeze-Dry cannot while hitting Hisuian Samurott slightly harder. Alternatively, Snowscape can be run over either STAB move, allowing Alolan Ninetales to reset snow in the face of weather setters Torkoal, Ninetales, Pelipper, and Tyranitar, ensuring both Aurora Veil and the advantage in the weather wars. Though Alolan Ninetales rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Water is run to shed its Fire and Steel weaknesses, flipping the matchup on Pokemon like Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Scizor. With its invaluable ability to set dual screens in one turn, Alolan Ninetales cements itself as a lead for hyper offense teams. One sweeper that pairs exceptionally well with Alolan Ninetales is Kyurem, as its Dragon Dance set heavily appreciates both Aurora Veil and snow extending its already solid bulk to absurd levels. Other setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon similarly enjoy Aurora Veil, able to boost with near impunity then crush the opposing team. In particular, Bulk Up Great Tusk is an excellent teammate for its added entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, which Aurora Veil teams can otherwise struggle with. Rillaboom combines Grassy Terrain's recovery with Aurora Veil to allow even more opportunities for its teammates to set up with ease, which is especially useful for those weak to Earthquake like the aforementioned Raging Bolt and Kingambit. However, Alolan Ninetales's biggest foe, Cinderace, resists both of its STAB moves and can steal Aurora Veil with Court Change. Other major threats include Iron Moth and Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Scizor, which similarly ignore Alolan Ninetales's attacks, can threaten an OHKO, and, in Iron Moth's case, can set up a Substitute freely. Thus, a great partner is Manaphy, which is able to shrug off any Steel- and Fire-type attacks while synergizing well with Aurora Veil, especially for its Double Dance set. Iron Moth easily boosts on Cinderace and threatens Steel-types, as well as snowballing through sun and Sticky Web teams that would otherwise give Alolan Ninetales trouble; Aurora Veil allows Iron Moth to take a hit or two, which is especially useful for the Substitute variants. Dragonite can serve as a useful check to Iron Moth, offensive Cinderace, and other offensive threats with its powerful Extreme Speed. Another Pokemon to watch out for is Corviknight, which can remove Aurora Veil with Defog, so teammates like the aforementioned Iron Moth and Raging Bolt are useful to pressure it from ever entering the field and using Defog freely."

    "text": "Ogerpon functions as a solid pivot within the tier thanks to an array of excellent utility moves, a powerful STAB move in Ivy Cudgel, and great offensive stats. Knock Off allows Ogerpon to punish many of the Pokemon attempting to switch into it such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Skeledirge. U-turn allows Ogerpon to pivot out of matchups that are unfavorable for it such as Tinkaton, Okidogi, and Skeledirge while doing solid damage to Hydrapple that may want to switch in, and thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots, it is able to remain healthy throughout the match and easily pivot in and out of the field. Encore gives it the ability to take advantage of slower Pokemon that have locked themselves into an awkward move so it can go for a free move the turn after, such as Zapdos using Roost or Mandibuzz clicking Defog, which, when paired with Defiant, gives Ogerpon a free Attack boost. On the other hand, Ogerpon is able to use the pressure it creates as opportunities to set up Spikes for its team, helping its teammates and itself by slowly chipping down the opposing team's checks. Ogerpon's Tera type is locked into Grass, but with Embody Aspect, it is given a boost to its Speed on top of the additional boost to its STAB moves, letting it OHKO Slowking and have a chance to 2HKO Tornadus-T after Stealth Rock. This means that Ogerpon can act not only as a powerful breaker with Tera, but also as an emergency speed control option that can outrun every unboosted Pokemon in the metagame, as well as a number of boosted Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Mienshao and Excadrill after Rapid Spin. Ogerpon's Speed boost also allows it to have unique interactions with Encore, switching in on faster Pokemon to lock them into set up moves such as Calm Mind Latios or Dragon Dance Salamence. Ogerpon's pivoting and utility options are best suited on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to disrupt foes while bringing in their own threats. Wallbreakers such as Azumarill, Hisuian Arcanine, and Mamoswine love Ogerpon's ability to pivot them in safely, weaken their checks, and potentially set up Spikes for them to break more easily; In return, they are able to deal with some of Ogerpon's checks such as Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Hydrapple. Pivots that are able to synergize well with Ogerpon such as Slowking, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos make for excellent partners, being able to form a strong core while relieving Ogerpon of the pressure of taking on threats like Latios, Excadrill, and Lokix. Stealth Rock setters such as Tinkaton and Cobalion mesh well with Ogerpon that opt for Spikes by maximizing the entry hazard stacking potential, with Tinkaton able to fit Encore instead while taking on Greninja and Zapdos, while Cobalion can effectively deal with Excadrill and Lokix for it. Sandy Shocks is an excellent teammate for Ogerpon, being able to take on the Flying-types that it's afraid of, creating a VoltTurn core with it, and being able to set up Stealth Rock for it while Ogerpon handles the Water- and Grass-type attacks aimed at Sandy Shocks well while beating its key checks like Azumarill and Rotom-Wash."

    "name": "Ogerpon-Cornerstone",
    "text": "Ogerpon-C is a terrifying powerhouse, with very few defensive Pokemon able to resist its STAB combination or stand up to its sheer power after a Swords Dance. Ivy Cudgel is the STAB move of choice, capable of nailing even checks like Tinkaton and Hydrapple with a 2HKO after boosting. Power Whip, while inconsistent due to poor accuracy, is also notably stronger, allowing Ogerpon-C to OHKO offensive threats like Keldeo and Azumarill and have a chance at OHKOing Excadrill without boosting. Alternatively, while less immediately powerful, Horn Leech's healing can help Ogerpon-C to survive revenge killing attempts, and in some cases, even allow for multiple uses of Sturdy. However, while it does obtain OHKOs and 2HKOs on most notable targets, especially after a Swords Dance, the drastically lower power can cause Ogerpon-C to miss important OHKOs on targets like Slowking and Tyranitar, especially if unboosted. Ogerpon-C's last moveslot is immensely customizable thanks to its near perfect STAB combination; Stomping Tantrum gets key damage on Tinkaton, Cobalion, and Okidogi, while Spiky Shield helps to prevent being revenge killed by Lokix's First Impression and can allow Ogerpon-C to avoid being hit by Tinkaton's Gigaton Hammer entirely. It also scouts Choice Scarf users like Latios and Okidogi. Sturdy allows Ogerpon-C to be significantly more aggressive, with the ability to live any one hit from full HP allowing it to pose much more of a threat against Pokemon like Latios and Excadrill. Embody Aspect also gives Ogerpon-C unique defensive properties through Terastallization, with the Defense boost helping to improve the odds of living attacks like Scizor's Bullet Punch, and shedding Ogerpon-C's Grass typing can be handy against opposing Lokix, especially if it is not carrying Spiky Shield. Ogerpon-C fits on a wide variety of teams thanks to its high firepower, as well as its access to Sturdy allowing it to serve as an emergency check to certain threats. Entry hazard setters like Tinkaton and Sandy Shocks are valued teammates, with the chip damage they provide helping Ogerpon-C to have an even easier time securing kills. These Pokemon are also capable of helping to manage foes that may annoy Ogerpon-C such as Latios and Tornadus-T. Pivots such as Slowking and Tornadus-T are also valuable for their ability to get Ogerpon-C in safely. Methods of speed control, such as Sticky Web from Araquanid, or Pokemon that can spread paralysis such as Zapdos, Tinkaton, Slowking, and Rotom-W, are also appreciated to help Ogerpon-C get the jump on faster foes. Choice Specs Latios makes a strong partner, as it can help Ogerpon-C to deal with Okidogi, and the two can whittle down shared checks like Tinkaton and Scizor. Excadrill also greatly appreciates Ogerpon-C's ability to smash pesky Flying-types, especially Zapdos, and Ogerpon-C greatly benefits from Excadrill's hazard removal allowing it to keep Sturdy intact, as well as the extra support against Latios and Tinkaton. Powerful revenge killers, such as Lokix, are also appreciated for their ability to deal with Greninja and to pick off weakened Pokemon that Ogerpon-C may not be able to finish off. Ogerpon-C is a reliable wallbreaker thanks to its high-power STAB combination, potent coverage, and solid Speed tier, outpacing threats like Thundurus-T and Cobalion. Ogerpon-C's STAB moves have high Base Power and great coverage on the tier, hitting numerous staples such as Zapdos, Excadrill, Slowking, and Scizor for massive damage. Stomping Tantrum is good coverage against Steel-types such as Cobalion, Tinkaton, and Metagross. It is also Ogerpon-C's best option against Okidogi, one of its most prevalent answers. U-turn lets Ogerpon-C develop offensive momentum, pivoting out of bad matchups such as Metagross and Okidogi while doing good damage to other foes such as Hydrapple and Zarude. Alternatively, Spiky Shield scouts revenge killing attempts from Lokix as well as Choice item users like Greninja, Keldeo, and Scizor. After Terastallization, Embody Aspect grants Ogerpon-C a Defense boost, giving it better odds to survive an attack from Pokemon like Scizor and Excadrill and hit hard in return. Ogerpon-C fits best on offensive teams as a strong wallbreaker capable of denting various defensive Pokemon. Offensive pivots such as Tornadus-T, Latios, and Scizor are excellent teammates for it, pivoting out of Pokemon like Rhyperior, Zapdos, and Slowking to provide offensive momentum for Ogerpon-C. Additionally, these Pokemon appreciate Ogerpon-C's efficiency into their checks, namely Rhyperior, Slowking, Tyranitar, and Hisuian Arcanine, while also helping overwhelm shared checks such as Tinkaton and Metagross. Entry hazard setters such as Cobalion, Sandy Shocks, and Tinkaton appreciate Ogerpon-C's good matchups into common hazard removal Pokemon such as Excadrill and Mandibuzz, while the hazards they set make it more difficult to switch into it. In return, these Pokemon can answer Pokemon that would otherwise be able to overwhelm Ogerpon-C such as Lokix, Scizor, and Choice Scarf Hoopa-U, respectively. Ogerpon-C is extremely vulnerable to Okidogi, which resists its STAB combination and can hit hard in return with either of its STAB moves. Thus, Pokemon that can force Okidogi out such as Latios, Choice Scarf Hoopa-U, and Tornadus-T are greatly appreciated, preventing Okidogi from getting either a setup opportunity with Bulk Up or creating offensive momentum off of Ogerpon-C with other sets. Ogerpon-C's Speed, while very high, can leave it vulnerable to Pokemon like Greninja, Tornadus-T, Choice Scarf Hoopa-U, and Choice Scarf Okidogi. It is also vulnerable to Lokix's First Impression. Thus, countermeasures to these foes such as Azumarill, Tinkaton, and Zapdos are greatly appreciated."

  "Ogerpon-Wellspring": {
    "name": "Ogerpon-Wellspring",
    "text": "With its Wellspring Mask-boosted power and good Speed tier alongside Swords Dance, Ogerpon-W is one of the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame. Generally, Power Whip is the better option, but at the cost of considerable power, it can opt for the more-accurate Horn Leech, which aids in recovering the chip damage it often takes from entry hazards throughout a game. However, it notably misses out on OHKOing Pelipper at +2 and Tera Water users like Galarian Slowking, Calm Mind Hatterene, and specially defensive Gliscor. Play Rough augments Ogerpon-W's coverage by allowing it to hit targets such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Encore generates setup opportunities by locking foes into undesirable moves, such as Roost and Iron Defense from Corviknight or Skarmory, Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Knock Off can be used instead, which has the utility of removing items such as Dragonite's Heavy-Duty Boots and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet all while still hitting Dragapult, and it notably lands an OHKO after a Swords Dance versus defensive Gholdengo. Trailblaze is also an option; the boost to Ogerpon-W's Speed improves its ability to sweep, preventing it from being revenge killed by the likes of Weavile, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Water Absorb allows it to take advantage of foes like Barraskewda and Alomomola using Flip Turn, preventing them from generating momentum, while its Scald immunity lets it freely set up on Alomomola. Tera Water is forced and bolsters the strength of Ivy Cudgel to absurd levels; after a Swords Dance, this allows it to OHKO Kingambit as well as Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock. In conjunction with the Special Defense boost granted by Embody Aspect, Tera Water has useful defensive properties too, allowing Ogerpon-W to check the likes of Iron Moth, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo in a pinch. Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking prowess makes it well-suited to hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Kingambit is a good partner, as Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking enables it late-game through weakening foes that deal with it, such as Skarmory and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Similarly, Ogerpon-W appreciates Kingambit's ability to check Dragapult. Ogerpon-W is susceptible to taking a lot of chip damage from hazards as the game goes on; consequently, this makes Great Tusk a good partner, as it can keep them off the field. Choice Scarf Enamorus is a good partner, as it provides Healing Wish support, giving Ogerpon-W a second chance at wearing down the opponent's team. Ogerpon-W appreciates hazard support, as that helps facilitate its wallbreaking; teammates such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S are useful. Ogerpon-W often struggles to find opportunities to come in; pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T are helpful. Galarian Slowking in particular also helps check Zapdos, which is one of the few Pokemon that Ogerpon-W can struggle against, while Landorus-T's ability to provide Stealth Rock is also appreciated. Iron Valiant, Calm Mind variants especially, is a good partner that appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to pressure checks such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. In return, Iron Valiant is able to threaten Raging Bolt and faster threats that can revenge kill Ogerpon-W, such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Meowscarada. Ogerpon-W is a fantastic pivot thanks to its combination of high Speed, power, and utility. It can outspeed and threaten out many key threats such as Great Tusk, Heatran, and Gliscor with its powerful Ivy Cudgel, which it can capitalize on to gain momentum with U-turn. Horn Leech complements Ivy Cudgel, hitting bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Primarina for super effective damage and recovering HP, which is useful for mitigating entry hazard damage. U-turn allows Ogerpon-W to pivot out of bad matchups against Dragapult and Dragonite while also dealing high damage to Roaring Moon and many Grass-types that may want to switch into it, such as Rillaboom, Serperior, and Hydrapple. Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Clefable and Tera Grass Heatran from setting up entry hazards or using status as well as stopping recovery or setup attempts from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Dragonite, or Corviknight, which is useful in wearing them down over time. Alternatively, Encore can be used to punish setup from various Pokemon such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Garganacl while similarly disrupting walls such as Corviknight and Skarmory. Spikes can be run over Taunt or Encore, as Ogerpon-W can find many opportunities to lay Spikes due to the switches it forces and has good match-ups against various hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Spikes synergizes well with U-turn, as their combined chip damage will wear down many of Ogerpon-W's switch-ins such as Tera Dragon Skarmory and Raging Bolt over time. Water Absorb allows Ogerpon-W to more safely switch into opposing Water-types such as Barraskewda, Hisuian Samurott, and Alomomola, notably making it riskier for these Pokemon to gain momentum with Flip Turn. Ogerpon-W is an average Terastallization candidate, as it is filling a supportive role and its Tera type is telegraphed. Nonetheless, the Special Defense boost Ogerpon-W gains when Terastallizing can be useful in a few scenarios, such as surviving Choice Specs Walking Wake's Draco Meteor and Gholdengo's Nasty Plot-boosted Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock. The lack of a Grass typing also allows it to match up more favorably against Pokemon such as Weavile, Iron Moth, and Heatran. The damage increase provided by Tera Water can also be useful, allowing Ogerpon-W to 2HKO Skarmory and Corviknight with Ivy Cudgel after Stealth Rock. Ogerpon-W thrives on bulky offense teams. It synergizes well with other pivoting Pokemon. Landorus-T appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to handle opposing Water-types such as Primarina while providing Ogerpon-W with Stealth Rock and Intimidate support. Landorus-T can also check Roaring Moon and Raging Bolt, which are difficult matchups for Ogerpon-W. Galarian Slowking benefits from Ogerpon-W's presence to deal with Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Gliscor as well as strong Water-types that can otherwise overwhelm it such as Walking Wake. In turn, Galarian Slowking can support Ogerpon-W via Future Sight and status spreading with Thunder Wave or Toxic, which are useful to wear down and cripple checks such as Dragonite and Raging Bolt. Galarian Slowking also checks key threats such as Serperior and Zapdos, which Ogerpon-W appreciates. Since Ogerpon-W is great at luring and breaking down the opponent's physical walls with Taunt or Encore, partners such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Roaring Moon can take advantage of the holes Ogerpon-W puts into walls such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Gliscor to sweep more easily. Entry hazard support helps wear down many of Ogerpon-W's checks such as Raging Bolt and Serperior, so setters such as Great Tusk, Deoxys-S, and Ting-Lu are recommended teammates. As Ogerpon-W cannot hold Heavy-Duty Boots, it is quite vulnerable to entry hazard damage over time; hazard removal or prevention support from Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Hatterene, or Cinderace is thus appreciated. Ogerpon-W is good at luring several Pokemon such as Serperior, Rillaboom, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite, which it can safely pivot out of with U-turn; Dragapult can take advantage of Rillaboom, Raging Bolt, and Serperior, while Air Balloon Kingambit and Gholdengo do well against Dragonite. Additionally, Dragapult in particular can support Ogerpon-W further by spreading status."

    "name": "Ogerpon-Wellspring-Tera",
    "text": "With its Wellspring Mask-boosted power and good Speed tier alongside Swords Dance, Ogerpon-W is one of the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame. Generally, Power Whip is the better option, but at the cost of considerable power, it can opt for the more-accurate Horn Leech, which aids in recovering the chip damage it often takes from entry hazards throughout a game. However, it notably misses out on OHKOing Pelipper at +2 and Tera Water users like Galarian Slowking, Calm Mind Hatterene, and specially defensive Gliscor. Play Rough augments Ogerpon-W's coverage by allowing it to hit targets such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Encore generates setup opportunities by locking foes into undesirable moves, such as Roost and Iron Defense from Corviknight or Skarmory, Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Knock Off can be used instead, which has the utility of removing items such as Dragonite's Heavy-Duty Boots and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet all while still hitting Dragapult, and it notably lands an OHKO after a Swords Dance versus defensive Gholdengo. Trailblaze is also an option; the boost to Ogerpon-W's Speed improves its ability to sweep, preventing it from being revenge killed by the likes of Weavile, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Water Absorb allows it to take advantage of foes like Barraskewda and Alomomola using Flip Turn, preventing them from generating momentum, while its Scald immunity lets it freely set up on Alomomola. Tera Water is forced and bolsters the strength of Ivy Cudgel to absurd levels; after a Swords Dance, this allows it to OHKO Kingambit as well as Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock. In conjunction with the Special Defense boost granted by Embody Aspect, Tera Water has useful defensive properties too, allowing Ogerpon-W to check the likes of Iron Moth, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo in a pinch. Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking prowess makes it well-suited to hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Kingambit is a good partner, as Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking enables it late-game through weakening foes that deal with it, such as Skarmory and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Similarly, Ogerpon-W appreciates Kingambit's ability to check Dragapult. Ogerpon-W is susceptible to taking a lot of chip damage from hazards as the game goes on; consequently, this makes Great Tusk a good partner, as it can keep them off the field. Choice Scarf Enamorus is a good partner, as it provides Healing Wish support, giving Ogerpon-W a second chance at wearing down the opponent's team. Ogerpon-W appreciates hazard support, as that helps facilitate its wallbreaking; teammates such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S are useful. Ogerpon-W often struggles to find opportunities to come in; pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T are helpful. Galarian Slowking in particular also helps check Zapdos, which is one of the few Pokemon that Ogerpon-W can struggle against, while Landorus-T's ability to provide Stealth Rock is also appreciated. Iron Valiant, Calm Mind variants especially, is a good partner that appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to pressure checks such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. In return, Iron Valiant is able to threaten Raging Bolt and faster threats that can revenge kill Ogerpon-W, such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Meowscarada. Ogerpon-W is a fantastic pivot thanks to its combination of high Speed, power, and utility. It can outspeed and threaten out many key threats such as Great Tusk, Heatran, and Gliscor with its powerful Ivy Cudgel, which it can capitalize on to gain momentum with U-turn. Horn Leech complements Ivy Cudgel, hitting bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Primarina for super effective damage and recovering HP, which is useful for mitigating entry hazard damage. U-turn allows Ogerpon-W to pivot out of bad matchups against Dragapult and Dragonite while also dealing high damage to Roaring Moon and many Grass-types that may want to switch into it, such as Rillaboom, Serperior, and Hydrapple. Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Clefable and Tera Grass Heatran from setting up entry hazards or using status as well as stopping recovery or setup attempts from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Dragonite, or Corviknight, which is useful in wearing them down over time. Alternatively, Encore can be used to punish setup from various Pokemon such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Garganacl while similarly disrupting walls such as Corviknight and Skarmory. Spikes can be run over Taunt or Encore, as Ogerpon-W can find many opportunities to lay Spikes due to the switches it forces and has good match-ups against various hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Spikes synergizes well with U-turn, as their combined chip damage will wear down many of Ogerpon-W's switch-ins such as Tera Dragon Skarmory and Raging Bolt over time.

Galarian Slowking benefits from Ogerpon-W's presence to deal with Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Gliscor as well as strong Water-types that can otherwise overwhelm it such as Walking Wake. In turn, Galarian Slowking can support Ogerpon-W via Future Sight and status spreading with Thunder Wave or Toxic, which are useful to wear down and cripple checks such as Dragonite and Raging Bolt.

  "Okidogi": {
    "name": "Okidogi",
    "text": "Okidogi is a dangerous threat with Bulk Up thanks to its great typing, both offensively and defensively, and fantastic ability in Toxic Chain, allowing it to put walls like Skeledirge, Hippowdon, and Zapdos on a timer and giving it a huge advantage over its competition. Poison Jab is preferred due to being more reliable and also having a higher chance of poisoning the target; however, Gunk Shot is an alternative that has a much higher damage output, which notably has a high chance to both 2HKO Sinistcha after Stealth Rock and a high chance to KO Hydrapple. It also allows Okidogi to avoid making contact with Zapdos, avoiding being punished by Static. Drain Punch provides Okidogi with a strong form of recovery that can make it hard to take down once it accumulates multiple boosts. Psychic Fangs nails opposing Okidogi, Toxapex, and Pecharunt, while Knock Off can be a more utility-favored option to remove key items from Zapdos, Slowking, and Skeledirge. Substitute helps take advantage of passive Pokemon and potentially prevent threats like Latios from revenge killing it. However, it has to give up Poison Jab or coverage, making it easier for Pokemon like Pecharunt and Zapdos to pivot into Okidogi. Leftovers lets Okidogi take advantage of its typing and natural bulk to answer Pokemon like Zarude, Cobalion, and Ogerpon-C. The EV spread lets Okidogi take two Life Orb-boosted Surfs from Greninja and survive an Earthquake from Excadrill from full. It also avoids being OHKOed by Hurricane from defensive Zapdos and avoids the 2HKO from Hurricane if Tera is committed. The Speed investment gets the jump on Tinkaton, preventing it from locking Okidogi into Bulk Up with Encore. The rest of the EVs are invested into Attack, notably allowing Okidogi to OHKO Choice Scarf Okidogi with Psychic Fangs, 2HKO Latios with Poison Jab, and have a high chance to OHKO Excadrill. Okidogi's typing is extremely useful, so Tera should only be used if necessary to KO a dangerous Pokemon or if Okidogi is in a position to create an advantage or outright win the game. Tera is primarily used to shed its weaknesses to better combat Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Excadrill. Tera Fairy retains useful resistances but can help deal with the threat of Draco Meteor from Latios and Hydrapple. Tera Dragon improves Okidogi's ability to take hits from revenge killers like Greninja and Thundurus-T. Tera Electric can be considered, as it allows Okidogi to beat Tornadus-T and Zapdos more reliably, avoiding Static from the latter as well as Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Slowking. Okidogi fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that value the defensive utility its typing brings along with the potency of it as a wincon with Bulk Up. Okidogi is susceptible to many faster threats that can force it out such as Sandy Shocks, Latios, and Choice Scarf Hoopa-U. Hydrapple and Serperior are great answers to Sandy Shocks, as well as pressuring Slowking and other Ground-types like Excadrill and Hippowdon, the latter notably able to force Okidogi out with Whirlwind. Serperior can also provide utility through Glare to punish Pokemon like Latios and Tornadus-T, making them slow enough for Okidogi to nail them with a powerful attack. Mandibuzz and Tinkaton are fantastic defensive answers to the aforementioned Psychic-types, with the former providing Defog support and the latter Stealth Rock support. Lokix and Scizor are also valuable teammates to consider, as their strong priority moves can threaten these faster foes and can bring Okidogi in safely with U-turn against Pokemon like Cobalion and Mandibuzz. Other entry hazard setters like Rhyperior and Sandy Shocks are ideal to help wear down Pokemon such as Pecharunt and Metagross into range of a boosted attack; Okidogi can support this further if opting to run Knock Off. These Ground-types are also able to check Tornadus-T and Zapdos, the premier Flying-types that force Okidogi out. Toxapex and Skeledirge, while vulnerable to Okidogi's coverage and the latter to Toxic Chain, can be troublesome to break through, so Pokemon like Ogerpon-C, Thundurus-T, and Hoopa-U are capable of overwhelming them. Choice Scarf Okidogi serves as a fast wallbreaker in the metagame, outspeeding every unboosted Pokémon in the tier even with an Adamant nature and blasting through foes like Serperior, Ogerpon-C, and Greninja, and its Toxic Chain ability makes it difficult to punish even with bulkier resists. It does this while leveraging its typing and bulk to find entry on foes like the aforementioned Ogerpon-C, Cobalion, and Lokix. Gunk Shot is the preferred Poison-type STAB move on this set, as its higher power allows it to more effectively break while also dodging the chance to be paralyzed by Static. Knock Off acts as coverage for Skeledirge, Slowking, Latios, and Pecharunt while also removing items from foes to gain further progress. Psychic Fangs allows Okidogi to hit Poison-types like Toxapex and opposing Okidogi super effectively. Tera Fighting gives Okidogi's Close Combat an extra kick in power, allowing it to more effectively break through foes, notably 2HKOing Mandibuzz, and clean late-game. However, it should be noted that shedding the Poison typing removes entry points for Okidogi due to it losing resistances, so Tera should only be used if it is absolutely needed to break through a foe or if it is able to clean the rest of the opponent's team. Choice Scarf Okidogi fits on balance and offense teams that appreciate its Speed and breaking power to help get progress in games. However, as a Choice item user, it is hindered by foes like Toxapex, Pecharunt, and Slowking scouting the attack it locks into and switching to something to blank it. As a result, it appreciates teammates that can either pressure them or assist in overwhelming them like Latios, Excadrill, and Zapdos, which, alongside Tornadus-T and Slowking, also provides a pivot that can bring Okidogi in on opponents it can pressure like Latios and Tyranitar. Other teammates that Choice Scarf Okidogi appreciates are ones that can switch into more offensively capable opponents that resist one of its STAB moves like opposing Zapdos and Metagross. Examples of these potential teammates include Rhyperior and Rotom-W, the former of which can also set up Stealth Rock to assist in wearing down Okidogi's checks. While it may outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, it does miss out on some Speed-boosted threats such as Greninja and Quaquaval, so priority users like Lokix and Scizor can be considered in the event a team cannot prevent them from getting a boost. With an Assault Vest, Okidogi is able to strike a perfect balance of offense and defense, using its naturally high Attack and physical bulk combined with the special bulk provided by the Assault Vest to better handle Pokemon like Hydrapple, Greninja, and Thundurus-T. Knock Off synergizes very well with Okidogi's ability Toxic Chain, allowing it to simultaneously remove items and badly poison foes, heavily wearing down bulky Pokemon like Slowking, Skeledirge, Rotom-W, and Mandibuzz. Gunk Shot can be used as an alternative to Poison Jab, offering more power at the cost of less accuracy. Psychic Fangs allows Okidogi to hit Toxapex, which otherwise walls it, while also either outright KOing or heavily damaging opposing Okidogi depending on the set. 16 Speed EVs allow Okidogi to outspeed Azumarill. The HP and Special Defense EVs allow Okidogi to avoid a 2HKO from Battle Bond Greninja's Surf at +1, and the remaining EVs go into Attack to allow it to OHKO Excadrill with Drain Punch. Tera Fairy gives Okidogi a Dragon immunity, allowing it to switch into powerful Draco Meteors from Hydrapple and Latios while maintaining a resistance to Greninja's Dark Pulse. It also allows Okidogi to take neutral damage from Excadrill's Earthquake and Zapdos's and Tornadus-T's Hurricane, giving Okidogi the perfect middle ground to reactively Tera away from its biggest threats. However, Okidogi's base typing is incredible defensively, so it should only be Terastallized when absolutely necessary. Okidogi fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its combination of power, bulk, and ability to slowly whittle down foes via Toxic Chain. Lokix makes a great partner for Okidogi, as it is able to reliably revenge kill Pokemon like Hoopa-U, Latios, and Greninja, which otherwise threaten Okidogi, with First Impression. Mandibuzz and Zarude also fufill similar roles, and all three Dark-types also act as pivots to bring Okidogi in safely on Pokemon like Cobalion and Enamorus-T. Mandibuzz also provides entry hazard removal to keep Okidogi from getting worn down over time. Okidogi is also susceptible to Ground- and Flying-type moves, so Pokemon that can handle these attacks, like Zapdos, Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, Hydrapple, and Zarude, make for great partners. Zapdos handles Lokix and Cobalion, absorbing Knock Off from the former and preventing Okidogi from being paralyzed by the latter. Rotom-W and Tornadus-T both handle Greninja for Okidogi, with Rotom-W also handling Mamoswine and Tornadus-T also handling Latios, and Hydrapple and Zarude check Sandy Shocks and Excadrill for Okidogi. Okidogi pairs very well with hazard setters like Excadrill, Rhyperior, and Metagross, as the combination of hazard damage and Toxic damage from Toxic Chain can wear down bulkier opponents incredibly fast. In return, these Pokemon can threaten Pecharunt, Skeledirge, and Toxapex for Okidogi."

    "text": "With its superb typing and access to Quiver Dance, Oricorio-G is a scary sweeper that aims to get boosts in the mid to late-game to clean up the enemy team. Its Ghost / Flying typing gives it a myriad of resistances, allowing it to check and set up on common Pokemon like Virizion and Toxicroak. Flying / Ghost STAB attacks are nearly unresisted, hitting everything save Naclstack and Morpeko for at least neutral damage while hitting many common Pokemon like Bruxish and Virizion super effectively. Offensive sets allow Oricorio-G to be a terrifying sweeper that can easily clean up mid- to late-game, while its defensive set uses its great typing to set up multiple times and slowly take apart bulkier teams. However, Oricorio-G has trouble setting up due to its deceptive frailty when uninvested and can struggle to threaten much without numerous boosts when invested into bulk. It's also quite reliant on Terastallization to bypass its answers like Sneasel and Snorlax. Oricorio-G aims to be as offensively threatening as possible, with its STAB moves of Revelation Dance and Hurricane being near-unresisted, hitting most of the tier for at least neutral damage. Revelation Dance acts like a pseudo-Tera Blast that changes type when Terastallized, letting Oricorio-G tailor its coverage to beat certain types of Pokemon. Tera Fighting allows Oricorio-G to better threaten Normal-types like Dudunsparce, Dark-types like Sneasel, Steel-types like Orthworm, and Rock-types like Rhydon. Tera Ground hits Electric-types like Jolteon as well as the Poison- and Rock-types while giving it resistances to these types. Offensive Oricorio-G best fits on offensive teams alongside other setup sweepers like Virizion, Sneasel and Mesprit. They mutually benefit from each other softening up opposing walls like Articuno and Hisuian Qwilfish to enable a final sweep. Fighting-types like Toxicroak and Hisuian Sneasel threaten the Normal- and Dark-types that Oricorio-G struggles breaking past, easing its need to Terastallize. Defensive answers to Normal-types like Regirock and Palosand are appreciated as well. Oricorio-G also appreciates special wallbreakers like Clawitzer and Alolan Exeggutor that weaken the opposing team's special walls such as Snorlax. Entry hazard setters like Rhydon and Qwilfish help wear down foes to allow an easier sweep for Oricorio-G. Bulky Oricorio-G leverages its great defensive typing and decent bulk to be a threatening late-game Quiver Dance sweeper. Air Slash is used over Revelation Dance for its lack of immunities prior to Terastallization. Roost helps Oricorio-G stave off chip damage and stay healthy. Taunt denies opposing setup and recovery moves as well as status moves like Toxic from Qwilfish and Dudunsparce, Haze from Articuno, and Roar from Piloswine. Heavy-Duty Boots gives Oricorio-G an immunity to Stealth Rock, giving it more opportunities to switch in and set up. Grassy Seed is an alternative on Grassy Terrain teams to give Oricorio-G a Defense boost, giving it much needed physical bulk to take strong neutral attacks like Bruxish's Psychic Fangs. Tera Steel gives Oricorio-G a Rock resistance and a Poison immunity, while Tera Fairy gives it a Dark resistance and a Dragon immunity while still being resistant to Fighting. Balance teams can easily fit Oricorio-G for its myriad of immunities and potential to sweep late-game. Oricorio-G struggles with Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon such as Regirock and Orthworm, so Ground- and Water-type teammates like Qwilfish and Sandslash are good options for teammates. Fighting-type teammates like Virizion and Passimian are excellent partners, as they can also threaten Rock- and Steel- types as well as bulky Normal-types like Snorlax and Dudunsparce. Checks to Electric-type Pokemon such as Hisuian Decidueye and Toedscruel cover Oricorio-Gs weakness to them. Special wallbreakes like Whimsicott and Sceptile can help Oricorio-G to wear down special walls or clean up after it. Strong physical attackers like Bruxish and Passimian can also help threaten special walls that Oricorio-G struggles with like Articuno and Hisuian Qwilfish, and in return, it can take advantage of their checks like Dipplin and Sandaconda. Oricorio-G greatly benefits from entry hazard-stacking teammates like the aforementioned Qwilfish and Sandaconda, as they chip away at its checks, and Oricorio-G can double as a spinblocker for them. On Grassy Terrain teams it synergizes well with other setup sweepers like Farigiraf and Mesprit; on these teams, it aims to break apart bulky cores that its teammates may struggle with. Substitute can be used over Taunt to shut down Dudunsparce as a check but doesn't do much else for Oricorio-G. Oricorio-G can be used as a defensive Defogger, but this role is better done by Drifblim. Normal-types: Snorlax and Dudunsparce are two of Oricorio-Gs best walls, as they can easily take it's moves with their huge bulk, and can threaten it in return with Crunch or Heat Crash from Snorlax and Toxic or Dragon Tail from Dudunsparce. However, Snorlax struggles with hazards and lack of reliable recovery, and both walls can be countered with Tera Fighting. Offensive Normal-types like Braviary and Indeedee-F can also switch into Oricorio-Gs moves and threaten it out. Rock-types: Regirock and Rhydon can easily take hits from Oricorio-G and either cripple it or phaze it. Rhydon also threatens huge damage on Oricorio-G with its Rock-type moves. However, these Pokemon have no reliable recovery and can be worn down over the course of a game. Naclstack is also a huge annoyance due to it resisting both its STAB moves pre-Terastallization, and being able to wear it down with Salt Cure, and remain healthy with Recover. Steel-types: While few, Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton completely shut down bulky Oricorio-G and can set up on it or attack it back. Magneton threatens it with powerful super effective attacks, while Orthworm can set Stealth Rock and use Coil on it. However, these two Pokemon lack reliable recovery, allowing them to be worn down over the course of the game. Electric-types: Electric-types like Jolteon and Hisuian Electrode can switch into Oricorio-G and severely damage it with their STAB moves. All Electric-types bar Rotom can also take any of Oricorio-Gs unboosted attacks and generate momentum on it with Volt Switch. Special Walls: Offensive Oricorio-G gets completely shut down by Articuno, and, while bulky Oricorio-G can deny Haze and Roar with Taunt, it must be wary of being PP stalled out of its only attacking move. Hisuian Qwilfish can also beat Oricorio-G with Toxic and Pain Split while being generally unthreatened by its attacks. Other more uncommon special walls like Muk and Malamar can also shrug off its attacks and cripple it in return. Strong Physical Attackers: Fast and powerful physical attackers like Sneasel and Bruxish can capitalize on Oricorio-G’s lower physical bulk and threatens it out with super effective attacks. However, these attackers tend to have difficulty switching in and can be outsped and KOed, should Oricorio-G get a boost prior. Glastrier is an exception to this with its huge bulk and can easily scare Oricorio-G out."

  "Orthworm": {
    "name": "Orthworm",
    "text": "Orthworm is an excellent defensive Pokemon thanks to its great physical bulk, Steel typing, and complementary immunity to Ground from Earth Eater. Common Pokemon like Coil Dudunsparce, Snorlax, and Sandaconda struggle to break through Orthworm on their own, while other Pokemon like Grafaiai, Farigiraf, and Mesprit must either dedicate a coverage move for Orthworm or Terastallize. Orthworm's fantastic defensive profile gives it ample opportunities to switch in and set up entry hazards with Stealth Rock and Spikes for its teammates. Orthworm is also a resilient hazard setter against hazard removers like Sandslash and offensive Hisuian Avalugg. Heavy Slam has the best immediate power and coverage of Orthworm's attacks against foes like Grafaiai and Articuno, deals super effective damage to Froslass, and wrecks Whimsicott and Tera Fairy Pokemon such as Jolteon and Mesprit. Body Press is strong against Dudunsparce, Snorlax, and Glastrier, and it 2HKOes heavier foes and foes that resist Heavy Slam such as Magneton, Hisuian Avalugg, and Jolteon. The increased resilience and additional power to Body Press provided by Iron Defense enable Orthworm to beat physical attackers like Brute Bonnet, set up on setup sweepers such as Coil Dudunsparce and Snorlax, and overwhelm physically defensive Pokemon such as Hisuian Decidueye and Regirock lacking Iron Defense. Orthworm can lean into its hazard setting capabilities by running Stealth Rock and Spikes, taking advantage of Choice item attackers like Mesprit and Grafaiai and accepting its own lack of longevity as a defensive Pokemon. Protect helps Orthworm maximize recovery from Leftovers and scout Choice item attackers like Passimian, Magneton, and Typhlosion. Tera Ghost makes Orthworm more secure against Fighting-type physical attacks like Close Combat from Passimian, Glastrier, and Lycanroc, Body Press from Regirock and opposing Orthworm, and Low Kick from Grafaiai. Tera Ghost also enables Orthworm to block Rapid Spin from Sandslash and Hisuian Avalugg to preserve the entry hazards it sets. Tera Electric leaves Orthworm without weaknesses, so it can more efficiently set hazards and take on physical attackers. Orthworm's EVs are tailored to patch up its lower special bulk to enable it to take on special attackers like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Whimsicott more comfortably while still giving it enough physical bulk to survive a +2 Low Kick from Grafaiai, Close Combat from Passimian, and 2 Low Kicks from Sneasel. Orthworm is a good fit for bulky offense teams looking for an entry hazard setter, and its limited longevity is a better fit for the playstyle compared to more passive hazard setters like Dudunsparce, Palossand, and Sandaconda. Offensive Pokemon such as Charizard, Jolteon, and Typhlosion adore checks to them like Snorlax and Regirock taking residual damage from Orthworm's entry hazards. Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Hisuian Decidueye commonly run Knock Off, which complements Orthworm's entry hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon such as Palossand, Dudunsparce, and Charizard and helping wear them down. Charizard can comfortably take Orthworm's attacks and threaten it out, so Orthworm appreciates support from partners like Snorlax, Floatzel, Lanturn, and Cramorant that can threaten Charizard and other Fire-types like Typhlosion. Hazard removers like Hisuian Decidueye and Cramorant are appreciated by Orthworm because residual damage from Spikes racks up quickly on it and limits its defensive capabilities. Rapid Spin users like Sandslash, Hitmonlee, and Cryogonal remove entry hazards without removing Orthworm's entry hazards. Fighting-types like Hisuian Decidueye, Virizion, and Passimian can overpower Orthworm with their super effective STAB moves, so checks to them such as Mesprit, Oricorio-G, and Weezing are appreciated. Orthworm is a great partner for Pokemon vulnerable to Ground-types such as Lycanroc, Qwilfish, and Jolteon locked into Electric-type moves."

  "Palossand": {
    "name": "Palossand",
    "text": "Palossand's great physical bulk, unique typing, and access to recovery enable it to wall many physical attackers such as Passimian, Snorlax, and Regirock. Palossand's Ghost typing enables it to block Rapid Spin from Sandslash and can help it in a pinch against Hisuian Avalugg despite Palossand's Ice weakness, which adds to Palossand's reliability as an entry hazard setter. Palossand's decent Special Attack and STAB Shadow Ball's neutral coverage are acceptably strong and keep Palossand from being too passive. Scorching Sands is a nice complementary STAB move that can spread burns, making Palossand’s role as a physical wall even easier by stifling physical sweepers such as Snorlax without Rest and Coil Dudunsparce. Sludge Bomb is an alternative to threaten Grass-types that check Palossand like Hisuian Decidueye and Whimsicott. Tera Dragon lets Palossand flip its weaknesses versus Water- and Grass-types, whereas Tera Water trades a Grass resistance for an Ice resistance, and both have great synergy with Water Compaction. Tera Poison grants Palossand a poison immunity and Grass resistance for Grass-type counters like Whimsicott and Dipplin while retaining a good defensive matchup against Fighting-type moves. Palossand is a great addition to teammates looking for a partner that provides role compression of taking on physical attackers and setting up Stealth Rock. Specially defensive Pokemon form great bulky cores with Palossand. Snorlax can use Thick Fat to take on challenging Ice-type attackers like Frosmoth and Articuno for Palossand, and it appreciates Palossand dealing with Fighting-type threats to it like Passimian and Hitmonlee. Articuno threatens Water- and Grass-types like Clawitzer and Whimsicott for Palossand with its Freeze-Dry, and in turn, it enjoys Palossand providing protection against problematic physical attackers like Regirock and Snorlax. Dudunsparce can take on special attackers like Sceptile and Mismagius for Palossand, using its great bulk, Toxic, and Dragon Tail to mitigate setup opportunities Palossand offers, while Dudunsparce appreciates Palossand taking on Fighting-types like Toxicroak and Hisuian Sneasel that would threaten to break it or cause it to Terastallize prematurely. Hisuian Decidueye and Lurantis resist many of Palossand’s weaknesses and can support Rocky Helmet Palossand by using Defog to help with hazard chip damage. Dipplin can absorb Knock Off for Palossand thanks to Sticky Hold, and other Grass-types such as Whimsicott and Virizion can also threaten the Grass- and Water-types Palossand struggles with, such as Bruxish. Qwilfish and Hisuian Qwilfish enjoy Palossand keeping their Spikes up, while Palossand appreciates Intimidate and hazard stacking to wear down the Pokemon it walls. A Colbur Berry can dull the initial damage from Knock Off if Palossand is facing off against strong attackers like Hitmonlee, Passimian, or Toxicroak, but the passive benefits of Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots carry over better if Palossand Terastallizes. The additional power of Earth Power is less useful to Palossand compared to fishing for status with Scorching Sands and Sludge Bomb. Tera Dark affords Palossand more flexibility against Bruxish, Rotom, and Prankster-boosted status moves from Grafaiai and Whimsicott. Grass-types: Virizion and Hisuian Decidueye can threaten Palossand and can set up to break past its physical bulk. Specially offensive Grass-types like Whimsicott, Hisuian Electrode, Sceptile, and Alolan Exeggutor take advantage of Palossand's poorer special bulk. Hisuian Decidueye and Lurantis can remove Palossand's Stealth Rock, and the both of them and Dipplin can use Palossand as an opportunity to set up. All Grass-types must be wary of Sludge Bomb though, and Scorching Sands's burn chance is problematic for physically offensive ones. Ice-types: Bulky Ice-types like Frosmoth and Glastrier threaten Palossand and can use it to set up. Articuno is similarly bulky and only dislikes a lucky Sludge Bomb poison. Sneasel can break through Palossand, but neither it nor Glastrier want to take a burn from Scorching Sands, and chip damage from Rocky Helmet adds up on Sneasel if it uses Triple Axel. Palossand blocks Rapid Spin from Hisuian Avalugg and threatens it with Scorching Sands but takes a lot of damage from Mountain Gale. Water-types: Bruxish, Floatzel, and Veluza can break past Palossand’s great bulk with their powerful Water-type STAB moves but must consider Water Compaction, Tera, and Palossand’s Shadow Ball. Clawitzer has few issues breaking Palossand. Cramorant's special bulk and Ground immunity let it consistently use Defog against Palossand. Special Attackers: Special wallbreakers like Mesprit and Jolteon break past Palossand’s much lower special bulk but are vulnerable to Shadow Ball and Scorching Sands. Bulky special sweepers like Calm Mind Dudunsparce, Farigiraf, and Oricorio-G can exploit Palossand’s underwhelming damage output to set up, but the former two don’t enjoy taking an unlucky status, while Oricorio-G is weak to Shadow Ball and needs a Special Defense boost to comfortably set up on Palossand. Flying-types: Oricorio-F and Braviary can capitalize on Palossand's difficulty in dealing damage to them to use it as setup fodder. Oricorio-G is weak to Shadow Ball but can use Quiver Dance to help itself get out of KO range and can target Palossand due to its low special bulk. Trick and Switcheroo: A Choice-lock is terrible for Palossand's ability to wall foes, so Rotom and Mesprit are very disruptive if they swap a Choice item onto it with Trick. Status: Toxic from Dudunsparce, Grafaiai, and Hisuian Qwilfish puts Palossand on a timer and makes it more reliant on using Shore Up, but neither of them tolerate burns from Palossand's Scorching Sands very well. Grafaiai can use Poison Touch, and Dudunsparce can use Poison Jab to fish for poisons on Palossand even if they drop Toxic. Taunt and Encore: Grafaiai and Whimsicott can use Encore to lock Palossand into a status move or weak move to exploit it, but they are weak to Scorching Sands and Sludge Bomb, respectively. Primeape can use Taunt to stop Palossand from setting up Stealth Rock or recovering but dislikes Scorching Sands. Sableye can irritate Palossand with Taunt or Encore."

  "Passimian": {
    "name": "Passimian",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Passimian is an excellent fast offensive pivot and revenge killer thanks to its strong STAB attacks, good physical bulk, Stealth Rock resistance, and resistance to priority moves like Accelerock from Lycanroc and Sucker Punch from Hisuian Decidueye and Brute Bonnet. Passimian OHKOes fast offensive threats like Lycanroc and Sneasel and KOes Typhlosion, Brute Bonnet, and Grafaiai after Stealth Rock damage. Knock Off makes Mesprit, Mismagius, and Oricorio-G unsafe switch-ins to Passimian, and it makes helpful progress by removing items from defensive checks like Palossand, Weezing, and Spiritomb. U-turn lets Passimian keep up momentum against switch-ins like Dipplin and Sableye. Earthquake is Passimian's best coverage move for Poison-types like Neutralizing Gas Weezing, Qwilfish, Hisuian Sneasel, and Muk. Gunk Shot OHKOes Whimsicott, is Passimian's best move against Dipplin, and keeps Passimian offensively relevant against Tera Fairy users like Snorlax, Dudunsparce, and Jolteon. Rock Slide hits Flying-types like Charizard, Cramorant, and Oricorio-F. Tera Fighting allows Passimian to outright OHKO offensive foes like Virizion and Typhlosion and 2HKO defensive foes like Hisuian Decidueye, Regirock, and Sandaconda after one layer of Spikes. Tera Dark improves Passimian's matchups against Mesprit and Farigiraf, powers up Knock Off to hurt Palossand and Spiritomb more, and denies Prankster-boosted moves from Grafaiai and Sableye. Defiant is Passimian's only viable ability, but it's useful for boosting Passimian against Intimidate Qwilfish formes and punishing Sticky Web and Defog Hisuian Decidueye. Passimian punishing Defog with Defiant and removing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off makes it a great team player for entry hazard-stacking teams including Qwilfish, Sandslash, or Hisuian Qwilfish. Passimian's momentum is greatly appreciated by wallbreakers like Typhlosion, Clawitzer, and Alolan Exeggutor. Passimian luring in physically defensive Pokemon like Sandaconda and Dipplin enables partners like Mesprit and Whimsicott to take advantage of them when Passimian pivots out with U-turn, and in turn, Passimian threatens Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton for them. Ghost-types like Palossand, Mismagius, and Oricorio-G can exploit Passimian locked into Close Combat, Earthquake, or Gunk Shot, so teammates like Dudunsparce, Snorlax, and Hisuian Qwilfish are great teammates. Likewise, Passimian appreciates specially offensive teammates like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Charizard that can exploit physically defensive Pokemon like Weezing and Dipplin that it lures in. Once Passimian can form pivot cores with Pokemon like Jolteon, Magneton, and Lanturn, it can trap foes in the vortex and wear down mutual Ground-type checks such as Palossand, Sandaconda, and Sandslash. Physical wallbreakers like Choice Band Sneasel, Glastrier, and Choice Band Floatzel can open up holes in defensive cores to pave the way for Passimian to clean up late-game. With a Choice Band equipped, Passimian 2HKOes non-Colbur Bery Palossand sets with Knock Off and physically defensive Sandaconda with Close Combat. However, Passimian's base 80 Speed leaves it very susceptible to faster offensive Pokemon like Jolteon, Charizard, and Whimsicott. Physically Defensive Pokemon: Dipplin and Sandaconda have the longevity and bulk to withstand repeated attacks from Passimian, and neither are particularly punished by Knock Off or its coverage moves. Gunk Shot can threaten Dipplin, but it suffers from poor accuracy and fails to 2HKO it. Weezing is a standout defensive check to Passimian between having great physical bulk, threatening to Will-O-Wisp Passimian, and punishing U-turn with Rocky Helmet. Ghost-types: Palossand, Sableye, and Spiritomb cause Passimian to lose momentum when it's locked into Close Combat, and all three can burn it. Spiritomb dislikes losing its Leftovers to Knock Off though. Mismagius and Oricorio-G can use Passimian to set up if it's locked into Close Combat or Earthquake, but neither of them can switch into Knock Off. Status: Will-O-Wisp from Rotom and Charizard debilitates Passimian, though they struggle to switch into its coverage moves safely. Paralysis leaves Passimian easily outsped and makes it poor speed control, so Regirock, Magneton, Porygon2, and Dudunsparce can punish Passimian trying to switch in on them with Thunder Wave or Glare. Faster Choice Scarf Users: Rotom, Typhlosion, and Mismagius can outspeed and deal significant damage to Passimian, though none of them switch into the combination of Close Combat and Knock Off safely. Fairy-types and Tera Fairy Pokemon: Whimsicott resists or takes neutral damage from most of Passimian's moves but must be wary of Gunk Shot, and Close Combat can 2HKO it after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fairy users like Mesprit, Mismagius, and Jolteon can take advantage of Passimian's limited coverage to take a hit from it and KO it at the cost of burning Terastallization. Even Pokemon vulnerable to Passimian such as Snorlax and Dudunsparce can use Tera Fairy to defensively flip their matchups and wall Passimian, opening opportunities for themselves to set up."

    "name": "Pawmot",
    "text": "Pawmot finds a niche over other Fighting-type wallbreakers such as both Paldean Tauros formes and Flamigo thanks to its great STAB combination that hits Pokemon like Galarian Articuno, Paldean Tauros-W, and Milotic; wide variety of coverage and utility options; great Speed; and useful abilities. It is also the only physical Electric-type in the tier. Knock Off provides utility by removing items from Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Gligar while also providing coverage for Ghost-types such as Decidueye and Golurk; however, Ice Punch provides coverage for the aforementioned Decidueye, Golurk, and Gligar while also doing more damage to other Pokemon like Colbur Berry or itemless Palossand and Altaria. Pawmot has a wide variety of options in for its final moveslot; Mach Punch gives Pawmot valuable priority against weakened setup sweepers and Choice Scarf users such as Zoroark, Paldean Tauros-W, and Staraptor. Rest should be paired with Natural Cure takes advantage of Pokemon that Pawmot forces to switch out like Bombirdier and Milotic. Finally, Volt Switch allows Pawmot to pivot against Pokemon like Goodra and Rotom-H and should be run with Heavy-Duty Boots. Life Orb allows Pawmot to achieve rolls such as having a chance to 2HKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro with Knock Off and OHKOing Delphox with Double Shock, but Heavy-Duty Boots lets it switch in more safely. Iron Fist boosts the power of Ice Punch and Mach Punch, but Natural Cure naturally pairs well with Rest and can allow Pawmot to recover from burn and poison. It should should be used when not running Ice Punch or Mach Punch. Volt Absorb can allow Pawmot to operate as an Electric immunity for its team, but this is generally not needed, and its other abilities are more viable. Tera Electric boosts the power of Double Shock, allowing Pawmot to OHKO Skuntank and Milotic, and makes the move spammable thanks to cancelling out the type loss from Double Shock. It also provides a useful Flying resistance, which is helpful against Pokemon like Scyther and Kilowattrel. Pawmot finds itself on offense and balance teams looking for a strong wallbreaker that can also function as a utility Pokemon with Knock Off, pivoting, and revenge killing. Pawmot struggles to break through certain physical walls such as Bellibolt and Mudsdale, so checks to these threats like Galarian Slowbro and Decidueye make excellent partners. Pawmot appreciates entry hazard control from Pokemon like Coalossal, Altaria, and Tatsugiri due to it switching out often due to Double Shock, especially if it is running Life Orb. Coalossal and Altaria can also sponge hits from faster foes that threaten Pawmot such as Galarian Slowbro and Ambipom, while Tatsugiri can form a potent wallbreaking core with Pawmot. In turn, Pawmot takes cares of their checks such as Paldean Tauros-W and Goodra. Pawmot's ability to revenge kill Pokemon like both Paldean Tauros formes, Delphox, and Bruxish means that walls checked by these threats like Bronzong, Copperajah, and Florges are excellent partners."

  "Pawniard": {
    "name": "Pawniard",
    "text": "Pawniard is a solid defensive Pokemon with the potential to win games. Swords Dance can be used against Pokemon such as on Vullaby, Gastly, and Snubbull. Sucker Punch is a strong STAB priority move that allows Pawniard to hit foes that would otherwise outspeed it such as Gastly and Snivy. Tera Flying lets Pawniard beat common Fighting- and Ground-types such as Mienfoo, Mudbray, and Trapinch that would otherwise stop its sweep; Tera Blast cleaves through common Pokemon such as the aforementioned Mienfoo and Foongus. Inner Focus is preferred over Defiant to avoid being flinched by Mienfoo's Fake Out, especially after Terastallizing. Pawniard's presence helps deal with Gastly and Gothita, assisting teammates such as Snivy, Mienfoo, and Timburr. Vullaby works well with Pawniard due to Pawniard's good matchup against both Snubbull and Glimmet. Mienfoo can U-turn into Pawniard and is a great partner for luring in Vullaby and Snubbull. While Pawniard can Terastallize to remove its Fighting weakness, teammates such as Snubbull, Koffing, and Gothita help against Mienfoo and Timburr without needing to Terastallize themsleves. Snubbull and Gastly can help Pawniard set up with Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp, respectively. Gastly deserves a special mention for often burning Stunky that would otherwise stop a Pawniard sweep. Pawniard is a solid utility Pokemon, pairing its excellent typing that allows it to check common Pokemon like Vullaby and Gastly with its useful support options in Stealth Rock and Thunder Wave. Thunder Wave keeps Pawniard from being too passive, and it combines well with Iron Head to paraflinch opposing Pokemon. Iron Head lets Pawniard hit both Mienfoo and Vullaby for neutral damage. Sucker Punch is a strong priority move that can pick off setup sweepers such as Shell Smash Shellder or Choice Scarf users like Hisuian Growlithe. Pawniard's EV spread gives it the bulk it needs to handle the aforementioned threats while keeping itself fast and strong enough to deal damage on its own. Pawniard struggles with Fighting- and Ground-type moves from Pokemon like Mienfoo and Mudbray respectively, so Pawniard can use Tera Flying to turn these attacks into a resistance and an immunity, respectively. Pawniard can complement Vullaby-weak Pokemon such as Foongus and Gastly, which struggle to deal with Vullaby's STAB moves. Both of these Pokemon provide useful benefits to Pawniard, with Foongus being able to check Mienfoo while Gastly can switch into the Ground-type moves that give Pawniard trouble. Slow and strong wallbreakers such as Mudbray and Eviolite Hisuian Growlithe can take advantage of Thunder Wave from Pawniard to become more threatening when opposing Pokemon are outpaced by them."

    "name": "Pelipper",
    "text": "Pelipper is OU's premier rain setter thanks to Drizzle, ability to safely bring in its offensive teammates with U-turn, and reliable recovery in Roost. Its perfectly-accurate STAB Hurricane threatens Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Grass-types like Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W— which are generally huge threats to rain teams—while dealing great neutral damage to Water-resistant targets like Hisuian Samurott and Dragapult. Surf threatens a number of common Stealth Rock setters such as Gliscor and Landorus-T with OHKOs in rain, while Knock Off cripples foes like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola, making them easier for Pelipper's teammates to break through. A Speed-reducing nature in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs gives Pelipper its slowest possible U-turn, allowing it to safely bring in teammates to make use of its rain. It also lets Pelipper underspeed uninvested Tyranitar and the niche Hippowdon, allowing its rain to override their sand in the lead matchup. A physically defensive EV spread lets Pelipper easily handle physical threats like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta, running enough Special Defense EVs to guarantee take on Enamorus's Moonblast after Stealth Rock. On the other hand, a specially defensive spread can be used to take less damage from special attackers that would otherwise take advantage of Pelipper's poor Special Defense, such as Gholdengo and Enamorus, as well as avoiding an OHKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor, while running enough Defense EVs to survive two Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge from full. Though Pelipper is rarely Terastallized, Tera Ground can be used to remove its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves from Raging Bolt and Zapdos and safely pivot out of them. Pelipper should be used exclusively on rain teams where it is commonly partnered with powerful wallbreakers like Barraskewda, which is greatly enabled by Swift Swim activation, and Raging Bolt, which benefits from Water-type Weather Ball to break through Ground-types. Due to Pelipper's weakness to Stealth Rock and that it can't afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots, it benefits greatly from Rapid Spin support from Iron Treads to allow it to repeatedly set rain. Because Damp Rock is needed to maximize the number of rain turns, Pelipper appreciates having a teammate that can switch into Knock Off, such as Kingambit, especially if its Air Balloon has been popped. Due to its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, Pelipper enjoys Ground-type teammates like Iron Treads that can easily switch into the likes of Raging Bolt. Pokemon like Air Balloon Kingambit that can help against Kyurem are also appreciated, as Pelipper is unable to defensively check it and rain teams tend to struggle against it."

    "text": "Thanks to Light Ball, Pikachu is a niche Imposter user that can break past less-sturdy Imposter-proofers, although it forgoes defensive utility in exchange. When Pikachu transforms, only the ability, item, and HP EVs listed here matter. The listed moves, non-HP EVs, and nature will very rarely see use: since Pikachu outspeeds all other Imposter users like Chansey, it is extremely rare that Pikachu is not transformed. Nevertheless, Volt Switch provides a reasonably strong pivoting option against opposing transformed Imposter users, which cause Pikachu's Imposter to fail, while Glare can paralyze threats to aid Pikachu later on. Healing Wish and Spikes both provide some utility if Pikachu is no longer needed. Since Pikachu is extremely frail, it can easily fall to any strong move from opposing threats it wants to transform into. Therefore, significant team support is needed to realize its potential. Paralysis spam through Nuzzle and Glare ensures Pikachu always outspeeds opposing threats like Mega Mewtwo X, and it can also generate free turns. Knock Off invalidates Pikachu, so Knock Off absorbers, such as Arceus with a held Plate are recommended. Bulky special walls like Ice Scales Arceus-Ground and Ho-Oh check Mega Diancie and Arceus-Ghost, which Pikachu cannot safely transform into: the former can OHKO with Extreme Speed, and the latter Imposter-proofs itself."

    "text": "These analyses were written before Pokemon Home's update for Generation 9. As a result, some of the content may now be outdated as we adjust for the new metagame. Uniquely among setup sweepers, Shell Smash + Stored Power gives Polteageist the power to KO most of the tier, the Speed to outspeed most of it, and a tool to plow through Unaware walls, all in one turn. Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash. Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls and wearing down Steel-types. In return, Dragapult can use its multi-hit attacks to threaten opposing Psychic Terrain teams."

Foul Play is a great anti-setup move that dissuades physical sweepers like Scizor, Ceruledge, and the Ogerpon formes from setting up. Substitute can be run over Foul Play, as it allows Porygon2 to block status from Toxapex and Amoonguss while also protecting itself from incoming threats like Great Tusk or Keldeo. However, doing so will make Porygon2 vulnerable into setup sweepers like Ogerpon-H and Gouging Fire due to not having Foul Play. Trace is the ideal ability for Porygon2 to copy Regenerator and Poison Heal from Toxapex and Gliscor, respectively. Trace also allows Porygon2 to copy Sword of Ruin, which helps it take hits from Chien-Pao better. Download can be run over Trace to make Porygon2 a bulky wallbreaker, making it notably effective in the Flying matchup by taking out Corviknight and Skarmory with ease. Blissey is the ideal partner for Porygon2, forming a strong defensive core by providing a switch-in to special threats like Flutter Mane, Dragapult, and Choice Specs Greninja, while also spreading paralysis with Thunder Wave. Blissey also provides utility in setting up Stealth Rock. Braviary provides entry hazard removal with Defog for Porygon2 while also checking Sneasler, Ogerpon-W, and Breloom with Brave Bird. In return, Porygon2 deals with Iron Boulder and Ceruledge for Braviary with Foul Play. Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is a nice teammate due to its Fighting immunity, and it can threaten important targets like Urshifu-R, Gholdengo, non-Choice Scarf Heatran, and Pecharunt with Shadow Ball and Focus Blast. Calm Mind Ursaluna-B is a great wallbreaker, KOing defensive threats like Galarian Weezing, Gouging Fire, and Heatran at +1. Ursaluna-B is also a Knock Off absorber for Porygon2 due its bulk and access to Moonlight. Choice Scarf Indeedee is a great revenge killer, taking out Fighting- and Poison-types like mixed Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Clodsire, and it can use Healing Wish to bring Porygon2 back to full health if it gets weakened. Ditto becomes a great reverse sweeper for Porygon2 by transforming into sweepers like Gouging Fire and Chien-Pao. Cinccino not only removes hazards and boosts its stats with Tidy Up, but also threatens a lot of specially bulky Pokemon with Bullet Seed, Rock Blast, and Triple Axel for Porygon2, most notably Articuno and Swampert. Cinccino can also run a Choice Band set to potentially wallbreak, letting it OHKO Clodsire with Triple Axel. Terapagos can run an offensive utility set with Rapid Spin for Porygon2, but it can also become a fierce setup sweeper with Calm Mind and Tera Starstorm. Terapagos notably threatens Steel-types like Excadrill and Heatran with Earth Power, which Porygon2 appreciates."

    "name": "Primarina",
    "text": "Assault Vest Primarina is a great special wall and slow pivot while being a remarkable offensive threat itself. Assault Vest allows Primarina to tank strong super effective hits like Serperior's Leaf Storm and Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, along with the ability to check threats like Walking Wake, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant. Surf and Moonblast hit the majority of the metagame for neutral or super effective damage, where Surf hits the Steel- and Fire-types such as Gholdengo and Cinderace that resist Moonblast, and Moonblast hits Dragon-types such as Dragapult that resist Surf. Flip Turn allows Primarina to slow pivot a teammate in after a foe has attacked, and it can also be used on predicted switches to gain momentum. Psychic Noise blocks healing from special walls like Blissey, Clodsire, and Clefable, allowing Primarina to chip them down for itself and its partners. 176 Speed EVs let Primarina outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna, while the remaining HP EVs allow Primarina to reach feats such as surviving Protosynthesis Thunderbolt from Raging Bolt, +1 Speed Booster Energy Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, +2 Gliscor's Earthquake, and two Heavy Slams from Zamazenta. Tera Steel turns two of Primarina's major weaknesses, Poison and Grass, into an immunity and a resistance, respectively. This can be useful against moves like Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Iron Moth's Sludge Wave. Tera Steel also provides a resistance to Stealth Rock, letting it pivot around more freely. However, Tera Steel negatively affects its matchup into Fire- and Fighting-types like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Tera Grass aids Primarina's matchup into Ogerpon-W and can help it against Raging Bolt in a pinch too; however, do note that Tera Grass still leaves it vulnerable to Galarian Slowking. Assault Vest Primarina is best used on bulky offense teams that appreciate a Pokemon that has both offensive and defensive prowess, generally teams that are particularly weak to special attackers. Landorus-T provides Intimidate and checks the physical attackers that Primarina struggles with like Kingambit and Great Tusk. Great Tusk is another great teammate, as it provides entry hazard removal and checks Galarian Slowking, which tends to threaten Primarina. In return, Primarina can handle threats like Darkrai and Walking Wake. Kingambit and Roaring Moon appreciate support from Primarina who can switch in on and hit Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta super effectively with STAB Moonblast. Furthermore, both of these Pokemon help check Galarian Slowking for Primarina, along with resisting Grass-type attacks. Gholdengo appreciates Primarina's ability to check Fire-types like Cinderace and Heatran, as well as Walking Wake. Primarina struggles with Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom, so it's essential to have checks to these such as Rillaboom, Cinderace, and Kingambit. Cinderace, aside from resisting Grass-type attacks, can also help with hazard removal with Court Change, allowing Primarina to switch in more often. Dragapult and Cinderace can form a great pivoting core with Primarina, and they can also spread burn in order to help improve Primarina's matchup against physical attackers like Great Tusk. Primarina is a fierce sweeper that can use its STAB moves, combined with Calm Mind, to muscle through most enemies. Primarina can choose between Surf for perfect accuracy or Hydro Pump for greater power that lets it 2HKO Galarian Slowking at +1. Substitute lets Primarina grab more Calm Mind boosts while slower Pokemon try to cripple Primarina with a status effect, like Toxic from Clodsire, Thunder Wave from Galarian Slowking, or Salt Cure from Garganacl, as well as easing prediction. It can use Psychic Noise to block healing from defensive Pokemon, including Slack Off from Galarian Slowking, Recover from Clodsire, and Wish from Alomomola, thus making them easier to beat. Encore lets Primarina lock opposing Pokemon into moves they don't care for, which can be especially effective in shutting down Kingambit, forcing switches that can give it more opportunities to boost or attack. As for items, Primarina has good choices as well; its item can be Leftovers to grab more healing, pairing well with Substitute, while Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to avoid taking damage from entry hazards. Custap Berry allows Primarina to get one last attack before fainting, which can be useful in luring in and surprising Pokemon that want to use Primarina as momentum. 176 Speed EVs allow Primarina to outspeed Adamant Kingambit. Tera Steel lets Primarina stay in and tank attacks from Grass-, Poison-, and Steel-types and hit them back hard; examples of these moves include Wood Hammer from Rillaboom, Sludge Wave from Iron Moth, and Make It Rain from Gholdengo. Its biggest claim to fame is being able to resist Galarian Slowking's STAB moves, turning one of its worst matchups into a setup opportunity. Tera Poison does similar to Steel, but it lets Primarina resist Fighting-types, like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, and absorbing Toxic Spikes is a nice addition as well. Finally, Tera Water lets Primarina deal even more damage, which allows it to achieve some thresholds like having great chances to 2HKO Ting-Lu and going from a 4HKO to a 3HKO against Galarian Slowking, both with an unboosted Surf. This Primarina set excels in hyper offensive structures as an early-game monster thanks to its good damage output and Calm Mind, which allow Primarina to destroy Kingambit, Heatran, Zamazenta, Clodsire, and many others. Kingambit loves the fact that Primarina can beat some of its counters like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Dondozo. Kingambit, in return, can beat Galarian Slowking and Blissey. The same applies to Iron Valiant, which appreciates Primarina's ability to counter Pokemon like Gholdengo and Skeledirge that can otherwise give it trouble. Thanks to Primarina's good matchup against defensive Ground-types like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, Pokemon like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt appreciate the help sweeping late-game. Primarina struggles against Pokemon that can either shut it down fast with super effective moves, like Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom, strong physical offense from the likes of offensive Great Tusk, or sturdy special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Blissey. Primarina loves the support from Landorus-T, which can scare away special walls with Earthquake, absorb Raging Bolt's Electric-type moves, support Primarina with Intimidate, allowing Primarina to take on strong physical offense, gain momentum from U-turn, which Landorus-T can easily obtain from common switch-ins like Gliscor, Alomomola, and Skarmory, and set up entry hazards to nab some good damage thresholds, like greatly improving the chance for Primarina to 2HKO bulky variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit with unboosted Surf. Iron Treads is another Ground-type that Primarina appreciates for its ability to check Galarian Slowking; it also provides Stealth Rock support, as well as Rapid Spin to clear the field of hazards. Another great partner is Rillaboom, since it also scares away the aforementioned Galarian Slowking and Blissey, as well as Great Tusk, and provides Primarina with extra healing from Grassy Surge. Dragapult is also a good teammate for Primarina because of its ability to check Ogerpon-W, spread status that can help Primarina either tank or outspeed opposing Pokemon more easily, and use U-turn to bring Primarina safely into the battle. Darkrai makes a good pairing due to its ability to beat Galarian Slowking and really appreciates Primarina's ability to beat both Clodsire and Iron Valiant. Offensive hazard setters like Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S bring hazard pressure that can help Primarina break through walls more easily. Galarian Slowking provides pivoting with Chilly Reception and offensive pressure with Future Sight. Thanks to a great typing and solid overall bulk, Primarina is one of the most dangerous set up sweepers in OU, capable of checking and setting up on offensive Pokemon like Zamazenta, Weavile, and Walking Wake. Calm Mind makes Primarina able to threaten the opposing team while also making itself harder to KO for potential revenge killers like Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Psychic Noise can be used in combination with Liquid Voice to cripple defensive switch-ins that would be able to beat it one-on-one, such as Dondozo, Unaware Clefable, and Clodsire. Surf is also an option to put more pressure on offensive teams due to it's higher Base Power while being run with Torrent, which can power it up in a pinch. It notably is useful against Gholdengo as well as threatening the 2HKO on bulky Kingambit after a Calm Mind. Substitute prevents Primarina from being affected by status moves such as Thunder Wave from Clefable and Toxic from Clodsire. It also punishes switches that Primarina forces and allows it to scout opposing Pokemon. Substitute is also useful to avoid being revenge killed by Rillaboom and Meowscarada while blocking Trick from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gholdengo. It is also a safe way to bring Primarina to Torrent range. This EV spread ensures that it outspeeds uninvested Clefable and avoids the 2HKO from Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake's Hydro Steam under sun. Both Tera Poison and Steel flip the matchup against Grass-types like Meowscarada, Serperior, and Rillaboom while also turning the tables on Galarian Slowking. With Tera Steel, Primarina resists Gholdengo's Make it Rain and can beat it one-on-one. It can also absorb Galarian Slowking's Future Sight and set up on Hatterene and Clefable. With Tera Poison, Primarina gains a great neutral typing against threats like Iron Moth while preserving its resistance to Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Primarina fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the natural defensive utility that Primarina brings to the table while also being a threatening sweeper itself. Primarina can support teammates such as Weavile, Rillaboom, and Great Tusk by switching in on Zamazenta, Weavile, and Walking Wake. Rillaboom is particulary good, as Primarina covers threats to it like Cinderace, Dragonite, and Skeledirge while appreciating the extra healing of Grassy Terrain. Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Weavile can threaten Pokemon that would otherwise be annoying for Primarina, such as Galarian Slowking, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior, respectively. Due to Primarina's lack of reliable recovery, it struggles against entry hazards, especially hazard stacking teams. The aforementioned Great Tusk helps it by removing them with Rapid Spin while also being a switch-in to Kingambit that can threaten a weakened Primarina out. Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Serperior can safely switch into Primarina and threaten it with powerful attacks, forcing it to Terastallize or switch out; Pokemon that can switch in on these threats like Kingambit, Rillaboom, Skarmory, and Corviknight make for great teammates. Kingambit is also a huge help, as it beats one of the most common checks to Primarina in Galarian Slowking while appreciating Primarina's ability to safely switch in and beat Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Skarmory. Primarina becomes an effective pivot thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots allowing it to avoid entry hazard damage, giving it more opportunities to switch in and pivot. Surf and Moonblast combined hit the entire metagame either neutrally or super effectively, and Flip Turn allows Primarina to pivot out of bad matchups and predicted switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and Assault Vest Rillaboom. Encore can render defensive and setup Pokemon useless, locking them into unfavorable moves, such as Corviknight's Roost, Dondozo's Curse, Kingambit's Swords Dance, and Roaring Moon's Dragon Dance after it has Terastallized. 176 Speed EVs are run to outspeed Adamant Kingambit. Tera Steel allows Primarina to stay in on Galarian Slowking and resist Grass-type moves from Pokemon like Rillaboom and Meowscarada. Tera Ghost lets Primarina more comfortably take on both Zamazenta and Dragonite. Primarina fits best on bulky offense teams that want a pivot with considerable offensive pressure. Kingambit fits nicely with Primarina, since it also excels on those playstyles and beats Primarina's most commonly used check in Galarian Slowking. It appreciates Primarina having good matchups against its most common checks in Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Primarina can support teammates such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Rillaboom by being able to temporarily switch into Pokemon like Walking Wake, Weavile, and Cinderace. In return, Great Tusk can remove entry hazards for Primarina in case its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed. Dragonite can break through Primarina checks like Clodsire, Rillaboom, Galarian Slowking, and Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom can provide Grassy Terrain recovery. Primarina greatly appreciates Darkrai being able to beat Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, and in return, Primarina is able to take on prominent Darkrai checks like Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and non-Water Absorb Clodsire. Hisuian Samurott is a great partner for Primarina, since it naturally fits on bulky offense teams because it can punch holes through defensive cores while also stacking hazards, and Primarina supports it by being able to switch into Zamazenta, which would otherwise set up on Hisuian Samurott. On hazard stacking teams, Gholdengo is an amazing partner, since it beats Galarian Slowking while also preventing hazard removal from Great Tusk and Corviknight. Pivots like Landorus-T and Iron Crown are able to form a pivoting core with Primarina on bulky offense teams, synergizing well thanks to their complementary typings, offensive presence to pressure opposing teams, and ability to gain momentum even when faced with bad matchups. Landorus-T is able to switch into Electric-types like Raging Bolt, and Iron Crown is able to switch into Galarian Slowking and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Raging Bolt appreciates Primarina as a partner, since it's able to take out all the Ground-types that pester it like Ting-Lu and Clodsire, and in return, Raging Bolt can threaten Pokemon that are able to take Primarina's attacks such as specially defensive Corviknight. Raging Bolt's Thunderclap is also able to revenge kill faster offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and Deoxys-S, making up for the core's lack of Speed and strong priority."

    "text": "Quaxly is a notable Rapid Spin user in LC due to its access to reliable recovery and good matchup into entry hazard setters like Pawniard and Glimmet; it can also double as a capable sweeper thanks to Moxie. Aqua Cutter gives up some power compared to Liquidation but does not make contact, which avoids activating Greavard's Fluffy and Voltorb's Static, and removes the risk of activating Pawniard's Defiant with a Defense drop. Aqua Jet is STAB priority that OHKOs Hisuian Growlithe, while Brave Bird provides super effective coverage versus Grass- and Fighting-types like Toedscool and Foongus. Encore can lock opposing Pokemon into unfavorable moves, such as weak setup moves, gaining momentum for Quaxly's team. Quaxly can use Tera Grass for a better matchup versus Electric- and Grass-types as well as a valuable immunity to Spore from Foongus and Toedscool. Tera Flying can also be used with Brave Bird to turn Quaxly into a more potent offensive threat. Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock, such as Hisuian Growlithe, Wingull, and Nymble, are great partners for Quaxly, as they appreciate the removal of entry hazards to be used at their full potential. Foongus is another good partner, as it can safely switch into Grass-types and provides valuable Spore support. Pokemon such as Toedscool and Wattrel check Electric-types for Quaxly."

  "Qwilfish": {
    "name": "Qwilfish",
    "text": "As a result of its defensive profile synergizing well with its threatening attacks and serviceable Speed tier, Qwilfish is an incredibly versatile Choice Scarf user that can surprise opponents expecting a defensive set. Choice Scarf Qwilfish provides both offensive and defensive value, revenge killing weakened foes while using Intimidate to switch into attackers in a pinch. Gunk Shot sets Qwilfish apart from other Water-type attackers, letting it dismantle Grass-types like Hisuian Decidueye, Alolan Exeggutor, and Virizion. Liquidation is a similarly powerful STAB attack that helps it revenge kill weakened foes like Grafaiai and Sneasel. Flip Turn lets Qwilfish quickly pivot into a partner that can better handle walls like Orthworm and Weezing that switch into it. These forced switches also provide Qwilfish with the opportunity to lay down Spikes, allowing it to bluff a defensive set on certain occasions only for it to surprise the opponent with a revenge kill later on in the game. Barb Barrage is an alternative fourth move, being a more reliably accurate Poison-type attack that can also poison and thus wear down switch-ins like Regirock and Poliwrath. Lastly, Destiny Bond trades KOs with boosted threats like Braviary and Glastrier to prevent sweeps. Offense teams that need a combination of an offensive and defensive presence love the versatility provided by Qwilfish. Being able to finish off weakened Pokemon synergizes well with wallbreakers that specialize in dealing heavier damage, including Whimsicott, Magneton, and Glastrier. Finishing off foes assists setup sweepers like Oricorio-G, Frosmoth, and Virizion. Qwilfish's defensive utility means that it can still switch into wallbreakers like Hisuian Decidueye and can support extremely frail pivots like Jolteon, Rotom, and Grafaiai. While it primarily focuses on revenge killing, Qwilfish's pivoting with Flip Turn can result in lots of chip damage in tandem with entry hazards set up by Orthworm, Sandslash, or Mesprit. The latter two Pokemon, alongside other Knock Off users like Sneasel and Passimian, can remove Heavy-Duty Boots to ensure hazards help chip down foes. More defensively oriented teams also feature walls like Articuno and Snorlax that greatly appreciate Flip Turn switching them in. Ghost-types like Palossand and Sableye can block Rapid Spin and wall Toxicroak, one of Qwilfish's prominent checks. Despite competition from other Swords Dance users in the tier, Qwilfish can still consistently set up to sweep thanks to its defensive typing and access to Intimidate. Qwilfish can turn the tables on would-be checks like Orthworm and Regirock by setting up Swords Dance in front of them. Liquidation and Gunk Shot are two powerful STAB moves that take out walls like Sandaconda, Snorlax, and Dipplin. Aqua Jet allows it to get the jump on faster foes like Sneasel, Jolteon, and Charizard, typically grabbing a KO after a boost and enough chip damage. This also makes Qwilfish an apt revenge killer, with Tera Water making Aqua Jet even stronger after a Swords Dance boost. Leftovers supports Qwilfish on top of its already great ability and typing, granting it significantly more staying power than other setup sweepers. Swords Dance Qwilfish provides a bulky dynamic to offensive teams looking to overwhelm foes with a variety of strong attacks. Pivots like Articuno, Mesprit, and Rotom can effectively bring in Qwilfish while also chipping walls like Regirock and Dudunsparce. Other wallbreakers like Toxicroak, Grafaiai, and Whimsicott can chip down the opposing team. to make its sweep easier. A more aggressive team with several sweepers like Virizion, Sneasel, and Frosmoth can let Qwilfish help overwhelm opposing teams. More balanced teams can also effectively use Swords Dance Qwilfish as a way to surprise opponents expecting a more defensive set. Since Qwilfish is purely invested in its offense, it's still important to support Qwilfish with a strong defensive backbone including walls such as Snorlax, Hisuian Decidueye, and Sandslash. Entry hazard setters like Sandaconda, Palossand, and Orthworm also chip down foes over the course of a longer game, possibly giving Qwilfish the chance to OHKO Snorlax after a boost. As one of the most splashable Pokemon in ZU, Qwilfish threatens to deter physical wallbreakers with Intimidate, making it a premier Spikes setter with the longevity to set multiple layers up. Furthermore, by Terastallizing into a Ground-type, Qwilfish can surprise Electric-type foes, including Rotom and Jolteon. Flip Turn hits prominent Pokemon like Sandaconda, Oricorio, and Rhydon for super effective damage while allowing a teammate to switch in. Barb Barrage may hit Pokemon such as Hisuian Decidueye and Virizion for super effective damage, but switch-ins also dislike this move due to the poison chance. It can run a variety of moves for its fourth moveslot, but Taunt's capability of shutting down utility moves such as Recover and Defog make it the most preferable. Nevertheless, Pain Split is a valid alternative if one wants a semi-recovery option to increase its longevity, which is especially valuable against foes with high HP like Snorlax and Dudunsparce. Toxic and Thunder Wave are also good options to more reliably inflict status. Rocky Helmet's chip damage makes Qwilfish a fantastic punisher of spammable contact moves like U-turn and Knock Off, but Heavy-Duty Boots greatly helps Qwilfish's longevity. Qwilfish's versatility makes it a seamless fit onto many team styles, but balance and bulky offense teams especially love its entry hazard setting and defensive pivoting. By chipping down foes with its STAB combination while laying down layers of Spikes, late-game cleaners like Passimian and Mesprit can more easily take down worn out opponents. These threats also boast the ability to pivot, creating VoltTurn cores that bolster offensive pressure. By pivoting with Flip Turn, Qwilfish can safely bring in frail attackers like Jolteon, Dodrio, and Typhlosion, which can all wreak havoc when they're given the chance to enter the field healthy. Ghost-types like Oricorio-G and Mismagius are especially nice partners, since they provide an immunity to Rapid Spin to keep Spikes on the field. Grass-types like Hisuian Decidueye, Virizion, and Whimsicott also provide type synergy with Qwilfish, as their offensive and defensive strengths are bolstered by Qwilfish's overall utility. Qwilfish's defensive profile also makes life easier for bulky partners like Snorlax and Articuno, as Qwilfish can switch into threatening Fighting-types like Passimian, Hisuian Decidueye, and Hitmonchan. In return, those walls can more easily take on the special attacks that may scare Qwilfish out. Other defensive Pokemon like Sandaconda and Palossand can reinforce a team's physical backbone while also being immune to Volt Switch users that threaten to OHKO Qwilfish. Qwilfish can Terastallize into a Ghost-type to block Rapid Spin attempts, but this makes it significantly weaker against Pokémon like Oricorio-G and Hisuian Qwilfish. Defensive Qwilfish sets can run Leftovers to heal gradually throughout a game, but this recovery is often mitigated by having to switch into entry hazards multiple times per game. Qwilfish can strengthen its offensive potential by equipping a Choice Band, unleashing strong Aqua Jets and Flip Turns while still switching into a variety of physical attacks. Psychic-types: Strong Psychic-type attackers in ZU, including Mesprit, Veluza, and Indeedee-F, can threaten to outspeed and knock out Qwilfish. While these Pokemon don't love switching in against Qwilfish, they can afford to take a hit and deal massive damage in return. Electric-types: Although their low bulk makes them struggle to switch into Qwilfish's attacks, Electric-type pivots like Rotom and Morpeko can outspeed and threaten an OHKO on Qwilfish. This can sometimes force opponents to use Terastallization on Qwilfish, limiting their offensive resources late-game. There additionally are Electric-type attackers with strong defensive profiles, such as Magneton and Vikavolt, that can switch into Qwilfish effectively. Ground-types and Ground-type coverage: Qwilfish's Water-type STAB attacks may threaten out many Ground-types, but strong Ground-type attackers like Sandaconda, Palossand, and Sandslash can retaliate with super effective damage of their own. Many wallbreakers also pack Ground-type attacks that can heavily chip a Qwilfish looking to switch in, including Passimian, Glastrier, and Charizard. Special Attackers: Due to its lack of Special Defense, Qwilfish struggles to handle hits from special wallbreakers like Rotom, Mismagius, and Clawitzer. On the other hand, setup sweepers like Oricorio-G, Frosmoth, and Dudunsparce can set up in its face, although they don't enjoy getting poisoned. Entry Hazards: While Qwilfish can feel like a defensive stalwart, its lack of reliable recovery makes it especially prone to Stealth Rock and Spikes. If setters like Palossand, Orthworm, and Regirock can keep hazards on the field, Qwilfish can later get overwhelmed by wallbreakers it would normally check efficiently."

  "Qwilfish-Hisui": {
    "name": "Qwilfish-Hisui",
    "text": "Hisuian Qwilfish's Eviolite-boosted bulk, Intimidate, and great typing make it an amazing defensive utility Pokemon. Thanks to its typing, Hisuian Qwilfish can check specially offensive setup sweepers like Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Mismagius thanks to its immunity to Stored Power and lack of weaknesses to common special coverage moves like Draining Kiss and Dazzling Gleam. Barb Barrage is a great STAB move for Hisuian Qwilfish, as it wears down Pokemon with its high chance to poison and powers up when its targets are poisoned, and walls like Regirock and Palossand do not appreciate being poisoned. Barb Barrage is great against the Grass-types Hisuian Qwilfish checks, such as Hisuian Decidueye, Virizion, and Dipplin, as well as Fairy-type Pokemon like Whimsicott and Tera Fairy Mesprit and Mismagius. Crunch is a stronger STAB move for foes that aren't yet poisoned and has great coverage against other specially offensive threats like Mesprit, Oricorio-G, and Mismagius. Hisuian Qwilfish's excellent defensive profile gives it plenty of opportunities to set up Spikes as it threatens out Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Dipplin and pressures the most common hazard remover: Hisuian Decidueye. Toxic more reliably statuses foes compared to Barb Barrage, and Toxic poison is deadlier to walls like Dudunsparce, Regirock, and Palossand. Taunt lets Hisuian Qwilfish shut down opposing defensive Pokemon like Dudunsparce, Orthworm, and Weezing to prevent them from recovering or supporting their teams. Haze removes boosts from specially offensive setup sweepers that Hisuian Qwilfish checks, such as Mesprit, Farigiraf, and Virizion. Intimidate lets Hisuian Qwilfish work as a stopgap to physical attackers like Grafaiai, Swords Dance Virizion, and Swords Dance Qwilfish. Tera Dragon lends Hisuian Qwilfish new resistances to Electric, Fire, and Water to make it a better check to special attackers like Typhlosion, Jolteon, and Cramorant. Hisuian Qwilfish fits on bulky offensive teams looking to compress a solid defensive backbone and entry hazard setter into one slot. Offensive Pokemon like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Jolteon are great beneficiaries of Spikes set by Hisuian Qwilfish, as common checks to them like Snorlax and Regirock are prone to being overwhelmed by residual damage. Roar Articuno and Dragon Tail Dipplin and Dudunsparce can put Spikes set by Hisuian Qwilfish to good use by quickly racking up residual damage. Sandslash's Earthquake and Rapid Spin are very threatening to Hisuian Qwilfish, so good checks to Sandslash like Hisuian Decidueye, Dipplin, and Orthworm help Hisuian Qwilfish, and Palossand can spinblock for Hisuian Qwilfish as a bonus. Grass-types in particular, such as Whimsicott, Virizion, and Shaymin, make great partners for Hisuian Qwilfish by covering its sole weakness to Ground. Hisuian Qwilfish can struggle against specially offensive foes like Jolteon, Typhlosion, and Charizard, so special walls like Snorlax, Regirock, and Dudunsparce can help deal with these foes while appreciating the residual damage that Hisuian Qwilfish spreads. Several physical attackers like Hisuian Decidueye and Sneasel ignore Intimidate while others like Passimian and Braviary can benefit from it, so physical sponges like Dipplin, Regirock, Palossand, and Sandaconda cover these foes for Hisuian Qwilfish. Teammates such as Passimian, Hisuian Decidueye, and Regirock appreciate Hisuian Qwilfish for checking special attackers like Mesprit, Mismagius, and Farigiraf for them."

    "text": "Calm Mind Raging Bolt is one of the metagame's top setup sweepers and wallbreakers. Its natural bulk and unique typing not only allows it to check common offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and Cinderace, but also to gain multiple entry points and setup opportunities as well. On top of a potent STAB combination that hits most of the metagame at least neutrally, its signature move Thunderclap prevents Raging Bolt's sweep from being cut short by faster threats and opposing priority users like Enamorus, Walking Wake, and Kingambit and lets it act as a revenge killer, too. Dragon Pulse is preferred for its consistent damage output, but Draco Meteor can be used to propel Raging Bolt's niche as a wallbreaker further, letting it overwhelm checks like Ting-Lu and Clodsire much more easily and netting benchmarks such as OHKOing defensive Landorus-T and Dragonite through Multiscale, all after a Calm Mind. A reliable Electric-type STAB move lets Raging Bolt prevent foes like Primarina, Gholdengo, and Calm Mind Enamorus from setting up freely and makes it less vulnerable to Encore users like Iron Valiant and Hisuian Samurott. Thunderbolt's consistency is preferred in this regard, but other options can be used as well. Discharge allows Raging Bolt to potentially cripple specially defensive walls like Galarian Slowking and slow down faster threats like Gholdengo, Darkrai, and Zamazenta, which helps to reduce its reliance on Thunderclap. Exclusively on rain teams, the stronger option in Thunder can also be used instead for similar reasons. Raging Bolt can lean towards the weather further by running Weather Ball instead if used on either a sun or rain team; it allows Raging Bolt to hit Iron Treads super effectively, with rain Weather Ball pressuring Raging Bolt's other Ground-type checks like Gliscor and Landorus-T more reliably, while sun Weather Ball cleanly OHKOes even bulky Kingambit and Gholdengo unboosted, all at the expense of the ability to immediately threaten Calm Mind Primarina. Alternatively, Taunt can be used to let Raging Bolt overwhelm walls like Blissey and Toxic Galarian Slowking. Booster Energy provides Raging Bolt with a damage boost, letting it reach feats such as OHKOing Iron Valiant with +1 Thunderclap after a layer of Spikes and specially defensive Gliscor with +1 Draco Meteor, as well as having significant rolls to 2HKO Clodsire with Draco Meteor. Leftovers gives it more longevity to set up more easily and further take advantage of its defensive profile. Air Balloon is another option to prevent revenge killing attempts from its Ground-type checks like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu. Tera Fairy gives Raging Bolt an immunity to Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult and opposing Raging Bolt that don't fear its Thunderclap; it is also generally a good neutral typing against foes like Weavile and Iron Valiant. Tera Flying can be used for an outright immunity to Ground, letting it flip its matchup against Great Tusk and Landorus-T; this can be combined with Taunt to beat bulky Ground-type checks like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Tera Ghost is also an option with Taunt to beat Blissey one-on-one and give offensive teams an emergency check to IronPress Zamazenta. An EV spread of 64 HP / 28 Def / 252 SpA / 164 Spe is an alternative option; it runs enough Speed to get the jump on Gliscor, with the extra bulk letting Raging Bolt survive Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk's Headlong Rush from full, though this significantly worsens its matchup against opposing Raging Bolt. Raging Bolt fits on a variety of offensive teams, ranging from hyper offense to weather-based archetypes in sun and rain. It pairs well with other strong special attackers like Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Darkrai; on top of keeping up the pressure against the opposition, they can work with Raging Bolt to wear down and overwhelm shared checks like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Zamazenta are similarly important, as they can threaten out the aforementioned special walls and force damage against Landorus-T and opposing Great Tusk; some of these physical attackers can even switch into the Ground-types, and Raging Bolt uses their checks like Skarmory, Alomomola, and Dondozo as entry points and setup opportunities. Rillaboom also deserves a special mention; on top of providing Grassy Terrain to increase Raging Bolt's longevity and let it stomach Earthquake from foes like Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, Rillaboom can also bring Raging Bolt in safely via U-turn against switch-ins like Moltres, Corviknight, and Zapdos for setup opportunities. Entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S, Hisuian Samurott, Landorus-T, and Glimmora are highly appreciated, as hazards help put foes and especially its checks into KO range, with Landorus-T also capable of switching into Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and opposing Landorus-T that threaten Raging Bolt out; in return, Raging Bolt can take advantage of and pressure common hazard removal Pokemon like Corviknight and Cinderace to maintain said hazards. Raging Bolt can benefit from Drought users like Torkoal and Ninetales; the sun allows Raging Bolt to freely forgo Booster Energy and gives it the option to run Weather Ball. Raging Bolt also synergizes well with other sun wallbreakers; Walking Wake can exploit Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Gliscor while assisting Raging Bolt in pressuring Galarian Slowking and Blissey. This is especially strong because going for Tera Water to deal with Walking Wake makes them vulnerable to Raging Bolt. Roaring Moon and Great Tusk can complement Raging Bolt's breaking power by dealing with its special walls, and they overwhelm shared checks like Landorus-T and Great Tusk, with Raging Bolt handling the likes of Skarmory, Alomomola, and Tera Water Gliscor in return, especially since Roaring Moon can bring it safely via U-turn. Raging Bolt can also be used on rain teams, benefiting from Pelipper's Drizzle to run options like Weather Ball and Thunder. It forms a great core with Barraskewda, as Barraskewda can position Raging Bolt against its bulky Water-type checks like Alomomola and Tera Water Garganacl via Flip Turn; in return, Barraskewda alongside other rain wallbreakers like Overqwil can pressure and overwhelm Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Iron Treads for Raging Bolt. Defensively, Raging Bolt can check Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, which are otherwise problematic for rain teams, while Pelipper is capable of switching into Ground-types like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads that force Raging Bolt out. Though more niche, Raging Bolt can also fit on other hyper offense structures. Dual screens setters like Deoxys-S, Alolan Ninetales, and Grimmsnarl provide Raging Bolt with an easier time setting up against even super effective hits and prevent it from being revenge killed by foes like Weavile, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Sticky Web from Ribombee can slow down would-be revenge killers like Great Tusk, minimizing the risk of Thunderclap mindgames against foes like Encore Iron Valiant and Substitute Iron Moth. Raging Bolt acts as a powerful offensive pivot and revenge killer that can also provide defensive utility thanks to its solid natural bulk and good typing. Thunderclap is one of the strongest options for priority in the metagame, allowing Raging Bolt to overcome its lackluster Speed tier and act as a strong revenge killer against the likes of Ogerpon-W, Enamorus, Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Kingambit. Volt Switch makes Raging Bolt hard to pin down, allowing it to pivot on and wear down specially defensive walls such as Galarian Slowking, Iron Crown, and Blissey as they switch in. Draco Meteor is a viable alternative to Dragon Pulse for more immediate power, hitting some benchmarks like OHKOing opposing Raging Bolt and having a chance to OHKO bulky Great Tusk in exchange for a severe Special Attack drop. Taunt allows Raging Bolt to more effectively deal with special walls by stopping recovery attempts from the likes of Blissey and Clodsire and blocking utility moves from Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking. Other options include Thunderbolt for a consistent Electric-type STAB move, 2HKOing neutral targets such as Clefable after little prior chip damage, defensive Zapdos, and Gholdengo while not forcing Raging Bolt to switch out, and Weather Ball on weather teams or alongside Galarian Slowking for alternative Ice-type coverage. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Raging Bolt to hit the field multiple times without worrying about entry hazards, which is especially good on teams that rely on ignoring hazards altogether, but Choice Specs is a viable alternative on teams with reliable hazard control options, hitting important damage benchmarks including 2HKOing Garganacl with Thunderbolt, OHKOing specially defensive Gliscor, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W with Draco Meteor, and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Galarian Slowking with Draco Meteor, though it makes Raging Bolt unable to run Taunt. Tera Fairy allows Raging Bolt to turn the tables on matchups like Iron Defense Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, Kyurem, Walking Wake, and Great Tusk as well as giving it the option to run Tera Blast in order to hit Ting-Lu and Great Tusk super effectively. Another option is Tera Flying, granting an even better matchup against the likes of Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu, though it gives Raging Bolt some problematic weaknesses against opposing Raging Bolt, Zapdos, Weavile, and Meowscarada. Raging Bolt fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, which appreciate its ability to pivot in and out of the field while dealing heavy damage and threatening boosted sweepers with its priority move. Raging Bolt can form great offensive cores when it's paired with other offensive pivots like Ogerpon, which can apply pressure with U-turn in a similar fashion to Raging Bolt's Volt Switch, punish Ground-types with its strong Grass-type STAB moves, remove items with Knock Off to accumulate entry hazard damage, and punish setup moves with Encore. Embody Aspect's Speed boost also helps Ogerpon cover for Raging Bolt's poor Speed against the likes of Great Tusk, Darkrai, and Dragapult. In return, Ogerpon appreciates Raging Bolt's help in pressuring physically defensive Pokémon such as Zapdos, Moltres, and Corviknight. Ogerpon-W is even more effective at dealing with Ground-types, trading Ogerpon's ability to hold an item and boost its Speed for a harder-to-resist STAB combination and wallbreaking power, pressuring defensive cores such as Sinistcha + Gliscor and Galarian Slowking + Corviknight more easily with pivoting support from Raging Bolt. Meowscarada offers a stronger U-turn and Knock Off as well as an even better Speed tier, especially with Choice Scarf variants acting as a revenge killer for faster threats such as Roaring Moon. Weavile has a strong Knock Off as well, and its Ice Shard complements Thunderclap perfectly against offensive cores, hitting Dragon-type threats Raging Bolt struggles with like Roaring Moon and Dragonite. Hisuian Samurott can pivot with Flip Turn and deal with the likes of Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, Iron Crown, and Galarian Slowking while also providing Spikes with Ceaseless Edge, which, alongside its own Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokémon, makes it extremely effective against bulkier cores like Alomomola + Galarian Slowking or Ting-Lu, Toxapex + Gliscor or Ting-Lu, and Dondozo + Gliscor or Blissey. Pelipper's Drizzle can give Raging Bolt the options to run Thunder and Weather Ball, letting it hit would-be checks in Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads with Water-type coverage. Barraskewda is a great partner on rain teams, as it's extremely hard to switch into and able to pivot with Flip Turn, and it loves Raging Bolt's ability to pressure Water-types like Alomomola, Dondozo and Primarina. Raging Bolt fits similarly on sun teams, synergizing with Torkoal and Ninetales' Drought, which activates Protosynthesis and allows it to hit the likes of Rillaboom and Iron Treads with sun-boosted Weather Ball, and with Walking Wake, which pressures Ground-types and shared checks like Galarian Slowking and Blissey. Raging Bolt also appreciates a defensive backbone to fall onto when its Volt Switch is blocked or after revenge killing a Pokemon. Flying-types like Corviknight and Gliscor check Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, with the former offering hazard removal in Defog and the latter offering hazard support. Clefable's physical bulk allows it to take on Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor while setting up Stealth Rock; it can also cripple walls like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and Blissey with Knock Off and switch into Knock Off well itself. Alomomola makes a good partner thanks to its great physical bulk and longevity with Wish and Regenerator, which it can use in conjunction with Flip Turn to keep Raging Bolt healthy, and it appreciates the help in beating Ogerpon-W. Steel-types like Assault Vest Iron Crown and Tinkaton can threaten Iron Valiant and Kyurem, while Galarian Slowking can check them as well as offering a slow pivot and a powerful Future Sight. Lastly, hazard removal options like Great Tusk, Cinderace, and Iron Treads can clear the field for Choice Specs Raging Bolt."

    "name": "Raichu-Alola",
    "text": "Alolan Raichu surfs on Electric Terrain, blitzing past even the fastest Choice Scarf users in Greninja and Meowscarada and Swift Swim and Sand Rush users in Mega Swampert and Excadrill, which threaten to overwhelm Electric teams. Nasty Plot provides Alolan Raichu with the much-needed boost to OHKO Gliscor, Sinistcha, and Iron Hands with Shattered Psyche. Psyshock is preferred when using Life Orb, as it dispatches special walls like Clodsire and Galarian Slowking after minimal chip damage. Life Orb also lets Alolan Raichu OHKO Alolan Muk and Rotom-W with Rising Voltage at +2. Grass Knot and Focus Blast heavily damage Pokemon that scoff at its Electric- and Psychic-type moves like Mega Swampert, Iron Treads, and Hydreigon. However, it is to be noted that Alolan Raichu requires a Life Orb to have a shot at OHKOing Hydreigon. Normaum Z with Hyper Beam may be considered, as it pummels through targets Grass Knot covers on top of heavily damaging Mega Latias, which typically overwhelms Electric teams. Tapu Koko is a mandatory teammate for Alolan Raichu, as it sets Electric Terrain, deals with Dragon-types like Mega Altaria and Roaring Moon, and pressures Flying and Water teams extremely well due to its wide coverage. Physical attackers like Zeraora and Iron Hands help against special walls like Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Hisuian Goodra that Alolan Raichu struggles against. Ground-immune teammates like Zapdos and Rotom-W are appreciated, as they not only switch in against speedy threats like Sand Rush Excadrill and Choice Scarf Iron Treads when Electric Terrain ends but also deal with Grass- and Ground-types like Celebi and Great Tusk."

    "name": "Rayquaza",
    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Rayquaza poses quite a threat to offense and defense teams alike in Ubers. With sky-high offenses, a strong and spammable STAB move in Dragon Ascent, and two great setup move choices in Dragon Dance and Swords Dance, Rayquaza excels at dismantling bulky teams. A decent defensive profile, including a resistance to Water-type moves that lets it pivot into Kyogre's STAB moves and grants it an immunity to Ground-type moves and Sticky Web, and access to a strong Extreme Speed give Rayquaza valuable utility against offensive teams. However, its below-average Speed and weaknesses to some of the most threatening Pokemon in the tier, like Koraidon, Miraidon, and Extreme Killer Arceus, hold it back against offensive teams, while physically defensive Arceus formes hold it back against defensive teams. Additionally, it is hurt by Ho-Oh's presence, as it is weak to the Rock-type moves many Pokemon run to hit Ho-Oh, like Arceus-Ground's Stone Edge or Power Gem. With Dragon Dance, Rayquaza can fix its Speed issue while boosting its already mighty Attack. In conjunction with Tera Flying, Dragon Ascent plows through sturdy physical walls like Ho-Oh, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Water with minor chip damage. Earthquake hits Miraidon, Zacian-C, and Necrozma-DM, the few Flying-resistant Pokemon in the tier. Extreme Speed is valuable for threatening non-Tera Ghost Koraidon after a Scale Shot and picking off weakened foes like Chien-Pao and Miraidon. Jolly is usually the preferred nature to outspeed Zacian-C after a Dragon Dance and Choice Scarf Koraidon after two, but on Sticky Web teams that mitigate its Speed issue, Adamant is better for the extra power. Adamant Rayquaza also has the benefit of OHKOing Miraidon and Zacian-C with unboosted Earthquake from full health with Life Orb. Life Orb strengthens Dragon Ascent while allowing Rayquaza to 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM with +1 Earthquake. Focus Sash allows Rayquaza to survive a hit from Pokemon that would normally destroy it like Miraidon and Calyrex-I, allowing Rayquaza to beat them one-on-one. Tera Flying strengthens Rayquaza's already spammable Dragon Ascent, allowing it to get KOs it normally wouldn't. Tera Normal powers up Rayquaza's Extreme Speed, making it a fearsome late-game cleaner. Tera Ground allows Earthquake to 2HKO Necrozma-DM and always OHKO Zacian-C and Miraidon at +1 without Life Orb. Tera Steel gives Rayquaza setup opportunities and avoids revenge killing attempts against Pokemon that would normally trouble it, like Zacian-C, Choice Scarf Koraidon, Extreme Killer Arceus, Arceus-Fairy, and Eternatus. Rayquaza fits on hyper offense teams that value its great initial power alongside strong priority. Ribombee's Sticky Web helps with Rayquaza's Speed issue, allowing it to run an Adamant nature. In return, Rayquaza's great power and immunity to Sticky Web allow it to threaten opposing Sticky Web teams. Glimmora can both set Spikes and deal with Stealth Rock with Mortal Spin, helping Rayquaza set up or get KOs without needing to Terastallize. Rayquaza shares many checks with Koraidon, making them natural partners that can wear down their checks for the other. Zacian-C can help Rayquaza against Koraidon and Miraidon, threatening to put Miraidon into range of Rayquaza's Extreme Speed and forcing Choice Scarf Koraidon to lock into Flare Blitz for Rayquaza to freely set up on. Swords Dance Rayquaza is a powerful offensive force that can function as both a wallbreaker and a potential late-game cleaner. Dragon Ascent is resisted by very few Pokemon in the tier, and with a Life Orb boost, it can 2HKO many common neutral targets such as Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, Eternatus, and most Arceus formes. Earthquake hits most Pokemon resistant to Flying for super effective damage, notably having a chance to OHKO Miraidon and Zacian-C and dealing significant damage to Necrozma-DM. Extreme Speed allows Rayquaza to pick off weakened foes and get the jump on anything faster than it. Tera Normal transforms Rayquaza into a potent win condition with Extreme Speed. After a Swords Dance, a Tera Normal-boosted Extreme Speed can crucially OHKO Koraidon and Miraidon. A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed most Arceus formes and -1 Speed Zacian-C, which Adamant Rayquaza fails to do. Life Orb is the best item for Rayquaza to deal as much damage as possible, as without it, the aforementioned 2HKOs and OHKOs become more difficult to achieve. Rayquaza shines on hyper offense teams that can capitalize on its great offensive profile. Sticky Web support helps mitigate Rayquaza's mediocre Speed, allowing it to outspeed Zacian-C, Miraidon, and Koraidon if the latter two Pokemon are not running Choice Scarf. Physical attackers like Zacian-C, Koraidon, and Arceus-Ground make great teammates, as together they can overwhelm their shared checks—such as Ho-Oh, Landorus-T, and defensive Arceus formes—and clear the way for each other to sweep. Zacian-C is an especially fantastic teammate, since it can handle any super effective attacks thrown at Rayquaza, as well as Extreme Speed from Arceus, and together they wear down Necrozma-DM, which resists their STAB moves. Miraidon appreciates Rayquaza's ability to punish the passive Ground-types that commonly switch into it, such as Ting-Lu. Rayquaza is forced to take Life Orb recoil damage and defense drops from Dragon Ascent, making it very susceptible to priority users like Extreme Speed Arceus and Kingambit; as such, a reliable answer like Zacian-C or a Tera Ghost user, such as Koraidon, Miraidon, or Arceus, is needed as a teammate. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to ignore Stealth Rock entirely. However, hyper offense teams, which Rayquaza finds itself on, can generally deal with Stealth Rock. Tera Fire can be used on the Dragon Dance set to gain an immunity to Will-O-Wisp. However, it is generally outclassed by Tera Steel. Faster Pokemon: Without a Dragon Dance, many Pokemon in Ubers outspeed Rayquaza and threaten it in return, including, but not limited to, Koraidon, Miraidon, Eternatus, and Chien-Pao. Choice Scarf Koraidon also outspeeds Rayquaza even after one Dragon Dance. Ice-types: Calyrex-I is more than bulky enough to survive boosted Dragon Ascents from Rayquaza and threaten it back. Chien-Pao and Kyurem-B also outspeed and threaten unboosted Rayquaza but must be wary of Extreme Speed. Priority: Rayquaza is quite susceptible to getting picked off by strong priority moves from the likes of Extreme Killer Arceus, Chien-Pao, and Kingambit. Ice-type Coverage: Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground can run Ice Beam to OHKO Rayquaza, making setting up against them unsafe. Rock-type Coverage: Calm Mind Arceus-Ground commonly runs Power Gem, while Necrozma-DM, Landorus-T, and Dragon Dance Arceus-Ground run Stone Edge, which can hinder Rayquaza's opportunities to set up. Bulky Arceus Formes: Bulky Arceus formes like Fairy, Ground, and Water can survive +1 Dragon Ascent from full health and threaten Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave, severely hurting Rayquaza's ability to sweep. Arceus-Fairy in particular can threaten an OHKO with Judgment. Corviknight: Although Corviknight is rare, it walls Rayquaza and can set up Iron Defense all over it."

  "Regigigas": {
    "name": "Regigigas",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Regigigas is a supremely bulky Pokemon with immense Attack, a fantastic movepool, and passable Speed, but it all falls apart because of its ability. For five turns, it is wholly outclassed by almost every other supporting Normal-type, and it is not strong enough during those turns to make up for it. If your opponent is kind enough to bring Neutralizing Gas and stay in for five turns, then maybe Regigigas is a solid pick, but otherwise it has to be ready to play around Fighting-type moves and phazing to unlock its very hidden potential. Utility Tank: Using moves such as Body Slam and Thunder Wave to delay its Slow Start turns, Regigigas's bulk is solid enough assuming foes do not take advantage of it to set up. Afterwards, it is naturally strong enough to keep foes from doing so. Primary STAB Moves: Body Slam, Facade, Double-Edge Utility Moves: Thunder Wave, Brick Break, Knock Off, Protect Coverage: Avalanche, Body Press, Drain Punch, Earthquake, Heat Crash, Heavy Slam, High Horsepower, Ice Punch, Iron Head, Rock Slide, Stone Edge, Thunder Punch, Zen Headbutt Confuse Ray: Although incredibly unreliable, Confuse Ray has the potential to extend Regigigas's time on the field for long enough to lose Slow Start. Substitute: If opponents decides their offensive checks are too valuable to risk getting paralyzed, Substitute can be useful in protecting Regigigas for extended turns. Rest / Sleep Talk: With Rest being Regigigas's only way of recovering lost HP, RestTalk is a viable strategy for it, but it becomes even more passive than it already is. Leftovers: Regigigas uses Protect in order to pass Slow Start turns, and combining this with the passive recovery Leftovers gives is useful. Heavy-Duty Boots: Although Regigigas usually only switches onto the field one time, being able to prevent entry hazard damage or Toxic Spikes poison may be more useful than recovery depending on the situation. Rocky Helmet: Taking advantage of Regigigas's bulk, Rocky Helmet is useful in providing some much-needed chip damage. Sitrus Berry: Passive recovery is typically more useful on Regigigas, but Sitrus Berry is still a good choice. Mental Herb: Due to Regigigas's proneness to Taunt and Encore, Mental Herb may be a necessity in making sure foes cannot take advantage of the passiveness it has until Slow Start wears off. Red Card: Since Regigigas can usually survive hits, Red Card can be held to shut down any setup sweepers that wants to use its passiveness against it. Eject Button: In a similar vein to Red Card, Eject Button almost always gets activated, meaning Regigigas can serve better as a blanket check to a wide variety of Pokemon without having to worry about Slow Start leaving it vulnerable. There is no conceivable situation in which Regigigas should be a Tera Captain. Its Normal typing is already a good neutral defensive typing, and it usually is not around long enough to take advantage of Terastallization defensively or offensively. However, if Regigigas ends up being your Tera Captain, Tera Fairy and Water would be good choices, as they are generally good defensive types, with the former getting a free turn of passing Slow Start against Fighting-type moves. Regigigas struggles to find itself on a team, but it works best on drafts that need a cheap option for a tank. Unfortunately for it, however, it slows the tempo down too much to fit on offense teams and does not provide any resistances for defensive teams to take advantage of. Due to Regigigas's fringe usefulness, a team should not be built around it. A Team Unreliant on Regigigas: Regigigas should not be the only bulky Pokemon on a team, so as long as your draft is not especially weak to Ghost, it should not be structured with the intent of bringing it to most games. Fighting-type Pokemon: Although Pokemon like Great Tusk, Urshifu-S, and Iron Valiant do not want to get paralyzed, they still force Regigigas out, forcing it to lose any progress made on losing its Slow Start debuffs. Disruption: Moves such as Roar, Whirlwind, Encore, and Taunt, all severely impede Regigigas's effectiveness, with the first two acting as a hard reset for whatever it wants to do. Tera Electric Setup Sweepers: Although most setup sweepers can easily set up on the passive Regigigas, Pokemon that already value Tera Electric such as Tornadus-T, Annihilape, and Zarude can freely set up on it without having to worry about getting paralyzed while Slow Start is still active. Residual Damage: Despite being best when it gets to stay on the field for a longer time, Regigigas is usually forced out, and chip damage from entry hazards on sets without Heavy-Duty Boots adds up fast. Physical Walls: Although Regigigas has access to special coverage options, physical walls like Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Metagross can all shrug off its attacks and hit back with Body Press."

  "Regirock": {
    "name": "Regirock",
    "text": "Thanks to its titanic Defense, Regirock can stonewall popular physical attackers like Snorlax and Dudunsparce and use them as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock. Rock Blast deals reliable damage to Typhlosion, Oricorio-G, and Charizard and breaks Substitute on users like Frosmoth and Rotom. Body Press crushes Normal-types like Snorlax and Dudunsparce, Ice-types like Glastrier and Sneasel, and Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton. Iron Defense boosts Regirock's physical bulk and powers up Body Press, turning Regirock into a bulky setup sweeper capable of suffocating physical attackers like Snorlax and overwhelming walls like Sandaconda. Thunder Wave slows down setup sweepers like Hitmonlee and fast Pokemon like Whimsicott but makes Regirock more passive. Clear Body helpfully denies stat debuffs from Intimidate, Shadow Ball, and Triple Arrows. 16 Defense EVs and an Impish nature is a useful jump point to balance Regirock's bulk. Tera Poison helps with Regirock's Grass and Fighting weaknesses and gives it an immunity to poison. Regirock fits best on teams looking for a physically defensive backbone that can set up Stealth Rock. While Regirock has great physical bulk, its typing and comparatively lesser special bulk leave it more prone to strong special attacks. Specially defensive partners like Snorlax, Articuno, and Hisuian Qwilfish complement Regirock's physical bulk and can intercept special attackers like Hisuian Electrode, Whimsicott, and Mesprit. Hisuian Decidueye and Toedscruel can form entry hazard cores with Regirock and help keep it from taking entry hazard chip damage. Other Grass-type partners like Alolan Exeggutor, Dipplin, and Virizion are also appreciated by Regirock, as they can cover its Ground, Grass, and Water weaknesses by taking on Sandslash, opposing Dipplin, and Clawitzer, while Regirock can take on threatening Flying-types like Oricorio-G and Articuno. On paper, Sturdy gives a healthy Regirock a guaranteed turn to set up Stealth Rock, but between Regirock being so bulky and entry hazards being ubiquitous, it's unlikely that Regirock would be at risk of being OHKOed from full HP outside of uncommonly strong hits like Clawitzer's Water Pulse or Alolan Exeggutor's Leaf Storm. Regirock is totally dependent on the passive recovery from Leftovers to be a reliable wall, so even items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Rocky Helmet are suboptimal. Stone Edge is generally stronger than Rock Blast but has unreliable accuracy and poor PP, and it and Rock Slide cannot break past Substitute Pokemon. Curse can be used as a setup move over Iron Defense to power up Regirock's Rock Blast, but the extra Defense from Iron Defense is more useful to stonewall physical attackers, and Regirock's Body Press is more powerful and reliable than its STAB move anyway. Protect can enhance Regirock's recovery from Leftovers and allow Regirock to scout common Choice item attackers like Jolteon, Whimsicott, and Floatzel but it makes Regirock much more passive. Tera Ghost lets Regirock become immune to Fighting-type moves from major offensive threats like Hitmonlee, Toxicroak, and Passimian while preserving Regirock's ability to check Snorlax and enabling it to block Rapid Spin from Sandslash and Toedscruel. Tera Grass helps Regirock manage its common Grass, Water, and Ground weaknesses, whereas Tera Water lets Regirock better handle Glastrier, and Tera Steel shares Tera Poison's poison immunity and Grass resistance while giving Regirock an easier time against Mesprit and Farigiraf. Regirock can run a Careful nature to patch up its relatively lower special bulk, but Regirock is often tasked with taking on physical attackers, and more Defense investment benefits its IronPress combination. Ground-types: Palossand counters Regirock and uses it as an opportunity to set up Stealth Rock, recover with Shore Up, or threaten Regirock and its teammates with burns from Scorching Sands. Sandaconda has great longevity, while Sandslash and Toedscruel can remove Regirock's entry hazards with Rapid Spin, but all three must be wary of Regirock boosting too much with Iron Defense. Special Attackers: Regirock's lower special bulk leaves it prone to being overwhelmed by special attackers like Mesprit, Jolteon, and Rotom. Magneton can hit Regirock super effectively with its STAB Flash Cannon. However, most special attackers are physically frail, and Magneton takes a lot of damage from Regirock's Body Press. Many special attackers also cannot KO Regirock without significant chip or several boosts. Fighting-types: Regirock's Fighting weakness can lead it to fall victim to Fighting-types like Hitmonlee, Passimian, and Hisuian Decidueye, the last of which can remove Regirock's Stealth Rock. However, Regirock can turn the tables on physically offensive Fighting-types with its IronPress combination and Terastallization. Specially offensive variants of Toxicroak and Virizion further exploit Regirock's lower Special Defense and circumvent Iron Defense boosts. Grass-types: Whimsicott, Hisuian Electrode, and Sceptile can blow through Regirock with their strong super effective STAB moves, and Whimsicott is distinguished for avoiding a 2HKO from Regirock's Body Press after Stealth Rock. Alolan Exeggutor annihilates Regirock, while Dipplin can phaze Regirock with Dragon Tail and use Recover to wall it back. Water-types: Swords Dance Qwilfish and Veluza both Body Press and can rely on their Water-type STAB moves to break through Regirock. Clawitzer can OHKO Regirock with Water Pulse but cannot switch into Regirock's Body Press more than once with Stealth Rock up. Knock Off, Trick, and Switcheroo: Regirock relies on its Leftovers for recovery, so Knock Off users like Sneasel, Mesprit, and Grafaiai are disruptive to Regirock. Mespirit and Hisuian Sneasel can use Trick and Switcheroo to disrupt Regirock by giving it their Choice items. Residual damage: Burns and poison neutralize Regirock's already limited passive recovery. Burns from Will-O-Wisp users like Weezing and Rotom halve Regirock's damage output, while Toxic from Hisuian Qwilfish, Dudunsparce, and Toedscruel puts Regirock on a timer. Entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes cause Regirock to struggle to stay healthy. Taunt and Encore: Encore users like Whimsicott and Grafaiai can lock Regirock into a move to exploit it though neither enjoy taking Body Press. Qwilfish and Primeape can use Taunt to stop Regirock from setting up Stealth Rock or Iron Defense. Sableye can run Taunt or Encore and does not fear Regirock's Body Press."

  "Registeel": {
    "name": "Registeel",
    "text": "Thanks to its impressive mixed bulk and utility movepool, Registeel finds a home in the tier as one of the premier walls. Its typing has key resistances to Dragon, Fairy, and Rock, letting it stand in the way of threats like Dragalge, Sylveon, and Diancie. It also isn't completely passive; it can threaten common Fairy-types with its powerful Heavy Slam or even set up on and take out the defensive Pokemon that it walls, like Umbreon, with the devilish IronPress combination. Additionally, Registeel is a great entry hazard setter that has no issue finding opportunities to set Stealth Rock during a game. However, Registeel's typing can often be a burden, as its weaknesses are taken advantage of by common wallbreakers like Chandelure, Breloom, and Flygon. Additionally, Registeel is vulnerable to getting weakened over the course of a battle, as it relies on Leftovers as its only method of recovery. Lastly, Registeel's easy to exploit with slow and paralysis-immune Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Swampert that don't mind Thunder Wave, as well as Ghost-types like Hisuian Typhlosion and Chandelure. Earthquake prevents Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion from walling Registeel, and it also chunks Poison-types like Alolan Muk and Dragalge. Thunder Wave is an immediate punishment to fast attackers like Infernape and Mienshao attempting to switch in on non-attacking moves. Alternatively, the IronPress combination can be used to take advantage of defensive Pokemon like Copperajah, Sylveon, and Umbreon. Tera Dragon gives Registeel useful resistances to many special attackers' strongest attacks, letting it sponge hits like Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump from Inteleon and Fire Blast from Chandelure in a pinch. Tera Ghost can be used to blank Fighting-type attacks from the likes of Mienshao and Toxicroak while notably blocking Rapid Spin. Tera Fairy can also be used to help against Fighting-types, additionally helping IronPress variants to check Dark-types like Brute Bonnet and Incineroar, but it's less effective against Toxicroak. Tera Water can be used to give Registeel a resistance to Water and Fire, which is useful against the likes of Basculegion, Inteleon, and Chandelure, while maintaining its resistance to Ice. Registeel fits best on balance teams alongside other defensive Pokemon as part of a core. Vaporeon and Florges are good examples, being able to pass Wish to Registeel to keep it healthy while also having useful resistances to Fire and Fighting, respectively. Spikes setters like Quagsire and Diancie complement Registeel's Stealth Rock, wearing down opposing Pokemon more consistently. Wallbreaking beneficiaries of hazard-stacking cores that Registeel is a part of include Sylveon, which can check Fighting-types and invite in and chip down Fire-types, and Inteleon, a wallbreaker that is incredibly threatening to Ground-types and can chunk defensive Water-types. Fighting- and Fire-type checks like Talonflame, Vileplume, Vaporeon, and Diancie make for good partners, being able to handle the likes of Mienshao and Chandelure. Additionally, Tsareena and Talonflame can tank Ground-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks and remove entry hazards for Registeel. Fighting-types like Mienshao and Breloom appreciate the entry hazards that Registeel sets and also benefit from its ability to check common answers to them like Munkidori and Sylveon. Vileplume partners with Registeel to create a solid defensive partnership, being able to spread paralysis alongside Registeel to help out partners like Chandelure and Paldean Tauros-F. Registeel can run a set of Iron Defense / Amnesia / Body Press / Rest with a Chesto Berry to become a dangerous sweeper that's difficult to break through, but it is quite passive while boosting, is walled by Ghost-types, and can be crippled by Trick, Encore, and Taunt. Fire-types: Fire-types like Infernape, Chandelure, and Incineroar can easily threaten out Registeel with their super effective STAB moves; however, they don't love switching into Earthquake or Thunder Wave. Talonflame's annoying because it easily removes Registeel's Stealth Rock with Defog and can inhibit any IronPress sweeping attempts with Will-O-Wisp. Ground-types: Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon can shrug off Registeel's attacks and threaten it out with Earthquake, additionally being immune to Thunder Wave. Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage: The likes of Mienshao and Paldean Tauros-W terrify Registeel with their strong Close Combat, and other attackers like Munkidori can use Focus Blast to handle Registeel. However, none of these Pokemon want to switch into Thunder Wave. Passive Damage: Registeel is vulnerable to being chipped down by entry hazards, and this is particularly noticeable when its Leftovers has been removed by Knock Off or cancelled out by burn."

  "Reuniclus": {
    "name": "Reuniclus",
    "text": "Calm Mind Reuniclus is a potent late-game cleaner that is difficult to break past for weakened teams. Reuniclus is unable to be dealt with through forms of passive damage such as Spikes, Toxic, and Leech Seed, which many defensive teams rely on to wear down opposing threats. While slow, Reuniclus sports good bulk when invested, allowing it to set up Calm Mind on Pokemon like Chesnaught, Cyclizar, and Slowbro that can't damage it for more than around half of its HP, as it will simply recover off the damage over time and KO them with a boosted STAB move or coverage. Tera complicates this further, as Reuniclus can flip its bad type matchups and set up on Pokemon like Krookodile and Barraskewda that are typically able to threaten it with significant damage. Powerful Pokemon holding boosting items such as Life Orb Mimikyu and Choice Specs Basculegion-F can threaten Reuniclus with strong super effective STAB moves while not being immediately KOed by Reuniclus's own relatively weak attacks before boosting. Reuniclus must also be wary of Encore and Roar from Pokemon such as Jirachi and Empoleon that can switch in and disrupt its boosting before it's strong enough to break the opposing team. Jirachi in particular can flinch Reuniclus down with Iron Head before it has a chance to use Recover. Psychic Noise is chosen as the primary STAB move to thwart both Slowbro and opposing Reuniclus's attempts to heal. It also stops faster defensive walls like Gastrodon and Empoleon from healing for a turn, either letting Reuniclus finish them off or switching to a teammate that forces them out. This keeps special walls from recovering back to full HP, letting Reuniclus outlast them and sweep. Focus Blast hits Dark-types immune to Psychic Noise like Krookodile and Bisharp while slamming Steel-types like Magnezone and Hisuian Goodra. Shadow Ball helps Reuniclus beat variations of Calm Mind Slowbro with Covert Cloak that block Psychic Noise and hits other Psychic-types like Jirachi and opposing Reuniclus. Leftovers helps reduce Reuniclus's reliance on Recover, allowing it to boost more often with Calm Mind or attack once already boosted. Rocky Helmet punishes Jirachi trying to flinch Reuniclus with Iron Head or paralyze it with Body Slam while also wearing down Pokemon with U-turn and Knock Off like Galarian Zapdos and Cyclizar that want to pivot to another teammate or remove Reuniclus's item. Due to Reuniclus having an effective immunity to status like poison, it does not need to use Tera Poison to beat Fezandipiti and Bellibolt and instead can opt for Tera Water or Fairy for their defensive value. Tera Water allows Reuniclus to resist Iron Head from Steel-type checks like Jirachi and Bisharp and rain-boosted Water-type attacks from Barraskewda and Kingdra. Tera Fairy flips Reuniclus's Dark weakness into a resistance, which is helpful for resisting strong Dark-type attacks from Pokemon like Bisharp and Krookodile. Bug-types like Yanmega and Slither Wing can be set up on once Reuniclus resists their most powerful STAB moves as well. Tera Fairy also has the additional benefit of an immunity to Dragon Tail users such as Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra looking to phaze it out. Calm Mind Reuniclus offers bulky offense and balanced teams good counterplay to the residual damage of entry hazards as well as an absorber of burn and Toxic poison. For example, Reuniclus can help relieve pressure on Cyclizar to spin away entry hazards because Reuniclus itself does not care about their residual damage. This allows Cyclizar to more freely use Knock Off to remove opposing items and use U-turn to pivot out of switch-ins like Hisuian Goodra looking to take advantage of Rapid Spin. Reuniclus is a great switch-in to status spreaders like Slowbro and Galarian Weezing, and as such partners that bait in these Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Barraskewda that can use pivoting moves make good partners, allowing Reuniclus to enter the field and set up. Switching in on status moves like Scald is often advantageous for Reuniclus, as burn or Toxic poison prevents Reuniclus from being paralyzed by its most common check, Jirachi. Reuniclus does not appreciate losing its Leftovers to Cyclizar's Knock Off, so teammates like Slither Wing and Terrakion that can switch in on Knock Off and threaten damage on the opponent are good options. Rocky Helmet Chesnaught is another way to punish Knock Off that can set Spikes to chip down Reuniclus's checks while acting as a good check to strong physical attacking Dark-types like Crawdaunt and Bisharp that threaten Reuniclus. Specially defensive Jirachi is a thorn in Reuniclus's side regardless of its coverage option, as it can be flinched down with Iron Head and paralyzed. Basculegion-F, Thundurus, and Magnezone are strong special breakers that don't fear Body Slam paralysis or Iron Head from defensive Jirachi and thus force out the opponent's Jirachi into a teammate that must now absorb a hit from some of the most threatening special attackers in the tier. These three teammates also have pivoting moves in Flip Turn and Volt Switch, letting them choose a teammate to bring in on a predicted Jirachi switch while chipping down the opponent's switch-in in the process. Defensive Reuniclus finds a place in a metagame lacking phenomenal Dark-types outside of Krookodile and Bisharp and with a myriad of Fighting- and Psychic- types such as Terrakion, Mienshao, Slowbro and Jirachi. Its bulk and typing allow it to continuously switch into the aforementioned Fighting- and Psychic-types' moves and weaken the opposition while staying healthy with a combination of Recover and Regenerator. It can also act as a crucial member of teams relying on paralysis that enjoy its resistance to Fighting as well as its ability to invite in the likes of Bisharp and Jirachi and cripple them with Thunder Wave. Despite being in competition with Slowbro, Reuniclus's Electric neutrality as well as higher special bulk make it sometimes worth using over Slowbro. Thunder Wave makes it easier for wallbreakers like Volcanion, Conkeldurr, and Crawdaunt to shine. Psychic Noise is used over the stronger Psychic and Psyshock due to the recovery blocking effect. Knock Off is another excellent support move that forces progress by removing the bevy of Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Focus Blast can be used over Knock Off to deal with Krookodile and Bisharp as well as smacking Empoleon. Tera Water gives Reuniclus an excellent defensive matchup against rain teams and strong Water-type attacks from offensive threats such as Barraskewda, Suicune, and Volcanion while also removing the weakness to Bug- and Dark-type attacks like U-turn and Knock Off. Tera Fairy turns the aforementioned weaknesses into resistances, gives a Dragon-type immunity against strong threats like Salamence and Noivern, and is generally a good defensive Tera type for a bulkier Pokemon like Reuniclus. Reuniclus fits best on balance and bulky offense teams that enjoy its ability to switch into the myriad of Fighting-type moves in the tier and slow down and soften the opposition with Thunder Wave and Knock Off, respectively. Volcanion and Crawdaunt are great offensive partners for Reuniclus, as they enjoy Reuniclus's ability to slow down the opposition. Fighting-types such as Slither Wing and Galarian Zapdos make great offensive and defensive partners for Reuniclus. On the offensive side, they enjoy Reuniclus's Thunder Wave support and its Psychic resistance, while on the defensive side they resist the omnipresent Knock Off and U-turn. Reuniclus also enjoy Palossand, Fezandipiti, Chesnaught and other Fighting-type checks due to its crippling weakness to Knock Off and U-turn. Palossand and Chesnaught are also excellent entry hazard setters and enjoy Reuniclus's Knock Off support. However, since this Reuniclus set doesn't use Magic Guard, it enjoys hazard-removing partners like Cyclizar."

  "Revavroom": {
    "name": "Revavroom",
    "text": "Shift Gear Revavroom is one of the most threatening late-game sweepers in the tier, as with its access to Shift Gear and great defensive typing, all it needs is one boost to offensively overwhelm most of the tier. Setting up is made easier with its ability, Filter, which allows it to take a Flamethrower from Pokemon like Galarian Weezing and Noivern. Revavroom also has access to useful coverage moves that allow it to threaten Steel-, Poison-, and Fire-types. Nevertheless, Revavroom is quite frail, as its poor Special Defense and reliance on Air Balloon to set up can be exploited by Ground-types, especially Hippowdon, Krookodile, Quagsire, and Palossand, as they can take a +1 hit from full HP and OHKO it back. Revavroom is a one-dimensional Pokemon that focuses solely on setting up with Shift Gear and sweeping the opposing team. With an Adamant nature, a single Shift Gear lets Revavroom outspeed all relevant Choice Scarf users. Revavroom has access to Gunk Shot and High Horsepower, which give it excellent coverage; Gunk Shot nearly or straight-out KOes defensive staples like Fezandipiti and Chesnaught after one Shift Gear, while High Horsepower hits Steel- and Poison-types, which resist or are immune to Gunk Shot. Iron Head gives it a reliable STAB move that also hits Ground-types. Tera Ground gives Revavroom an additional STAB move in High Horsepower, which allows it to grab crucial OHKOs such as Bisharp, Volcanion, and Fezandipiti after one Shift Gear boost. Revavroom is a staple on hyper offense teams, and its role is usually to clean late-game. Therefore, it prefers wallbreakers and other setup sweepers such as Terrakion, Basculegion-F, Maushold, and Yanmega as partners. The usual gameplan with Revavroom is wearing down Steel- and Fire-types with it, allowing another sweeper such as Mimikyu or Necrozma to clean. The opposite is also true, as Bisharp and Yanmega can weaken bulky Ground- and Water-types for Revavroom to sweep late-game. Revavroom should usually be brought in after a teammate has been KOed to ensure that Air Balloon remains intact and it is at near full health, as it is frail defensively. Revavroom can opt to run Tera Blast Grass, which threatens Water- and Ground-types such as Slowbro, Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Krookodile. Temper Flare is also an option to take down Steel-types with a Ground immunity such as Bronzong and Tera Steel Rotom-H, as well as helping against opposing Revavroom. Temper Flare can also be boosted with Tera Fire, making Revavroom immune to burn. Finally, Taunt is a solid option to completely wall and set up on Quagsire and Whirlwind Hippowdon with Air Balloon as well as to block Will-O-Wisp from Galarian Weezing. Tera Flying + Taunt is a good combination to completely shut down Whirlwind Hippowdon and Quagsire even after Air Balloon breaks. Revavroom can also opt to run Leftovers + Magnet Rise to get rid of its Ground weakness and set up on Ground-types more easily. Clear Amulet can also be used to block Intimidate from Krookodile and Salamence. Toxic is an option to put bulky Fire- and Water-type switch-ins on a timer. Toxic Spikes allows Revavroom to take advantage of the free turns it generates. Toxic and Toxic Spikes could be used on a Choice Scarf Revavroom set, which could be a decent source of role compression also capable of pivoting using Parting Shot. Levitate Steel-types: Steel-types with Levitate are immune to Gunk Shot and High Horsepower and resist Iron Head. As such, Pokemon such as Bronzong and Tera Steel Rotom-H are the sturdiest answers to Revavroom. Bulky Ground-types: Revavroom fails to KO bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Quagsire, and Palossand even after a Shift Gear boost, and they threaten to KO it. Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Quagsire, and Gastrodon deal with Revavroom quite well, potentially burning it with Scald in Slowbro's case or outright KOing it with Ground-type STAB moves in Quagsire and Gastrodon's cases. They do lose to Tera Grass variants, however."

    "text": "These are sample sets while we work on the full analyses. Stay tuned for updates as the metagame develops. This analysis was uploaded prior to The Indigo Disk release and may contain outdated information. Ribombee is a metagame-defining Sticky Web lead found in hyper offense teams due to its impressive Speed tier, notably outpacing maximum Speed invested Arceus formes, avoiding Taunt from them. Moonblast allows Ribombee to discourage Ting-Lu from laying entry hazards, Koraidon and Miraidon from setting up, and Giratina-O from using Defog. Stun Spore is used to cripple Pokemon that can otherwise use Ribombee as setup fodder such as Arceus formes and Zacian-C. Psychic is an option to hit Glimmora for super effective damage, deterring it from using Mortal Spin. Charm is also an alternative move that is used to annoy physical attackers, hindering them from setting up. Tera Ghost allows Ribombee to block Rapid Spin from leads like Great Tusk while also providing it with an immunity to Extreme Speed from Arceus. Tera Steel is an alternative option to block Mortal Spin from Glimmora. Teammates such as Koraidon, Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, Miraidon, and Eternatus benefit heavily from Sticky Web being up, as it makes them much more difficult to revenge kill, with some such as Zacian-C and Eternatus also providing utility by blocking Mortal Spin from Glimmora and setting up Toxic Spikes, respectively. As Ribombee gets shut down by Taunt from Calyrex-S and Miraidon, offensive checks to them such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Arceus-Ground are preferred as teammates. As Ribombee lacks Taunt, another lead such as Arceus-Ground or Glimmora can be used to prevent entry hazards from opposing leads."

  "Rillaboom": {
    "name": "Rillaboom",
    "text": "With its combination of power, strong priority, solid bulk, and excellent support through Grassy Terrain, Rillaboom is a premier wallbreaker and revenge killer in OU. Grassy Glide allows Rillaboom to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Iron Boulder, Great Tusk, and Barraskewda while also denying lead Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott from getting two turns to set entry hazards. Wood Hammer is an excellent tool for breaking through even resistant Pokemon, being able to 2HKO Raging Bolt and Kingambit after Stealth Rock while OHKOing Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Hatterene. U-turn makes Rillaboom a pivot while also being the strongest option against other Rillaboom, Roaring Moon if lacking Drain Punch, and Hydrapple. Knock Off removes items from Rillaboom's checks, including Dragonite, Skarmory, and Moltres, while also being the best option to hit Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking. Drain Punch is an alternative that OHKOes Kingambit and hits Heatran switching in while increasing Rillaboom's longevity. An Adamant nature is preferred for its power boost; however, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed opposing Adamant Rillaboom and Gholdengo without Choice Scarf at the cost of being unable to always OHKO Pokemon like Dondozo and Galarian Slowking with Wood Hammer and Knock Off. An alternative EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be used alongside an Adamant nature to outspeed Gliscor while allowing Rillaboom to survive hits such as Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost, Ogerpon-W's +2 Power Whip, and Tornadus-T's Bleakwind Storm; however, it notably worsens Rillaboom's matchup against opposing Rillaboom and Raging Bolt due to being outsped. Tera Grass powers up Rillaboom's Grass-type moves, allowing Grassy Glide to OHKO Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock and Wood Hammer to OHKO Clefable, Toxapex, and Gliscor after Stealth Rock. Bulk Up Great Tusk can take advantage of Grassy Terrain's recovery while removing entry hazards for Rillaboom with Rapid Spin, as Rillaboom is prone to hazard damage. Hawlucha is another one of Rillaboom's biggest beneficiaries, using Grassy Seed and Unburden to become an excellent sweeper with nearly unmatched Speed. In return, Rillaboom breaks open bulky teams for Hawlucha and Great Tusk and removes Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Terastallized Dondozo. Bulky Ground-weak Pokemon, including Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Heatran, appreciate Grassy Terrain nullifying their weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Gliscor and Ting-Lu while providing extra passive recovery. Kingambit can form a dual priority core with Rillaboom, notably revenge killing Grass-resistant Pokemon like Dragapult and Gholdengo while any attempts to stall out its Sucker Punch give an extra turn of recovery from Grassy Terrain. Raging Bolt is another excellent priority user and wallbreaker that additionally enjoys Rillaboom's U-turn bringing it on checks like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Moltres. Iron Moth and Heatran can also come in on Rillaboom's checks like Cinderace, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Iron Defense Zamazenta is an excellent teammate, as Rillaboom breaks and overwhelms walls like Dondozo and Skarmory that would get in the way of its sweep, and the extra longevity from Grassy Terrain is amazing to keep Zamazenta healthy, as it lacks any reliable ways to heal outside of Leftovers. Hatterene and Comfey can become potent sweepers when used with Rillaboom, both being able to run Grassy Seed while the extra longevity allows Hatterene to keep hazards off more consistenly with Magic Bounce. Grassy Seed allows Hatterene and Comfey to set up on physical attackers that can no longer 2HKO them like Heavy Slam Zamazenta, Ogerpon-W, and Great Tusk while giving an appreciated boost to their Stored Power. Ursaluna and Rillaboom form a terrifying offensive core, with Rillaboom supporting Ursaluna with Knock Off and Grassy Terrain to nullify Flame Orb's chip damage. Both Tail Glow and Take Heart Manaphy can be used alongside Rillaboom, as the Terrain powers up its Energy Ball and gives extra longevity to set up, become unbreakable, and fire off devastating Stored Powers, respectively. Rillaboom can bypass checks like Dragonite, Zapdos, and Moltres with support from Stealth Rock setters like Heatran, Great Tusk, and Glimmora in addition to its Knock Off to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots. Rillaboom is an excellent Terrain setter, revenge killer, wallbreaker, and offensive pivot all at once thanks to its good Attack stat, Grassy Surge, and access to a phenomenal movepool. Knock Off hits Grass-resistant foes such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking super effectively while also removing items from common switch-ins such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Moltres, Rocky Helmet from Skarmory, and Leftovers from Zamazenta, reducing their effectiveness. U-turn allows Rillaboom to pivot out of bad matchups such as against Dragon-types like Dragonite and Raging Bolt and generate momentum for its team; it also enables Rillaboom to bring its setup sweeper teammates like Hawlucha and Hatterene in. Low Kick hits foes like Kingambit and Heatran for super effective damage. Alternatively, Wood Hammer can be used as a stronger STAB move, OHKOing offensive Great Tusk and 2HKOing defensive variants, 2HKOing Hatterene, and having a roll to OHKO Ting-Lu. 52 Speed EVs allow Rillaboom to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Alternatively, a spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be run for Rillaboom to outspeed Gliscor. With Tera Grass, Rillaboom 2HKOes Iron Valiant with Grassy Glide and Gliscor with Wood Hammer after Poison Heal. Otherwise, Tera Fighting can be used to make Rillaboom resistant to Dark-type moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Terrain Extender helps teammates like Hawlucha to find more opportunities to come in; however, Assault Vest can be used instead to allow Rillaboom to better check special attackers such as Primarina and Gholdengo. Rillaboom shines on offense teams and is a staple on Grassy Terrain-based teams. Terrain Extender should usually be used on hyper offense teams and provides wonderful support to its setup sweeper partners. Assault Vest has overall better defensive utility and thus should generally be used on bulky offense teams; it is exceptional at supporting bulkier threats such as Zamazenta, helping them deal with foes like Primarina and Gholdengo. Although generally the best fits, these recommendations are not set in stone, and either item can be used on either archetype, with Assault Vest potentially providing hyper offense with a one-time check to a special threat and Terrain Extender supporting bulky offense. Hawlucha proves itself to be an exceptional partner for Rillaboom; In Grassy Terrain, it can utilize Grassy Seed to transform into a terrifying cleaner with Swords Dance and Unburden. Hatterene also functions as a remarkable Calm Mind cleaner with Grassy Seed and longevity from Grassy Terrain. Similarly, Primarina appreciates the longevity Grassy Terrain provides to turn itself into a dangerous threat with Calm Mind; moreover, it synergizes well with Rillaboom by helping it against Fire-types such as Moltres. Setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon and Raging Bolt also appreciate Grassy Terrain's passive recovery and pivoting from Rillaboom. Other teammates that benefit from the same include Pokemon weak to Earthquake from foes like Ting-Lu and Gliscor, such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and the aforementioned Raging Bolt. Rillaboom is vulnerable to Fire-types like Moltres, Cinderace, and Iron Moth so teammates such as Heatran, Roaring Moon, and Great Tusk are appreciated. Rillaboom also likes entry hazards to chip its foes; thus, the aforementioned Heatran and Glimmora make perfect partners. Rillaboom is forced out by threats like Dragonite, Skarmory, Corviknight, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon because it's unable to significantly damage them, so partners such as Dragapult and the previously mentioned Raging Bolt should be acknowledged. Dragon-types like Dragapult and Raging Bolt can also give Rillaboom a hard time due to them being resistant to its Grassy Glide, so Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Kingambit make great partners. As a Terrain setter, Rillaboom and its teammates can face difficulty in facing Ice Spinner users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads; as such, it is important to position setup sweepers as soon as possible while also packing checks such as the aforementioned Hatterene for Great Tusk and Zamazenta for Iron Treads. Hatterene is also very useful at keeping entry hazards off the field, which is appreciated by Rillaboom and its teammates. Additional hazard removers such as the previously mentioned Great Tusk also make great partners. Zamazenta is also a wonderful partner that proves itself to be a threatening IronPress user with Grassy Terrain solving its problem with longevity. Comfey can also take advantage of Grassy Seed's Defense boost and Grassy Terrain's passive recovery to set up with Calm Mind and dismantle unprepared teams. Serperior is also an excellent teammate and greatly benefits from Grassy Terrain boosting its Leaf Storm, notably allowing it to KO offensive Gholdengo over two turns."

  "Roaring Moon": {
    "name": "Roaring Moon",
    "text": "Dragon Dance Roaring Moon is one of the tier's most dangerous sweepers due to its fantastic Attack and Speed complemented further by its decent bulk, a great typing both offensively and defensively, and diverse coverage options that dramatically limit its defensive counterplay. Acrobatics, thanks to its perfect synergy with Booster Energy, boasts excellent coverage alongside Knock Off by giving Roaring Moon an incredibly powerful option to super effectively hit threats like Great Tusk as well as Ogerpon-W, Serperior, and Rillaboom without the need to Dragon Dance; between it and Knock Off, Roaring Moon hits much of the tier for at least neutral damage, which is often enough for it to clean up late-game. Earthquake OHKOes threats that can survive a boosted Knock Off or Acrobatics, such as offensive Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Iron Treads. Taunt drastically improves Roaring Moon's matchup against defensive teams by preventing threats like Dondozo, Ting-Lu, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Skarmory from disrupting its sweep with their recovery, status, or setup moves; Taunt is still useful against more offensive teams by virtue of preventing Serperior from stopping Roaring Moon's sweep with Glare, denying Glimmora multiple layers of entry hazards, or preventing defensive Pokemon like Gliscor and Terastallized Garganacl from wearing it down. Similar to Taunt, Substitute is an option to prevent Roaring Moon from being crippled by Clefable's Thunder Wave and Gliscor's Toxic, but additionally blocks Almomomola's Scald and Gargnacl's Salt Cure as well as preventing it from being revenge killed easily if it manages to keep it up. Subsitute also gives Roaring Moon protection against revenge killing attempts, especially Kingambit's Sucker Punch post-Terastallization. Brick Break is an interesting alternative; it outright OHKOes Weavile and defensive Kingambit, hits Darkrai and opposing Roaring Moon super effectively, and greatly improves Roaring Moon's matchup against opposing dual screens or Aurora Veil teams. Tera Flying grants Roaring Moon some noteworthy defensive benefits, including turning its Fighting weakness into a resistance and granting it a Ground immunity, but its greatest benefit is giving Roaring Moon access to the absurd power of STAB Acrobatics; with the boost from Tera Flying, Roaring Moon can OHKO max HP Great Tusk without even needing a boost from Dragon Dance while having a chance to OHKO Zamazenta after a Dragon Dance. Tera Ground can be used to boost Earthquake, letting it overwhelm Pokemon like Sticky Barb Clefable, bulky Kingambit, and Tera Steel Great Tusk more easily. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Booster Energy Iron Valiant after a Dragon Dance, but the power increase from an Adamant nature is enough to OHKO bulky Kingambit with Earthquake without any chip damage while securing more reliable KOs against Zamazenta and bulkier Great Tusk variants. An alternative spread of 32 HP / 220 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature is a niche option that allows Roaring Moon to obtain a Speed boost from Protosynthesis; though this comes at a considerable loss of power, it allows Roaring Moon to immediately outspeed threats like Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which Roaring Moon can struggle to set up against, while giving it the ability to revenge kill weakened Speed-boosting Protosynthesis users like Great Tusk and Walking Wake without needing to set up a Dragon Dance. Roaring Moon is a staple on fast-paced hyper offense teams that can help facilitate its sweep, though on these teams it can also serve as a wallbreaker to help facilitate other setup sweepers as needed. Hisuian Samurott and Glimmora can reliably set up entry hazards to help Roaring Moon reliably OHKO bulky Kingambit without needing to commit to an Adamant nature, while dual screens setters like Deoxys-S, Alolan Ninetales, and Grimmsnarl can allow Roaring Moon to set up more safely, grant it a safety net against strong priority from the likes of Weavile and Tera Normal Dragonite, or even allow Roaring Moon to set up multiple Dragon Dances and devastate opposing offensive teams. Deoxys-S is a particularly excellent teammate for Roaring Moon; it can act as a fast dual screens setter, an entry hazard setter that can deny opposing hazards while bypassing Hatterene's Magic Bounce with Skill Swap, or a standalone offensive threat that can help overwhelm threats like Dondozo, Skarmory, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge with its excellent coverage while allowing Roaring Moon to maximize its own coverage instead of running Taunt. Fast Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder synergize well with Roaring Moon; Roaring Moon can serve as more of a wallbreaker alongside these threats, using its high immediate damage output and Knock Off to wear down or eliminate threats like Gholdengo, Clodsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight to enable their late-game sweeps. Dragonite can help overwhelm physical walls that Roaring Moon may struggle with while utilizing their alternate defensive profiles to cover Roaring Moon's shortcomings. Dragonite's Extreme Speed acts as a strong priority attack to deal with opposing priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, which can revenge kill Roaring Moon with Ice Shard and Thunderclap, respectively. Kingambit greatly appreciates Roaring Moon's ability to pressure Fire-types like Cinderace and Heatran, and in return its great bulk and typing can allow it to handle threats like Weavile and Meowscarada lacking Low Kick. Lastly, Roaring Moon can fit reasonably well on Psychic Terrain teams spearheaded by Indeedee; Psychic Terrain keeps Roaring Moon safe from opposing priority attacks until it activates Tera Flying, and such a playstyle helps facilitate offensive threats that Roaring Moon already synergizes well with such as Iron Boulder and Expanding Force Deoxys-S. Choice Band Roaring Moon is an elite physical wallbreaker on sun teams thanks to its phenomenal Attack and great Speed stats, either of which can be further boosted by its Protosynthesis. Knock Off is extremely spammable and difficult to safely switch into, giving Roaring Moon a strong STAB move that can even support the rest of its team with item removal. Outrage is a brutally strong STAB move that is impossible to switch into without a Fairy-type, easily allowing Roaring Moon to break past physical walls like Gliscor and Dondozo. Iron Head is used to hit Fairy-types such as Clefable and Enamorus for super effective damage; however Earthquake is an alternative to Iron Head that allows Roaring Moon to hit Steel-types, particularly Kingambit lacking Air Balloon, for super effective damage. U-turn is pivotal for maintaining momentum, allowing it to safely bring in threats such as Walking Wake onto the field. 220 Attack EVs and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature are necessary for Roaring Moon to attain a boost to its Speed via Protosynthesis, allowing it to always outspeed Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Alternatively, simply running maximum Attack and Speed EVs gives Roaring Moon an Attack boost through its Protosynthesis, letting it 2HKO Skarmory with Knock Off and Dondozo with Outrage, alongside always netting an OHKO on Kingambit with Earthquake. Tera Dark is the premier Tera type for this set, as it powers up Knock Off to unprecedented levels of power, inflicting heavy damage on Gliscor, Skarmory, and even Clefable, whereas Tera Steel can be used to gain STAB on Iron Head and to withstand Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks. This set functions best on sun teams, leveraging Torkoal to set the sun for Roaring Moon to take advantage of, with the former also checking Bug-, Ice-, and Fairy-types for the latter. Roaring Moon is vulnerable to repeated chip damage from entry hazards, which can wear it down very quickly if left unchecked. Hatterene and Great Tusk are much appreciated forms of hazard control that can also check some of the threats Roaring Moon struggles against, with Hatterene forcing out Dragon- and Fighting-types, namely Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and Great Tusk being able to force out Kingambit while generally acting as a reliable physical tank. Venusaur and Kingambit also pair very well with Roaring Moon on sun, with Venusaur forcing Primarina and Great Tusk out alongside Kingambit's reliability in taking on Meowscarada and Swords Dance Weavile. In return, Roaring Moon is able to soften up the opposing team for Venusaur and Kingambit to clean up in the late-game. Walking Wake and Raging Bolt can form an incredibly potent wallbreaking core with Roaring Moon, as both appreciate its Knock Off crippling their checks, and Raging Bolt can form a potent pivoting core with Roaring Moon that can easily take advantage of forced switch-ins."

    "text": "Draft Order: Round 6 onwards Price Range: 4-6 points Overview: Rotom-S is an underrated and surprisingly versatile addition to many draft teams. Its Electric typing paired with its Ground immunity makes it a strong low-budget option with a unique set of resistances. Rotom-S functions well as an early- to mid-game pivot, threatening Ground-types with Will-O-Wisp and using Volt Switch to wear down the opposing team, gain momentum, and bring in a strong wallbreaker. Rotom-S, however, is not a one trick pony; if given the right matchup, it can utilize Nasty Plot to perform well as a strong wallbreaker in its own right. It oftentimes struggles from a lack of coverage, usually relying solely on its own STAB moves, and while its Flying typing offers it a set of unique resistances, it often forces it to run Heavy-Duty Boots, which can limit its versatility. Bulky Utility Pivot: Rotom-S functions best as a pivot that can soft check multiple threats and regain some of its lost HP with Pain Split. Physically offensive Pokemon can be threatened with Will-O-Wisp, allowing it to use Volt Switch on the predicted swap. Many Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Landorus-T struggle to come in safely to block Volt Switch due to the threat of burn. Additionally, bulky pivot variants can also utilize dual screens and Volt Switch to enable another team member. Wallbreaker: Rotom-S can wallbreak through the combination of Nasty Plot and its dual STAB moves. Nasty Plot, Air Slash, and its ability to paralyze foes pose a potentially deadly combination due to Air Slash’s chance to cause foes to flinch, making it very risky for slower Pokemon to attempt to spam recovery moves in front of a boosted Rotom-S. Offensive Pivot: Though less common, Rotom-S can invest more in Special Attack and utilize Choice items to spam a faster or stronger Volt Switch. Bulkier Pokemon fear switching into this set due to the threat of being given a Choice item from Trick. Primary STAB Moves: Volt Switch, Air Slash, Discharge, Thunderbolt Setup Moves: Nasty Plot Utility Moves: Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, Trick, Thunder Wave, Light Screen, Reflect, Foul Play, Night Shade Coverage: Hex, Shadow Ball, Stored Power, Tera Blast Substitute: Substitute functions decently well on both status-spreading and wallbreaking sets. Behind a Substitute, an Air Slash flinch can be even more brutal for the foe. Eerie Impulse: Rotom-S can help neutralize certain special attacking threats, particularly Calm Mind sets from foes such as Ursaluna-B and Raging Bolt, using Eerie Impulse. Heavy-Duty Boots: Rotom-S’'s most common item by far, Heavy-Duty Boots allow it to avoid losing a quarter of its health to Stealth Rock, which would otherwise severely hinder its ability to tank hits upon switching in. Rocky Helmet: Rotom-S can effectively use Rocky Helmet to wear down physically offensive Pokemon that it might be switching into, such as Galarian Zapdos and Rillaboom. It also punishes opposing bulky pivots such as Corviknight. Choice Scarf: Rotom-S can use Choice Scarf + Trick to punish defensive Pokemon switching in. Otherwise, Choice Scarf allows it to use fast Volt Switch or spam Air Slash and hope to get rewarded with some luck. Light Clay: Rotom-S could have a role on dual screens offense team builds due to its access to Light Screen and Reflect. Light Clay's additional turns of dual screens allows another team member to set up more freely. Leftovers: Leftovers is useful to give Rotom-S extra longevity if the opposing team lacks good Stealth Rock users. Custap Berry: Custap Berry can be a neat surprise tool on Nasty Plot Rotom-S variants. After KOing one opposing Pokemon, using Endure against a subsequent revenger often forces the opponent to sack another Pokemon. Damage-boosting Items: Sharp Beak boosts the power of Rotom-S's Air Slash, which can help secure Nasty Plot sets specific 2HKOs against bulkier Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt. Magnet can have similar value to secure 2HKOs with Thunderbolt and boost Volt Switch damage without it having to lock into a move. Expert Belt also can have niche value on offensive sets depending on the matchup. Rotom-S functions quite well as a secondary Tera Captain. In fact, Terastallization offers it an actual use for its ability Levitate! Tera Steel and Fairy are strong defensive options that Rotom-S can use while still maintaining its Ground immunity. It can also use Tera Water to hit Ground-types and Tera Ground to hit opposing Electric-types. In general, having access to Terastallization greatly fixes Rotom-S’s issue of not having much type coverage beyond its STAB moves. While Rotom-S can pack a punch of its own, it should usually be drafted as a support option to enable higher-tier hard-hitters. It can be seen as a viable pickup especially on drafts that lack sufficient Pokemon that resist Ground and Flying. Rotom-S competes with other Pokemon like Eelektross and its Ghost-type counterpart Rotom for this role, but its Flying typing, ability to spread burns, and wide array of utility options set it apart from its competition. Rotom-S also soft checks many high tier Fighting-types that a draft might struggle with, such as Great Tusk, Galarian Zapdos, and Hawlucha. Physical Wallbreakers: Rotom-S can pivot out against specially defensive Pokemon, which safely brings in physical wallbreakers such as Iron Valiant and Garchomp. This can be especially useful when paired with entry hazard setting support from Pokemon such as Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu. Entry Hazard Removal: Due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, Rotom-S appreciates being paired with Pokemon that can remove entry hazards such as Iron Treads and Great Tusk. Wincons: Through weakening the opposing team with burns, paralysis, or even dual screens, Rotom-S is quite effective at turning opposing Pokemon into setup fodder, which can enable setup sweeping threats such as Ogerpon-W and Quaquaval. Stealth Rock: Although Rotom-S most commonly runs Heavy-Duty Boots, utilizing Stealth Rock can still be valuable to punish variants that use other items. Otherwise, Stealth Rock in conjunction with Knock Off is effective in wearing down Heavy-Duty Boots sets. Electric-types: Most Electric-types can exploit Rotom-S's lack of coverage and chew its dual STAB moves with ease. Special attacking Electric-types in particular switch in quite safely on it without fearing burn. Pokemon with the ability Volt Absorb such as Thundurus-T, Kilowattrel, and Lanturn are best at switching in, as they block momentum and also heal from Volt Switch. Fast Attackers: Strong, fast attackers with super effective STAB moves such as Weavile, Iron Boulder, and Kyurem can outspeed and threaten Rotom-S with super effective attacks. Substitute: Opposing Pokemon can use Substitute on Rotom-S's Will-O-Wisp to avoid being burned. Substitute paired with a setup move is especially threatening in front of Rotom-S, which might not be able to break the Substitute with the low-Base Power moves of Air Slash and Volt Switch."

    "text": "Rotom-H is a solid wallbreaker that offers a lot of utility, both offensively and defensively, in comparison to stronger special attackers like Delphox and bulkier pivots like Bellibolt. With its typing, bulk, and access to Levitate, Rotom-H can easily switch into walls like Mudsdale and Bronzong as well as offensive threats like Arcanine and either set up on them or pivot with Volt Switch. Pain Split makes Rotom-H more adept at dismantling defensive teams, simultaneously keeping it healthy and helping it overwhelm special walls like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and Florges. The move is an inconsistent source of recovery, though, so Rotom-H shouldn't rely on it too heavily. Investing in HP maximizes the mileage Rotom-H gets from its defensive profile and also gives it an easier time setting up and sticking around. Overheat's high Base Power means that it hits hard even without Special Attack investment. Thunderbolt and Discharge are alternatives to Volt Switch that are better suited for wallbreaking, don't force Rotom-H to switch out, and can paralyze foes, but pivoting with Volt Switch is a huge part of Rotom-H's viability. Tera Steel makes Rotom-H immune to poison, letting it set up on Toxic users like Bellibolt and Gligar, and resist Stealth Rock in case it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. It also helps Rotom-H stomach Normal-, Psychic-, and Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Toxtricity, Meloetta, and Duraludon while keeping most of its natural resistances. Tera Poison maintains the Toxic immunity in addition to flipping the script on Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-F and Pawmot. Both options synergize well with Levitate, though Tera Poison leaves Rotom-H open to Psychic-type moves from the likes of Galarian Slowbro and Calm Mind Florges. Rotom-H shines on bulky offense and balance teams, which best leverage its unique blend of offense and defense and benefit from it breaking through opposing bulky builds early- or mid-game. Gastrodon is nearly impossible for Rotom-H to break on its own and must be accounted for when using it. Strong physical attackers like Decidueye and Flamigo are good at pressuring Gastrodon as well as other special walls like Florges and Goodra. In return, Rotom-H covers these wallbreakers against revenge killers like Kilowattrel and Scyther; exploits nuisances like Bombirdier, Wo-Chien, and Houndstone; and gets them in safely against other walls like Scream Tail and Coalossal. A lure like Toxic Skuntank or Power Whip Goodra can either gradually or immediately get rid of Gastrodon, with both examples also softening foes like Gligar and Naclstack with Knock Off. Additional pivots like Flamigo, Zoroark, and Bruxish form strong VoltTurn cores with Rotom-H, which can be difficult for foes to withstand. While Rotom-H's bulk is good, it benefits from having proper defensive walls like Mudsdale, Galarian Slowbro, and Gastrodon to fall back on against stronger attackers while making up for their occasional passivity. Florges and Scream Tail are walls that also offer Wish support, which can reduce Rotom-H's reliance on Pain Split for recovery. Finally, Pokemon like Skuntank, Flamigo, and Mudsdale can absorb Knock Off for Rotom-H, ensuring that it doesn't lose its Heavy-Duty Boots while playing around foes like Scrafty and Copperajah."

  "Rotom-Mow": {
    "name": "Rotom-Mow",
    "text": "Rotom-C makes for a decent Choice Scarf user with its solid typing, useful moves such as Trick and Volt Switch, Levitate, and solid stats all-around. While Rotom-C's Speed is average, with the Choice Scarf, it still outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame, other Choice Scarf users like Hoopa, and Speed-boosted Pokemon like Rapid Spin Tatsugiri and Dragon Dance Scrafty. Rotom-C's typing is what differentiates it from other fast Electric-types like Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Toxtricity, letting it resist moves like Paldean Tauros-W's Wave Crash and Aqua Jet and threaten foes that can absorb Volt Switch like Golurk, Mudsdale, and, most notably, Gastrodon. While Rotom-C shares its typing with Hisuian Electrode, it is the preferred offensive option because it has naturally higher Special Attack, offers different utility moves, and does not need to hold Heavy-Duty Boots; Choice Scarf even allows Rotom-C to make up for its lower Speed. Thunderbolt gives Rotom-C a stronger Electric-type move and a more spammable STAB attack without the need to switch out or worry about stat drops. Discharge can help support slower teammates thanks to its high paralysis chance, and its lower Base Power is almost never a significant drawback. Electric is the go-to Tera type on Rotom-C, improving its ability to wear foes down with Volt Switch and clean up with either Thunderbolt or Discharge. Tera Electric also leaves Rotom-C with no weaknesses and allows it to tank certain moves like Brave Bird from Staraptor and Flamigo. Rotom-C will often click Volt Switch, letting it form a solid VoltTurn core with other pivots such as Scyther, Staraptor, Gligar, and Bruxish. This momentum ideally leads to the opponent switching a lot, making Gligar and other hazard setters like Duraludon and Qwilfish useful for building up chip damage. Being Choice-locked can leave Rotom-C very prediction-reliant, especially against foes immune to Volt Switch such as Gastrodon, Golurk, and Mudsdale. Gastrodon is especially notable, since it sometimes runs Sticky Hold for an immunity to Trick. Offensive checks to these Pokemon such as Meloetta, Staraptor, and Paldean Tauros-W help ease a wrong prediction, and the first two have pivot moves of their own. Teammates that can lure in and weaken these threats throughout the match such as Goodra, Ambipom, and Copperajah can also help with this. With Grass- and Dragon-types such Decidueye, Virizion, and Goodra resisting both of Rotom-C's STAB moves, it appreciates pairing with checks to them like Skuntank, Galarian Slowbro, and Florges, respectively. In return, Rotom-C offers resistances to some of their threats, such as Ground-types like Mudsdale and Steel-types like Bronzong and Copperajah. A handful of Electric-types such as Rotom-H, Kilowattrel, and Toxtricity also resist both of Rotom-C's STAB moves, so their own checks like Goodra, Gastrodon, and Golurk also come in handy. As Choice Scarf Rotom-C does not outspeed certain boosted setup sweepers like Shift Gear Toxtricity and Shell Smash Minior and other Choice Scarf users like Flamigo, it may be useful to have another form of speed control such as priority users like Extreme Speed Arcanine and Sucker Punch Skuntank. Rotom-C also loses its speed control capabilities after Trick, making these Pokemon even more valuable to have around."

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "name": "Rotom-Wash",
    "text": "Rotom-W thrives as a pivot within the tier thanks to its unique typing, solid bulk in tandem with access to Pain Split, and access to a great ability in Levitate. Hydro Pump gives Rotom-W an excellent STAB option and makes the life of Ground-types wishing to block Volt Switch such as Rhyperior and Excadrill hard. Volt Switch lets Rotom-W generate momentum on Pokemon that would easily take a Hydro Pump such as Azumarill, Tornadus-T, and Slowking. Will-O-Wisp helps Rotom-W cripple physically offensive threats that dislike being burnt such as Ogerpon and Excadrill while slowly chipping down any burnt Pokemon. Thunder Wave, on the other hand, punishes Tornadus-T and Latios by slowing them down while helping teammates take advantage of the Speed cut as well as the chance of paralysis. Pain Split in tandem with Rotom-W's naturally low HP stat allows it to recover a significant amount of health on foes like Hydrapple and Slowking, keeping itself healthy throughout the game. Leftovers is used to increase Rotom-W's longevity over the course of the match, letting it passively recover its health. Rotom-W is able to run two distinct EV spreads, both of which maximize its HP while allowing it to outspeed Adamant Scizor and Tyranitar. Investment into Rotom-W's Defense with a Bold nature lets it handle Sand Rush Excadrill and Metagross while living a Choice Band Hisuian Arcanine Head Smash. Rotom-W with a Calm nature and EVs in Special Defense make it a solid check to Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Zapdos. Tera Steel combined with Levitate removes the Ground weakness it would otherwise gain while gifting Rotom-W a spectacular defensive typing, letting it check Ogerpon-C and Latios better. Rotom-W's traits fit best on bulky offense teams that love its ability to cripple opposing Pokemon while pivoting on and off the field. Wallbreakers such as Ogerpon-C and Metagross fit excellently with it, being able to take advantage of Latios, Hydrapple, and Zapdos, which may want to switch into Rotom-W to block its shenanigans, with Metagross also functioning as a solid Latios check. Other pivots that synergize well with Rotom-W such as Lokix, Scizor, and Tornadus-T are excellent teammates, with Lokix and Scizor forming a strong VoltTurn core while handling Ogerpon, Hydrapple, and Latios for Rotom-W, while Assault Vest Tornadus-T can pivot into Latios and Keldeo for it. Ogerpon specifically both functions as a pivot and a way of punishing setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence and Calm Mind Latios with Encore thanks to Rotom-W's Volt Switch giving it free entry. Entry hazard setters like Tinkaton and Cobalion are fantastic partners for Rotom-W that support it with their strong defensive profiles. Hydrapple is an great check to Excadrill as well as the Ogerpon formes that appreciates Rotom-W's ability to handle Flying- and Ice-type types like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Mamoswine. Hisuian Arcanine functions excellently with Rotom-W, being able to maximize its offensive potential thanks to Rotom-W baiting in the likes of Hydrapple and Tinkaton for it, with Will-O-Wisp chipping down opposing checks like Mamoswine and Thunder Wave allowing Hisuian Arcanine to outspeed Pokemon like Latios and Keldeo."

    "text": "With Salazzle's deep utility movepool, it can act as great support Pokemon that lacks passivity thanks to its high Speed and its nearly unresisted STAB combination's damage output. Fire Blast is preferred for pure damage, but Flamethrower can be used instead for higher accuracy. Toxic + Corrosion allow Salazzle to break through bulkier Pokemon in the tier that other Pokemon simply can't like Galarian Slowbro, Qwilfish, and Gastrodon. Encore helps Salazzle take advantage of Pokemon that would otherwise wall it like Milotic, Gastrodon, and Mudsdale; however, Knock Off can be used instead to cripple item-reliant Pokemon like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, Gligar, and Duraludon. Tera Grass allows Salazzle to check Paldean Tauros-W and Golurk in a pinch. On the other hand, Tera Steel helps when facing Galarian Slowbro, Galarian Articuno, and Meloetta. Tera Ghost can also be used to ignore Fake Out and Extreme Speed from Ambipom and Arcanine, respectively, and in tandem with Encore, it can force them to continually do no damage to it, letting Salazzle attack freely. Salazzle easily handles Steel-types like Bronzong and Alolan Sandslash, so Pokemon that are checked by these walls work well alongside it like Florges, Galarian Articuno, and Grimmsnarl. If running Knock Off, Salazzle can help to chip away at opposing teams alongside entry hazard setters like Gligar, Gastrodon, and Alolan Sandslash. On top of this, Salazzle is also quite easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users and naturally fast Pokemon like Staraptor, Flamigo, and Kilowattrel, so walls like Bellibolt and Gastrodon help it defensively. Nasty Plot Salazzle is one of PU's most threatening setup sweepers and wallbreakers thanks to its great STAB combo, ability to outspeed naturally fast attackers such as Delphox, Zoroark, and Scyther, and wide variety of utility moves to benefit its sweep. Fire Blast is used over Flamethrower due to the higher Base Power allowing Salazzle to achieve rolls such as OHKOing Bellibolt after a Nasty Plot and Stealth Rock. Salazzle's final moveslot is very flexible; most commonly, it runs Encore to turn opposing setup sweepers like Decidueye and Paldean Tauros-F and walls such as Bronzong and Bellibolt into setup fodder and potentially deter them. Toxic cripples potential switch-ins like Gastrodon and Milotic as well as the aforementioned setup sweepers and walls. Finally, Substitute allows Salazzle to capitalize on the switches it forces on Pokemon like Wo-Chien and Alolan Sandslash, letting it either set up safely or fire off a strong attack. Like Encore, it also allows Salazzle to work around its mediocre bulk. Both Trailblaze to boost Salazzle's Speed and Tera Blast Grass to allow Salazzle to hit Gastrodon are options as well, but they are niche due to not providing as much value compared to other moves. Tera Dark allows Salazzle to gain a valuable defensive typing, allowing it to more easily set up on Psychic-types like Delphox and Galarian Slowbro. Alternatively, Tera Ghost also provides Salazzle setup opportunities—particularly against Choice-locked Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-F and Emboar—and can allow it to be immune to priority from Arcanine and Scyther, although it comes at a cost of being weak to other priority such as Shadow Sneak from Decidueye and Sucker Punch from Bombirdier. Nasty Plot Salazzle finds itself on offense and hyper offense teams as well as on balance teams looking for a reliable wincon and attacker that can be valuable before setting up by spreading Toxic or enabling other setup sweepers with Encore. While strong, Salazzle can find itself struggling to break against offensive and defensive Water-types. like Qwilfish, Gastrodon, and Milotic, so checks to these threats like one's own Gastrodon, Kilowattrel, and Decidueye make good partners. In return, Salazzle can aid these Pokemon by chipping down their checks like Wo-Chien and Bronzong. Salazzle's relative frailty means that slow pivots like Bellibolt and Gligar that can sponge a hit for it and bring it onto the battlefield safely are also valued. Other offensive teammates that can struggle to reliably break through Water-types like Arcanine and Scream Tail can form a solid backbone with Salazzle, as they work together to take down their shared checks. Although fast, Salazzle itself can still be revenge killed by faster threats such as Kilowattrel and priority from Arcanine and Decidueye; thus, checks to these threats such as Gastrodon, Paldean Tauros-W, and Wo-Chien all make good partners."

  "Samurott-Hisui": {
    "name": "Samurott-Hisui",
    "text": "Hisuian Samurott establishes itself as a top-tier dedicated lead thanks to its signature move Ceaseless Edge, letting it threaten the opposition while reliably setting up layers of Spikes that bypass common entry hazard preventions such as Hatterene's Magic Bounce and Taunt from Deoxys-S and Landorus-T. It does so while still maintaining a decent offensive presence courtesy of its strong Sharpness-boosted STAB combination and a bevy of disruptive utility options. Though weaker, Aqua Cutter is a perfectly-accurate alternative over Razor Shell that notably ignores common contact effects like Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Heatran's Flame Body, and Zapdos's Static at the cost of potentially missing out on the 2HKO against Ting-Lu. Aqua Jet reliably picks off opposing Focus Sash leads like Deoxys-S, Glimmora, and Ribombee as well as targeting other faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Alternatively, Sucker Punch lets Hisuian Samurott hit faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Choice Specs Dragapult, the latter of which can be problematic in the offense mirror. Aside from being handy against bulky foes like Skarmory and Pelipper, Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots works extremely well with Spikes, making the likes of Alomomola, Dondozo, and Unaware Clefable susceptible to them, which is especially helpful because the latter two can trouble the hyper offense teams that Hisuian Samurott supports. Either Taunt or Encore prevents Hisuian Samurott from being used as setup fodder by the likes of Raging Bolt and Kingambit, and it messes with defensive foes like Clefable. More specifically, Taunt stops Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Skarmory from setting hazards and prevents slower offensive threats like Dragonite from setting up. Alternatively, Encore is better at punishing naturally faster setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Defense Zamazenta, and Nasty Plot Darkrai looking for that one free turn of setup, and it can subsequently provide valuable switch-in and setup opportunities for an incoming teammate. Sacred Sword hits Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and opposing Hisuian Samurott; cleanly OHKOes Weavile, Darkrai, and bulky Kingambit; and breaks IronPress Zamazenta's Substitute. Focus Sash guarantees at least one layer of Spikes can be set even against faster foes like Enamorus, as well as opposing leads like Ribombee. Tera Ghost is predominantly used to spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. Hisuian Samurott's ability to set the pace for its team early-game makes it a perfect fit on hyper offense teams. Setup sweepers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon enjoy its Spikes putting foes into their KO range, especially against their checks like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and other Knock Off users like Bulk Up Great Tusk and Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo to make them vulnerable to Spikes. If not going for Knock Off, Great Tusk can also provide entry hazard removal for the team with Rapid Spin, since Hisuian Samurott will trigger lead Glimmora's Toxic Debris twice; pairing Hisuian Samurott with a grounded offensive Poison-type like Iron Moth can also mitigate this issue. In addition to enjoying Spikes, the aforementioned Iron Valiant and other Pokemon like Deoxys-S and Choice Scarf Enamorus are potent late-game cleaners that can notably pressure Great Tusk, preventing it from ever entering the field to use Rapid Spin. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult are valuable teammates to naturally spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads; moreover, Gholdengo is adept at preventing other hazard removal attempts such as Corviknight's Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Dragapult can deal with or revenge kill Zamazenta behind a Substitute, which uses Knock Off Hisuian Samurott as setup fodder. In return, they appreciate Spikes chipping down the likes of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl. With Sharpness powering up its STAB moves, Hisuian Samurott is a powerful attacker in addition to providing strong support for offensive teams with the Spikes it sets with Ceaseless Edge; it also has the ability to pivot safely thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots. Razor Shell and Aqua Cutter are comparably strong STAB options, the difference being Razor Shell trades a slight dip of accuracy for the ability to chip down walls with Defense drops, and Aqua Cutter is slightly weaker but is fully accurate and has a chance for damage to spike upwards with the higher critical hit rate while also avoiding contact effects like Rocky Helmet and Moltres' Flame Body. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Hisuian Samurott's foes and thus leaves them susceptible to the Spikes produced by Ceaseless Edge, as well as removing Rocky Helmet, which opens it up to keep attacking with its contact moves. As a support option, Encore is useful to lock Pokemon like Alomomola and Dondozo into setup moves, while Flip Turn can keep up momentum, help Hisuian Samurott escape from unfavorable matchups against slower foes like Primarina, and keep pressure on the opponent by pivoting between teammates smoothly. Heavy-Duty Boots provides Hisuian Samurott the immunity to entry hazards, which lets it be far more active throughout the course of a game. Tera Fire gives Hisuian Samurott an immunity to burns and provides it with a free turn against a foe attempting to burn it such as Moltres. It also flips Hisuian Samurott's weakness against otherwise problematic Grass- and Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Rillaboom, especially with Heavy-Duty Boots to mitigate its Stealth Rock weakness after Terastallizing. Hisuian Samurott fits well on offense teams and specifically is very useful on entry hazard stack structures. Stealth Rock users such as Landorus-T and Tinkaton make good partners for Hisuian Samurott, which also spreads entry hazards with Ceaseless Edge, creating hazard stacking cores to put pressure on foes. Hisuian Samurott's ability to pivot with Flip Turn synergizes well with other offensive pivots like Cinderace and Dragapult, allowing the team to pressure opposing Pokemon as well as pivot to any potential counters. Hisuian Samurott struggles to make progress on its own against bulkier Pokemon that resist its STAB moves like Alomomola, Dondozo, and Zamazenta. Zamazenta can easily dispatch Hisuian Samurott with a Fighting-type STAB move with no way for it to damage Zamazenta back. A strong Fairy-type like Enamorus or Iron Valiant can help deal with Zamazenta while also forming an offensive core with Hisuian Samurott, which can deal with threats to them like Galarian Slowking, easily switching in on Psychic-type moves like Future Sight. These Fairy-types also pose a threat to Hisuian Samurott, outspeeding and threatening it with Moonblast; teammates like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, Tinkaton, and Kingambit can cover these Pokemon, the former two adding to the offensive pressure of the whole team with more special attacks to complement Hisuian Samurott's physical attacks. Gholdengo especially synergizes with Hisuian Samurott, as it's able to efficiently block entry hazard removal and keep up the Spikes set by Ceaseless Edge. Kingambit, on the other hand, is similar to Hisuian Samurott, as it's a physical attacker and can help break down their shared checks like Dondozo and Skarmory over the course of a game. Together, along with other Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Hisuian Samurott can become a powerful part of Dark-type spam archetypes that can overwhelm shared counters such as Dondozo and Clefable. Galarian Slowking is another teammate that can deal with Fairy-types, shrugging off Moonblast as well as Fighting-type moves from Hisuian Samurott's counters like Zamazenta, which it can also force out with Future Sight. Hisuian Samurott also struggles against offensive Pokemon that outspeed it and can take advantage of that to pivot, such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Ogerpon. Having some speed control such as Ribombee's Sticky Web can assist with this while synergizing with the rest of Hisuian Samurott's hazards. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is a great speed control option due to its ability to compress a number of roles in one slot. It can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Cinderace and Dragapult while simultaneously setting up Spikes with Ceaseless Edge or pivoting into other teammates with Flip Turn. Razor Shell can make Hisuian Samurott more difficult to respond to due to its high chance to lower the enemy's Defense. However, Aqua Cutter can be used instead, as it is more accurate and does not make contact; this is useful against targets such as Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and Flame Body Moltres. Knock Off complements Ceaseless Edge by removing items such as Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots, making it more rewarding for Hisuian Samurott to use Ceaseless Edge later. Flip Turn allows Hisuian Samurott to pivot out of bad matchups against Clefable and Primarina while also dealing chip damage and generating momentum. However, Sacred Sword can be used to revenge kill various threats such as Kingambit and other Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a mediocre Terastallization user, as its base typing is important to check threats such as Gholdengo and non-Low Kick Kingambit, and its partners will usually benefit from Terastallization more. Nonetheless, Hisuian Samurott can benefit from the damage increase that either Tera Water or Tera Dark provide to revenge kill a wider pool of Pokemon. Tera Water is useful to revenge kill offensive Great Tusk and Landorus-T more reliably, while Tera Dark allows Hisuian Samurott to OHKO defensive Galarian Slowking and Latias with Ceaseless Edge after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Ghost is another worthwhile consideration, as it allows Hisuian Samurott to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott best fits on bulky offense teams, as it provides a great deal of utility between its defensive profile, ability to set up Spikes, Knock Off, and pivoting capabilities. Landorus-T is the perfect partner; it can form a potent pivoting core with Hisuian Samurott and provide Stealth Rock support while simultaneously benefiting from Hisuian Samurott's Spikes due to its ability to force switches with Intimidate and Rocky Helmet. Hisuian Samurott has a difficult time maintaining Spikes against entry hazard removers such as Corviknight and Great Tusk, as well as struggling against Fighting-types such as Zamazenta. Dragapult is thus a fantastic teammate; it matches up well against common switch-ins to Hisuian Samurott such as Corviknight and Skarmory and can block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Air Balloon Gholdengo is also an excellent partner, as it can prevent Defog from Corviknight, safely prevent Rapid Spin attempts from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, and check Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. In turn, Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge support makes Dragapult and Gholdengo more difficult to switch into due to wearing down their switch-ins such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Kingambit appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to lay down Spikes, as it makes it easier for them to clean late-game and break through checks such as Hatterene and Great Tusk. Future Sight support from Galarian Slowking is beneficial, as it makes it more difficult for Pokemon like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant to switch into Ceaseless Edge. Hisuian Samurott itself is quite vulnerable to being worn down by hazards, so anti-entry hazard support from Hatterene or Great Tusk is appreciated. While Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is relatively fast, it is still prone to being outsped by various setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Boulder. Priority support from Rillaboom or Dragonite is therefore recommended to have additional insurance against these threats. Hisuian Samurott is a Pokemon that, unlike other entry hazard setters, can offensively threaten teams while getting hazards up thanks to Sharpness-boosted Ceaseless Edge, allowing for more aggressive play and more opportunities to lay Spikes. Ceaseless Edge also lets it get Spikes up against Pokemon such as Hatterene and Taunt Deoxys-S. With Assault Vest, Hisuian Samurott is able to utilize its increased special bulk to check Pokemon like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Additionally, its decent defensive typing is useful for checking other threats like Weavile and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Razor Shell is generally the preferred Water-type STAB move due to its chance to lower Defense, but Aqua Cutter is a viable alternative due to it being non-contact and thus preventing chip damage from Rocky Helmet, which helps against Pokemon like Skarmory and Great Tusk. Aqua Jet gives Hisuian Samurott a priority move to pick off faster, weakened threats like Glimmora, Great Tusk, and Iron Boulder. Sucker Punch is another option for priority; it is not as reliable as Aqua Jet, but it is stronger and better at revenge killing Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Raging Bolt. Knock Off punishes defensive Pokemon that can impede progress, removing items from foes such as Dondozo, Skarmory, and Primarina. Alternatively, Flip Turn can be used to preserve momentum and safely bring in threats like Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W. 84 Speed EVs let Hisuian Samurott outspeed uninvested Gliscor; the leftover EVs are put into HP to increase its overall bulk. Tera Poison is used to remove its weaknesses to Fighting, Fairy, and Grass so it can take attacks from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Serperior. Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott fits best on entry hazard-stacking bulky offense teams that appreciate its offensive presence and ability to take special attacks. Gholdengo is an especially good teammate for Hisuian Samurott, since it blocks all hazard removal bar Court Change from Cinderace and has good matchups against Fairy- and Fighting-types that annoy Hisuian Samurott like Clefable and Zamazenta. In return, Hisuian Samurott soft checks Heatran and Iron Moth. Due to Hisuian Samurott's lack of reliable recovery, pairing it with Pokemon that have titanic special bulk or high longevity like Ting-Lu or Galarian Slowking is encouraged to cover special threats throughout the course of a game. Ting-Lu also has access to Stealth Rock, which, when paired with Spikes and Hisuian Samurott's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, can rack up serious chip damage on the opposing team. Alternative Knock Off users such as Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Clefable are good for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that never come in against Hisuian Samurott like Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and opposing Great Tusk. On top of being a premier pick for bulky offense teams, Great Tusk has the added perk of having access to Rapid Spin, removing hazards the opponent tries to set up so Hisuian Samurott can win the hazard war. Additionally, Rillaboom is able to provide Hisuian Samurott passive recovery thanks to Grassy Terrain. Other offensive teammates that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to set Spikes include, but are not limited to, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-W."

  "Sandaconda": {
    "name": "Sandaconda",
    "text": "Sandaconda is a good defensive Pokemon in SV ZU thanks to its bulk and Shed Skin. The increased reliability of Rest as recovery lends Sandaconda the longevity to check Pokemon like Grafaiai, Toxicroak, and Passimian. Options like Stealth Rock, Glare, and Coil diversify Sandaconda into a great support Pokemon or a bulky setup sweeper. Sandaconda is an excellent Terastallization user to boot, enhancing its defensive profile to become even tougher to break or enabling its own sweeps. However, Shed Skin does not make Rest perfectly reliable, hampering Sandaconda's consistency. Physical attackers like Hisuian Decidueye, Glastrier, and Virizion are very problematic for Sandaconda and coerce it to burn Terastallization for its team. Despite its Electric immunity, Sancaonda's lower special bulk can leave it to be overwhelmed by coverage and additional STAB attacks from Jolteon, Magneton, and Rotom. Sandaconda also faces competition from Regirock, another Stealth Rock setter that much more reliably takes on physical attackers like Snorlax, Glastrier, and Sneasel. Sandaconda is a great wall thanks to its natural bulk, Shed Skin, and Ground typing. Common physical attackers like Grafaiai, Toxicroak, and Regirock struggle to break through Sandaconda, and its great defensive profile enables it to consistently set up Stealth Rock. Rock Blast lets Sandaconda strike foes such as Articuno, Charizard, and Mismagius that it cannot touch with Earthquake. Alternatively, Glare lets Sandaconda spread paralysis and punish Pokemon like Hisuian Decidueye, Orthworm, and Virizion that it would deal little damage to anyway. Rest and Shed Skin can keep Sandaconda healthy, especially as it takes on Poison Touch Grafaiai sets and Hisuian Qwilfish, although the inconsistency of Shed Skin can leave it out to dry. Rocky Helmet helps Sandaconda further wear down physical attackers like Snorlax, Regirock, and Dudunsparce trying to break through it, and it enables Sandaconda to punish U-turn from pivots like Hisuian Decidueye, Grafaiai, and Passimian. Tera Poison makes Sandaconda a more reliable wall to physical attackers like Passimian, Sneasel, and Hitmonlee. Tera Ghost makes Sandaconda an even more sturdy wall to physical setup sweepers like Snorlax, Dudunsparce, and Regirock, improves its matchups against other physical attackers like Passimian and Toxicroak, and lets it spinblock Sandslash and Hisuian Avalugg. Tera Water helps Sandaconda handle Floatzel, Sneasel, and Glastrier. Sandaconda is a good physical wall for balanced teams looking to compress entry hazard setting on a teammate that isn't bothered as much by residual damage and status compared to Regirock, Orthworm, and Sandslash. Bulkier offensive teams also benefit from the utility and bulk Sandaconda offers in Glare and absorbing status from Weezing, specially defensive Dudunsparce, and Hisuian Qwilfish for offensive teammates. Hisuian Qwilfish makes an excellent hazard-stacking core with Sandaconda, and they complement each other's defensive flaws; Hisuian Qwilfish defensively answers Grass-types like Hisuian Decidueye, Virizion, and Whimsicott and Levitate Pokemon like Mesprit and Mismagius, while Sandaconda deals with Toxicroak, Sandslash, and Muk. Sandaconda's Water weakness makes teammates like Lanturn, Whimsicott, and Dipplin helpful for managing Cramorant, Clawitzer, and Floatzel. Sandaconda is not offensively threatening to walls like Cramorant and Articuno, so teammates like Magneton and Charizard can compensate for Sandaconda's poor matchup against them and have an easier time against said targets if Sandaconda has paralyzed them with Glare. Sandaconda invites in hazard setters like Palossand and Orthworm due to its passivity, so teamamates that can remove hazards like Hisuian Decidueye and Cramorant make good partners for Sandaconda. Sandaconda serves as a deadly late-game threat with the powerful combination of Coil, Rest, and Shed Skin. Earthquake hits most of the tier for at least neutral damage, while Sandaconda's other attacking move hits Pokemon that are immune to Earthquake like Bombirdier, Oricorio formes, and Braviary. Scale Shot allows Sandaconda to boost its Speed, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame except for Hisuian Electrode at +1 and outpacing common Choice Scarf users like Typhlosion at +2. Alternatively, Stone Edge doesn't drop Sandaconda's Defense and has more immediate potential to threaten Flying-types like Oricorio formes, Bombirdier, and Charizard. Rest acts as excellent recovery to keep Sandaconda healthy and combines well with Shed Skin to make it more reliable and help it serve as a wall in early- and mid-game scenarios, especially when combined with Tera Dragon to flip matchups on common Water- and Grass-types like Swords Dance Qwilfish and Hisuian Decidueye. Coil Sandaconda can opt to run less Speed in exchange for more bulk, with 224 Speed EVs and a neutral nature being enough to outpace base 110 Speed Pokemon at +1 and still outpace Choice Scarf Bruxish at +2; however, running these Speed EVs means it no longer outspeeds common Chlorophyll sweepers like Victreebel and faster Choice Scarf users like Mismagius and Floatzel at +2. Sandaconda can also opt to run Attack investment instead of HP, but this makes it more difficult to wall the foes it's tasked with setting up on late-game. Levitate users such as Mesprit and Mismagius serve as potentially problematic Pokemon, since they are immune to Earthquake and can become fully immune to Sandaconda's moves, if it's running Scale Shot, with Tera Fairy, so specially bulky teammates like Hisuian Qwilfish and Snorlax as well as faster teammates like Hisuian Electrode can be extremely helpful to counteract them. Orthworm poses similar issues due to Earth Eater and Iron Defense, so wallbreakers that threaten it like Charizard and Typhlosion are invaluable as teammates. These two as well as Bombirdier and Glastrier also threaten Grass-types, which cause problems for Sandaconda pre-Terastallization. Water-types pose similar issues while also often carrying super effective coverage for Terastallized Sandaconda, so teammates like Snorlax, Poliwrath, and Virizion benefit it greatly. In return for all of these potential partners' help, Sandaconda turns many physical attackers into setup fodder. Some common examples of Pokemon completely walled by it late-game include Passimian, Hisuian Qwilfish, and Rhydon; after Terastallization, this list expands to include other offensive threats like Bruxish, Qwilfish, and Hisuian Decidueye. Sandaconda has access to Body Press, which does hit Orthworm and Snorlax harder, but Rock Blast and Scale Shot provide better general coverage against most Pokemon immune to Ground. High Horsepower can be run instead of Earthquake if Thwackey is a teammate. Grass-types: Most Grass-types take little damage from Earthquake and threaten Sandaconda out with their STAB moves. Dipplin, Appletun, and Lurantis can wall Sandaconda in longer games. Defog Hisuian Decidueye and Toedscruel can remove Sandaconda's Stealth Rock and Rocky Helmet. Whimsicott and Calm Mind Virizion can easily take advantage of Sandaconda, though they don't appreciate Glare hurting their great Speed stats. Shaymin shrugs off paralysis from Glare thanks to Natural Cure. Tera Dragon and Scale Shot can give Coil Sandaconda some recourse against some Grass-types but can make its position against Pokemon like Dipplin, Whimsicott, and Dazzling Gleam Shaymin worse. Pokemon Immune to Ground: Ground-immune walls like Articuno and Cramorant can walk on Sandaconda, while Orthworm can use it as fodder for setting up Coil or entry hazards. Mesprit and Mismagius can use Sandaconda to set up, block its Glare with Substitute, and use Tera Fairy to completely wall sets with Scale Shot. The Oricorio formes can set up on Sandaconda and use Taunt to deny Glare. However, Ground-immune Pokemon weak to Rock, such as Charizard and the Oricorio formes, must be wary of Rock Blast or Stone Edge. Only Vikavolt and Rotom are immune to Glare. Special Attackers: Sandaconda's lower special bulk leaves it easily overwhelmed by Typhlosion, Jolteon, and Magneton, though all of them are OHKOed by Earthquake and must be wary of Sandaconda catching them with a defensive Terastallization. Calm Mind Dudunsparce is bulky enough to set up in front of Sandaconda. Water-types: Cramorant threatens Sandaconda with Surf, is immune to Earthquake, and can remove Sandaconda's Stealth Rock with Defog, but Sandaconda can punish it switching in with a Rock Blast or Glare. Clawitzer, Floatzel, Veluza hit Sandaconda for strong super effective damage and generally tolerate an Earthquake. Qwilfish is capable of finishing off Sandaconda but is vulnerable to Earthquake. Ice-types: Sneasel is powerful enough to overwhelm Sandaconda with a boost or some chip damage and can pick off Sandaconda's offensive Scale Shot set with Ice Shard even if Sandaconda has a boost, though it takes a lot of Rocky Helmet chip damage from Sandaconda when it uses Triple Axel. Glastrier is bulky enough to take two five-hit Rock Blasts from Sandaconda and threatens it with a strong Icicle Crash. While Frosmoth hits Sandaconda on its weaker special side, it is physically frail and very threatened by Rock Blast."

    "name": "Sandslash-Alola",
    "text": "Alolan Sandslash is a great role compressor, as it can remove entry hazards and set up its own, and on top of this, it can also check threats like Meloetta, Florges, and Rotom-C. While Triple Axel is more powerful than Ice Spinner, it must land all three times to do so, making the latter a more accurate alternative. Ice Spinner also removes Terrain, meaning it can also help out in more fringe cases versus Terrain setters like Indeedee-F and Thwackey to prevent Terrain sweepers such as Sceptile and Hitmonlee from gaining a Speed boost. Knock Off allows Alolan Sandslash to remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Choice Scarf from Pokemon like Altaria, Milotic, Paldean Tauros-F, and Flamigo. Removing Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to take advantage of its entry hazards to chip away at the aforementioned walls so that teammates like Paldean Tauros-W and Delphox can break through them. Spikes is preferred, as they can be stacked, and there are many more Stealth Rock users in PU compared to the number of Pokemon that learn Spikes. However, if there are no Stealth Rock users on a team or if Spikes are covered somewhere else, Stealth Rock can be run instead. Leftovers provides passive recovery for Alolan Sandslash, as it lacks any form of it, but Heavy-Duty Boots makes it be a more reliable spinner. The Speed investment helps Alolan Sandslash outpace Sandaconda. 20 Attack EVs allow Alolan Sandslash to always OHKO Golurk from full health if all three Triple Axel hits land. Tera Water both lets Alolan Sandslash take a Fire-type attack from Delphox, Salazzle, and Arcanine in a pinch and gives it a strong defensive Tera type. Tera Ghost, on the other hand, helps Alolan Sandslash act as an emergency spinblocker against Tatsugiri, Coalossal, and opposing Alolan Sandslash while also helping it take super effective coverage in Body Press from Mudsdale and Bronzong and Close Combat from Scyther. Although Alolan Sandslash easily fits on a lot of teams thanks to its good general utility, it fits best on entry hazard stacking teams that can utilize Spikes to great use alongside offensive pressure to chip away at and break through walls. This means wallbreaking partners like Zoroark, Heracross, and Delphox greatly appreciate Alolan Sandslash's support. Alolan Sandslash is easily beat by Fighting- and Fire-types like Hariyama, Paldean Tauros-F, and Arcanine, so teammates that can check these threats like Bellibolt, Milotic, and Mudsdale make for great partners and create a strong defensive backbone with Alolan Sandslash. Other Knock Off users like Heracross, Ambipom, and Scrafty pair well alongside Alolan Sandslash, as it can then fully utilize its hazards. Alolan Sandslash's lack of recovery can be quite detrimental versus Galarian Articuno and Florges, so a second specially defensive wall, like Goodra or Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, or a Wish-passing partner, such as Scream Tail or Florges, makes for a great teammate. Alolan Sandslash struggles against Steel-types like Bronzong, Duraludon, and opposing Alolan Sandslash, so Pokemon like Skuntank, Flamigo, and Paldean Tauros-F can all pressure them so that they can't take advantage of Alolan Sandslash. Wallbreakers weak to Stealth Rock and walls worn down by Spikes that also prefer to run other items instead like Staraptor, Arcanine, Gastrodon, and Galarian Slowbro have strong synergy with Alolan Sandslash because it can remove entry hazards for them. The former two pair especially well, as Alolan Sandslash can chip away at their checks like Mudsdale and Milotic with Knock Off and entry hazards. In return, Staraptor and Arcanine threaten out Fighting- and Fire-types like Flamigo and Delphox, respectively."

  "Scizor": {
    "name": "Scizor",
    "text": "Scizor is a potent threat in the UU metagame due to its combination of Swords Dance + Technician-boosted Bullet Punch providing strong revenge killing and cleaning abilities as well as its access to utility options like Knock Off and U-turn to allow it to function as a bulky pivot. Bullet Punch in tandem with Technician allows Scizor to pressure frailer, faster threats, notably OHKOing Ogerpon-C after Stealth Rock, Mamoswine after little chip damage, and Lokix and Latios at +2. Knock Off helps Scizor cripple common switch-ins like Zapdos and Mandibuzz by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots, as well as dealing super effective damage to Skeledirge and Metagross. U-turn does big damage to Pokemon like Slowking and Hydrapple, as well as allowing Scizor to escape bad matchups from Pokemon like Cobalion and Toxapex. 136 Speed EVs are used for Scizor to outspeed Adamant Azumarill, with the rest pumped into bulk. Tera Steel is used to add extra power to its already impressive Technician-boosted Bullet Punch, notably OHKOing Heavy-Duty Boots Tornadus-T at +2 and 2HKOing Azumarill. Alternatively, Tera Fire is used to flip its matchup versus Skeledirge and Hisuian Arcanine, allowing it to safely hit the former with Knock Off and hindering its ability to consistently switch in. It can also be used to absorb Will-O-Wisp from the aforementioned Skeledirge, as well as resisting Heat Wave from Tornadus-T. However, this gives up Scizor's good defensive typing, resulting in worse matchups against tier staples like Hydrapple, Rhyperior, and Excadrill, as well as taking more entry hazard damage should Scizor's Heavy-Duty Boots get removed. Scizor can also use Tera Electric to avoid getting paralyzed by Static from Zapdos, which would otherwise punish its contact moves. As an offensive pivot, Scizor does best on bulky offense and offense structures, able to use the fast-paced nature of such team styles to pivot around, provide item displacement, and revenge kill key threats. Rhyperior is a phenomenal teammate due to its ability to counter dangerous threats to Scizor like Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Hisuian Arcanine well as provide key Stealth Rock support to put threats like Ogerpon-C and Mamoswine into range of Bullet Punch more easily. Other entry hazard setters like Sandy Shocks and Cobalion also are good teammates, both forming a VoltTurn core to bring Scizor in against threats like Hydrapple, with Cobalion also being able to offensively check Lokix and Excadrill. Scizor also works well with the Pokemon that appreciate its free switches, such as wallbreakers like Latios, Mamoswine, and Azumarill. These wallbreakers provide the raw power needed to blast past Scizor's defensive checks and counters, like Cobalion, Toxapex, and Zapdos. Once these walls are gone, Scizor can clean up after a Swords Dance. Scizor also forms a potent core with other pivots, such as Zapdos and Slowking, with the latter able to take on the Fire-type moves thrown at it. Defensive partners include Pokemon like the aforementioned Slowking, as well as Rhyperior, Skeledirge, and Tinkaton; the latter acts as a primary check to Latios and Hydrapple so that Scizor doesn't get chipped down trying to switch into their attacks. Technician-boosted Bullet Punch is a big reason why Scizor is such a great late-game Pokemon and revenge killer once the opposing team is worn down. Close Combat is a great coverage move for Scizor, as it complements Bullet Punch well due to it being super effective against Steel-resistant Pokemon like Excadrill, Cobalion, Empoleon, and Tera Steel Hydrapple. Knock Off allows Scizor to force progress even against foes it cannot do much damage against like defensive Zapdos, Skeledirge, and Toxapex. Tera Fire gives Scizor the advantage against Pokemon that rely on burning it like Skeledirge and Rotom-W while making it so Fire-type attacks bounce off it, although Rotom-W can threaten it with a super effective Hydro Pump. Tera Steel powers up Scizor's Bullet Punch, allowing it to both break through foes and pick off weakened threats more effectively. Tera Electric is a great tool against Zapdos, Tornadus-T, and Thundurus-T, allowing Scizor to beat them one-on-one without being worried about Static, strong Electric-type attacks, and coverage. This Scizor set fits best on hyper offensive teams that can create a path to win late-game by weakening checks like Zapdos, Toxapex, and Rotom-W. Entry hazard support is a great way for Scizor to find itself in a scenario where the foes are weakened enough thanks to the chip damage of hazards from Excadrill, Mew, and Sandy Shocks. Excadrill is a great partner, as it can remove hazards so that Scizor doesn't get worn down by passive damage as quickly as it would otherwise. Alternatively, Mew and Sandy Shocks both provide Spikes alongside Stealth Rock to help wear down Scizor's checks more quickly. Sandy Shocks can also take on Zapdos and Tornadus-T while also luring in Hydrapple and removing it with Tera Blast Ice. Strong Pokemon like Ogerpon-C, Latios, and Thundurus-T can create opportunities for Scizor by punching holes against Pokemon like Zapdos, Hydrapple, and Mandibuzz. Keldeo and Greninja are Pokemon that Scizor might give free turns to fire off powerful attacks thanks to them resisting Bullet Punch, so Azumarill is a great partner, as it helps deal with these threats and pressures checks and counters that it shares with Scizor to help open up a late-game sweep. With a Choice Band, excellent STAB moves, good defensive typing, and amazing ability in Technician, Scizor proves to be a threatening pivot, wallbreaker, and revenge killer. Bullet Punch is an incredibly powerful priority move capable of picking off faster attackers like Ogerpon-C and Mienshao after Spikes chip damage, as well as 2HKOing Latios and Lokix. U-turn allows Scizor to switch out of unfavorable matchups such as Zapdos and Toxapex so that it can get a more reliable teammate in to handle them. Close Combat is an excellent coverage move for Scizor, allowing it to break offensive Steel-type Pokemon such as Excadrill, Cobalion, and Magnezone. Lastly, Knock Off is used to cripple and weaken Pokemon reliant on their items, such as Zapdos, Skeledirge, and Hippowdon, making them all easier to target. Tera Steel maximizes the power of Bullet Punch, allowing Scizor to hit even harder. Tera Electric prevents Scizor from getting paralyzed by Zapdos's Static. Scizor fits best on bulky offense and VoltTurn teams to make the most of its offensive capabilities. Offensive teammates like Ogerpon-C, Latios, and Zapdos are appreciated, as they can take on threats such as Toxapex and Keldeo for Scizor, as well as being able to dismantle the opposing team for it to begin sweeping. Defensive pivots such as Tornadus-T and Slowking work amazingly with Scizor, helping take on offensive threats it dislikes such as Greninja and Latios while keeping up momentum. Rotom-W is a great teammate, as it forms a VoltTurn core with Scizor that can handle one another's checks, with Scizor taking on the likes of Hydrapple and Ogerpon for Rotom-W, while Rotom-W removes Fire-type Pokemon that can threaten Scizor such as Skeledirge and Hisuian Arcanine. Entry hazard setters like Sandy Shocks and Cobalion help Scizor to get more value out of using Bullet Punch with the help of chip damage, while Tyranitar can set up both Stealth Rock and sand, which chip away at opposing Pokemon even quicker. Excadrill is a very important teammate for Scizor to have, as it can lure in Zapdos and remove it with a +2 Rock Slide and can take pressure off of Scizor by pivoting into Latios so it can preserve its HP."

Scovillain is one of Fire's best sweepers thanks to Chlorophyll. Under sun, Scovillain outspeeds a multitude of threats such as non-Choice Scarf Greninja and Chien-Pao. Growth is run for Scovillain to boost its damage output while under sun, letting it secure KOs more easily. Giga Drain threatens Pokemon like Ting-Lu, allowing Scovillain's teammates to break through them late-game, and it also aids in improving Scovillain's longevity by recovering its HP. Fire Blast can be used to have a chance of 2HKOing Skeledirge and Clodsire under sun, but Flamethrower is the preferred Fire-type STAB move, since its accuracy is higher than Fire Blast's. Stomping Tantrum hits opposing Fire-types such as Iron Moth. Solar Beam is an alternative to Stomping Tantrum, OHKOing the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Toxapex after Growth in sun. Life Orb and 32 Attack EVs maximize Scovillain's power, letting it 2HKO specially defensive Clodsire with Stomping Tantrum after Stealth Rock damage. If opting for Solar Beam, the remaining EVs go into HP. A Naive nature allows Scovillain to outspeed Choice Scarf users like Great Tusk and Iron Moth under sun while not losing out on Stomping Tantrum damage. Torkoal is a mandatory partner for Scovillain, as its ability to set up sun allows Scovillain to outspeed many faster threats like Iron Treads, Iron Jugulis, and Quaquaval, dealing heavy chip damage or outright KOing them. Scovillain appreciates Torkoal getting rid of entry hazards; in return, Scovillain deals with Water- and Ground-types like Gastrodon, Quagsire, and Sandy Shocks. Paldean Tauros-F is a great offensive partner for Scovillain, granting benefits such as breaking dual screens from Pokemon like Klefki and Grimmsnarl, which impede Scovillain's sweeping ability. Paldean Tauros-F is also able to check specially defensive walls like Blissey; in return, Scovillain breaks past bulky Water-types like Slowking and Toxapex after one Growth under sun. Cinderace can offer alternate entry hazard removal with Court Change, which helps Scovillain's longevity. Furthermore, Cinderace's Speed tier allows it to handle offensive Pokemon that naturally outpace Scovillain outside of sun like Hydreigon and Iron Treads, the former of which Scovillain cannot hit neutrally. Scovillain also appreciates Volcarona as an offensive partner thanks to its non-weather-reliant sweeping potential in Quiver Dance, dealing with Dragon-types such as Hydreigon and Garchomp, while Scovillain can weaken Volcarona's checks like Ting-Lu, Unaware Clodsire, and Toxapex throughout the course of the game. Scovillain turns up the heat on its Fire Blast with a Choice Specs set, burning up Clodsire and Skeledirge, which usually have no problem with its Growth set. It's notably also strong enough to score a 2HKO on physically defensive Toxapex after minimal chip damage, allowing Scovillain to beat Poison teams if it hits every move. Alternatively, Overheat has better accuracy and still 2HKOes Skeledirge and Clodsire, but the Special Attack drop makes it less spammable. Giga Drain threatens a 2HKO on Pelipper, which may be tempted to come into Scovillain to block Solar Beam, and also provides Scovillain a form of recovery. A Timid nature lets it outspeed threats such as Choice Scarf Gengar and Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake to burn them to a crisp, while a Modest nature has better odds of 2HKOing Toxapex with Giga Drain and OHKOing Baxcalibur with Flamethrower at the cost of outspeeding only up to non-Speed boosting Choice Scarf Sandy Shocks. Torkoal is a mandatory teammate, as it sets sun, which Scovillain needs to boost its Speed with Chlorophyll, and provides entry hazard support with its ability to set Stealth Rock and remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Other forms of entry hazard support in Defog Talonflame and Court Change Cinderace are also appreciated; they also have access to U-turn, which allows Scovillain to get in more times to wallbreak. Ceruledge packs Shadow Sneak to deal with Flutter Mane, which otherwise outspeeds and dispatches Scovillain with ease. In return, Scovillain obliterates bulky Unaware walls like Quagsire, Dondozo, and Skeledirge, all of which hinder Swords Dance Ceruledge from cutting down Water and Ghost teams. Similarly, Volcarona and Iron Moth love Scovillain's ability to eliminate bulky walls like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, allowing them to clean up Poison and Ground teams late-game. Skeledirge deals with Kingambit and Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which threaten Scovillain with priority or by outspeeding it and picking it off."

  "Scrafty": {
    "name": "Scrafty",
    "text": "Scrafty is one of the PU tier's most potent sweepers, finding ample setup opportunities thanks to its high bulk coupled with Shed Skin's chance to remove status conditions. Its defensive typing is also excellent, allowing it to shrug off attacks from foes such as Galarian Slowbro, Zoroark, and Bronzong. This is pushed even further thanks to Terastillization, allowing Scrafty to force opponents into guessing games over what moves will be effective. Dragon Dance boosts Scrafty's power while shoring up its rather poor Speed, alleviating the risk of being revenge killed by slow wallbreakers such as Rotom-H and Golurk. Drain Punch is used over Close Combat due to its ability to considerably extend Scrafty's longevity while maintaining reasonable power after a boost. Poison Jab allows Scrafty to threaten Florges with meaningful damage, while Ice Punch allows it to flip the script against Altaria and Gligar. Rest is an option in the last slot to give Scrafty a more direct means of recovery, but it generally does not want to drop its coverage option, and if Shed Skin does not activate, Scrafty becomes prone to being easily removed. The given EV spread allows Scrafty to outspeed Adamant Golurk while also avoiding the OHKO from Decidueye's +2 Leaf Blade after Stealth Rock. A spread of 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Speed with a Jolly nature can also be used to make Scrafty more immediately threatening at the cost of longevity and allows it to be less wary of opposing revenge killers without the need for multiple boosts. Tera Poison boosts the power of Poison Jab and flips Scrafty's otherwise poor matchup into Fairy-types such as Florges and Grimmsnarl, though one must be wary of Psychic Noise on the former, and other Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-W alongside giving it an immunity to Toxic. However, the newfound weaknesses to Psychic and Ground make Scrafty much more vulnerable to foes it can otherwise defeat handily such as Delphox, Bruxish, and Galarian Slowbro. Therefore, it should only be used in situations where it would guarantee Scrafty a setup opportunity or to prevent an attempt at revenge killing it after it has accumulated several boosts already. Scrafty functions as a potent win condition on nearly any team, utilizing the additional speed from Dragon Dance to limit offensive counterplay more effectively than Bulk Up variants. However, despite its snowballing potential, it does have a good few matchups it struggles with. Notably, Milotic and Altaria can shrug off Scrafty's attacks and dispel its boosts with Haze. In a similar vein, Mudsdale can keep up with Scrafty's onslaught thanks to the Defense boosts from Stamina, dissuade setup attempts by dealing respectable damage with Body Press, phaze it out with Roar, and punish Tera Poison with Earthquake. Therefore, Pokemon like Decidueye and Kilowattrel make excellent partners, weakening or outright removing these foes before Scrafty attempts to close out the game. In return, Scrafty offers a 4x resistance to Knock Off and can utilize its bulk in an emergency to shrug off weaker neutral hits that would cripple these frailer teammates. Scrafty also struggles considerably with Fairy-types due to needing to utilize Tera to have any sort of defensive matchup against them. Therefore, checks to these Pokemon such as Salazzle and Copperajah are greatly appreciated. Entry hazard support from Gligar, Coalossal, and Alolan Sandslash is also extremely helpful and pairs especially well with Knock Off's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon. Faster revenge killers are also problematic, as even after a Dragon Dance, Scrafty is still somewhat slow, so partners that can stifle these foes defensively such as Bellibolt and Coalossal and priority users like Decidueye that can pick them off are extremely valuable. Scrafty utilizes Bulk Up in conjunction with Rest, Shed Skin, and good natural bulk to become a strong setup sweeper that also provides valuable defensive utility as a special wall. Drain Punch and Knock Off are solid STAB moves that give it longevity, utility, and the ability to weaken Pokemon that like their items such as Gligar and Arcanine, all while forcing out special attackers like Galarian Slowbro and Delphox. Poison Jab is a fringe option that sees use mainly to hit Florges as it switches in, making it a shakier check; however, dropping one of Knock Off or Drain Punch can cause problems for Scrafty's ability to hit Ghost-types and its longevity, respectively, while dropping Rest means Scrafty lacks immediate recovery. Rest also synergizes well with Shed Skin, buffing Rest's recovery while giving it setup opportunites on status users like Bellibolt and Altaria, which is preferable to Intimidate. Tera Poison is mainly used for flipping Scrafty's otherwise horrible 4x Fairy weakness into a resistance, letting it set up on foes like Scream Tail and Grimmsnarl, as well as giving it a useful Fighting resistance for foes like Virizion and Flamigo. This is mainly a defensive Terastallization, though, and Scrafty is unable to properly threaten these Pokemon without outside support or some chip damage accrued beforehand. Being a specially defensive Pokemon, Scrafty appreciates physically defensive bulwarks like Bellibolt and Galarian Slowbro that can also take on Flying- and Fighting-types like Staraptor, Flamigo, and Paldean Tauros-W for it. In return, Scrafty helps check strong special attackers like Delphox and Zoroark. Offensive partners like Staraptor and Decidueye can wear down shared checks like Mudsdale and Bombirdier for Scrafty, and in return, they appreciate Scrafty removing items from these checks. Florges also deserves a special mention, as every set can OHKO Scrafty before it Terastallizes, and Psychic Noise sets can hit Scrafty even after Terastallization, so checks like Galarian Slowbro and Alolan Sandslash to help deal with it are heavily appreciated."

  "Scyther": {
    "name": "Scyther",
    "text": "Scyther is a great pivot thanks to its role compression of an offensive pivot, a Defogger, and a utility Pokemon all into one. U-turn allows it to gain momentum for its team, rack up chip damage on the likes of Galarian Slowbro and Gastrodon, and pivot out of Pokemon that it has issues with, like Bronzong. Close Combat lets Scyther deal with entry hazard setters like Alolan Sandslash and Coalossal while also providing good coverage into Pokemon like Dudunsparce and Abomasnow. Defog allows it to capitalize on the Pokemon it forces out like Wo-Chien and Paldean Tauros-W and subsequently remove entry hazards. Scyther has a variety of viable Tera types; most commonly, it runs Tera Ground, as it is an excellent defensive Tera type that lets it take on Pokemon like Kilowattrel, Rotom-H, Toxtricity, and Coalossal while also blocking Volt Switch. An alternative to this is Tera Flying, boosting the power of Dual Wingbeat while still removing Scyther's Bug typing to take on Fire-types like Delphox and Arcanine. Finally, Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat while giving Scyther a decent defensive Tera type, helping it handle Dark-types like Skuntank and Zoroark and changing its Rock weakness to a resistance. Scyther most commonly finds itself on bulkier balance teams looking to compress multiple roles into one Pokemon. Scyther makes an excellent VoltTurn core with Pokemon like Rotom-H and Zoroark, which can threaten physical walls such as Altaria, Bronzong, and Galarian Slowbro that can make Scyther's job difficult. As Scyther threatens Decidueye, Florges, and Wo-Chien, Pokemon checked by these threats, like Paldean Tauros-W and Toxtricity, can make good partners with it, and Scyther can help them get on the battlefield with U-turn and Defog. Scyther makes a good defensive backbone with Pokemon like Galarian Slowbro and Houndstone thanks to its ability to counter their few checks like Skuntank and Decidueye. In turn, they operate as a fallback for Scyther after it pivots out with U-turn against its problematic matchups. Coalossal and Bellibolt are issues for Scyther, as it can't reliably pivot on them due to Flame Body and Static, so checks to these threats like Golurk, Goodra, and Mudsdale are good partners. Thanks to a great Attack and Speed stat, wide array of coverage moves, Technician, and powerful boosting moves in Swords Dance and Trailblaze, Scyther is one of PU's strongest setup sweepers and attackers. U-turn allows Scyther to pivot out of bad matchups such as Bronzong and Houndstone, can bring a teammate onto the field safely, and can let Scyther gain momentum for its team. In contrast, Close Combat is a valuable coverage move to target Rock- and Steel-types like Coalossal, Regirock, and Alolan Sandslash. Trailblaze allows Scyther to operate as a dual setup sweeper, making it a bigger offensive threat by outspeeding faster Pokemon such as Salazzle and Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-F. Finally, Quick Attack is a valuable priority move, letting Scyther pick off setup sweepers such as Shift Gear Toxtricity and Nasty Plot Salazzle. Scyther's Tera type is extremely flexible; Tera Grass should be paired with Trailblaze, as it boosts the move while also giving it a useful defensive typing to set up on threats like Rotom-M and Paldean Tauros-W. Tera Normal lacks defensive advantages but boosts Quick Attack to great levels of power after a Swords Dance, achieving rolls such as a chance to OHKO Salazzle and Staraptor after Stealth Rock. Finally, Tera Ground is a purely defensive Tera Type type that allows Scyther to get setup opportunities against Pokemon it usually would not like Bellibolt, Toxtricity, Delphox, and Galarian Slowbro. Scyther finds itself primarily on hyper offense and balance teams looking for a consistent setup sweeper. Scyther struggles to break though physical walls like Bellibolt, Bronzong, and Coalossal if it does not run Close Combat, so checks to these threats like Golurk and Tatsugiri make excellent partners. Other offensive pivots like Staraptor and Rotom-H make a powerful VoltTurn core with Scyther, which can be difficult to stop and can bring Scyther in to safely set up. Scyther's ability to pivot can also be helpful for other frailer setup sweepers, like Decidueye and Zoroark, to get in safely and attempt a sweep of their own. If Scyther does not opt for Trailblaze or Quick Attack, it is extremely susceptible to getting revenge killed by Choice Scarf Flamigo and Staraptor as well as naturally faster Pokemon like Tornadus and Ambipom; checks to these threats like Bellibolt, Dudunsparce, and Duraludon make excellent partners. Pokemon like Virizion and Scrafty can switch into Knock Off for Scyther, as it needs Heavy-Duty Boots to be a capable sweeper."

  "Serperior": {
    "name": "Serperior",
    "text": "Thanks to its high Speed and plethora of move choices, Serperior cements itself as a strong utility Pokemon. Glare is a powerful option that can cripple common switch-ins to Serperior like Tornadus-T and Latios. When combined with Contrary, Leaf Storm allows Serperior to threaten foes by launching a powerful STAB attack that also boosts its power at the same time. Tera Blast provides Serperior with a strong, customizable coverage option; Tera Blast Electric nails foes like Tornadus-T and Mandibuzz while providing neutral coverage against Zapdos, Tinkaton, Metagross, and Scizor. Tera Blast Fire deals super effective damage to the aforementioned Steel-types as well as other foes such as Lokix and Zarude while also hitting Thundurus-T for meaningful damage. In addition, even without Tera, Tera Blast can act as strong enough neutral coverage against several foes that resist Leaf Storm. Alternatively, Dragon Pulse bolsters Serperior's coverage without the need for Tera, allowing it to hit foes such as Latios and Hydrapple for meaningful damage. Synthesis allows Serperior to restore its health in order to stick around longer, improving its longevity and helping it against more passive foes such as Slowking and Rotom-W. Knock Off and Substitute are also options to further cripple foes that Serperior has paralyzed and to take advantage of the switches it can force with Leaf Storm, respectively, but are generally not preferable due to being overall more prediction-reliant and less consistently useful than Synthesis. Leftovers increases Serperior's longevity and allows it to take advantage of the extra turns generated by paralysis while also being able to generate more setup opportunities for itself with Leaf Storm. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be used to improve Serperior's matchups against foes such as Excadrill and Ogerpon-C but further underscores Serperior's lack of immediate power. Tera Electric is used to provide a resistance to Flying, greatly improving Serperior's matchup against Zapdos and Tornadus-T, while also removing Serperior's weakness to Bug and giving it an additional resistance to Steel, making it less vulnerable to Scizor and Lokix. It also offers a handy immunity to paralysis, making Serperior safer against foes like Slowking, Rotom-W, and Cobalion. Tera Fire allows Serperior to offensively threaten foes it would otherwise be helpless against, such as Scizor and Tinkaton, but should be used with caution, as it does miss out on many of the notable benefits of Tera Electric while also making Serperior weak to Stealth Rock and more vulnerable to revenge killing attempts from Azumarill and Greninja. Glare Serperior fits best on offensive teams with slow and strong wallbreakers that can take advantage of its ability to spread paralysis, such as Mamoswine, Okidogi, and Hoopa-U. In addition, Serperior can soften up checks to these Pokemon such as Toxapex with Leaf Storm and can also clean out weakened foes after these wallbreakers have blown holes in the opposing team. These wallbreakers can also remove problematic foes such as Hydrapple that can shrug off Serperior's attacks with ease and are not overly threatened by paralysis. Tornadus-T also makes for an excellent partner, as it is able to check Latios, Greninja, and Hydrapple and can assist Serperior by pivoting it in against targets like Rhyperior and Slowking with U-turn or harassing its paralysis targets with Knock Off. Many Stealth Rock setters, such as Cobalion and Rhyperior, also greatly appreciate Serperior's ability to slow down their checks and give them more chances to set up the hazard, with the latter also appreciating Serperior's ability to threaten Excadrill. In return, Serperior appreciates the chip damage from Stealth Rock making its Contrary-boosted attacks even more potent and punishing Assault Vest Tornadus-T, which it notably struggles against. The aforementioned Cobalion, as well as Pokemon such as Zapdos and Okidogi, also provides a defensive out to revenge killers such as Lokix and Scizor. Skeledirge is also an extreme nuisance, as Serperior can not break it at all, so teammates that can handle it such as Greninja and Hoopa-U are appreciated. Serperior notably struggles with the tier's multitude of Flying-types without Tera, especially Zapdos, so checks to them such as Ogerpon-C, Thundurus-T, and the aforementioned Rhyperior are greatly appreciated, with Serperior softening up their checks in return."

    "name": "Shellder",
    "text": "Shellder is one of Little Cup's premier setup sweepers, with amazing power allowing it to OHKO many tier staples such as fast Mienfoo after Stealth Rock and the ability to outspeed all Choice Scarf users below 19 Speed after a boost. It also boasts a high Defense stat, allowing it to set up more easily against physical threats like Vullaby or withstand some priority moves, such as Stunky's Sucker Punch. With Skill Link, its coverage options Icicle Spear and Rock Blast can do even more damage than Liquidation to most neutral targets. Icicle Spear allows it to hit Grass-types super effectively, Rock Blast deals neutral damage to Water-types, and both allow it to OHKO Vullaby. If Shellder uses Tera Water, Liquidation can OHKO Pawniard after Stealth Rock and a boost and become Shellder's most powerful attack. If Shellder instead uses Tera Ghost, it will be immune or resistant to many forms of priority, including Mienfoo’s Fake Out, Timburr's Mach Punch, and Trapinch's First Impression. Shellder can fit on either hyper offense or bulky offense teams. Damage mitigation provided by dual screens from Impidimp, Will-O-Wisp from Gastly, and Memento users such as Stunky can ensure safer setup and, in Reflect's case, weaken priority moves. On hyper offense teams with dual screens or multiple Memento users, sweepers such as Magby and Nasty Plot Vullaby can break alongside Shellder, trying to either break common counters like Pawniard, force out opponents Terastallization, or set up on each other's counters such as Mienfoo. A team that can make significant progress for Shellder early- and mid-game is necessary when Shellder is used on a bulky offense team, since it is usually the main late-game wincon on these teams. Pokemon such as Mienfoo and Vullaby are very effective at damaging the enemy team as well as switching into other Pokemon, while Memento Stunky has defensive utility, can break, and can provide safe setup for Shellder. After setup, Shellder is weak to priority moves like Pawniard's Sucker Punch, defensive Terastallization, and the bulkiest Pokemon in the tier that it can't hit for super effective damage, including Mareanie, Snubbull, and more."

  "Shiftry": {
    "name": "Shiftry",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 2-4 points Overview: Shiftry boasts a wide and eclectic movepool as well as two excellent abilities in Chlorophyll and Wind Rider, which give it high potential as a very unique setup sweeper at an inexpensive price point. It can swap between physical, special, and mixed offensive stats and use its variety of coverage options and boosting moves to suit the matchup. However, its bad defensive stats, vulnerable type combination, incredibly average Speed, and mediocre offenses limit its capabilities. Chlorophyll Sweeper: Although it is generally outclassed by other Pokemon that can fulfill this role, Shiftry can be used on sun teams to fire off Solar Beam and Solar Blade at a more affordable price; however, its poor bulk makes finding opportunities to set up Growth a challenge. Even if it does not find setup opportunities, it can be a solid cleaner and revenge killer under sun with its many coverage moves. Setup Sweeper: Shiftry is the only Pokemon with the combination of Wind Rider and Tailwind, essentially giving it access to a bootleg version of Shift Gear. Swords Dance and Nasty Plot are options if raw power is necessary, but its poor base stats make utilizing these moves highly challenging. Offensive Utility: Defog, Leech Seed, Toxic Spikes, and Will-O-Wisp would be an astonishingly useful array of support moves on a Pokemon with better stats and typing, but unfortunately Shiftry must be very crafty to take advantage of these given its shortcomings. It can also use Knock Off to remove foes' items, Sucker Punch to catch foes off-guard with strong priority, and Taunt to interrupt opposing utility Pokemon and setup sweepers. Primary STAB Moves: Giga Drain, Energy Ball, Leaf Storm, Leaf Blade, Petal Blizzard, Dark Pulse, Knock Off, Sucker Punch, Throat Chop Setup Moves: Swords Dance, Growth, Nasty Plot, Tailwind Utility Moves: Brick Break, Defog, Leech Seed, Substitute, Synthesis, Taunt, Toxic Spikes, Will-O-Wisp Coverage: Air Slash, Extrasensory, Focus Blast, Heat Wave, Hurricane, Icy Wind, Low Kick, Rock Slide, Shadow Ball, Vacuum Wave, Weather Ball, X-Scissor Sunny Day: Chlorophyll sets can bring their own sun if need be, perhaps as a response to opponents’ attempts to change the weather themselves. Explosion: In situations where Shiftry lacks the power and coverage to break through the enemy, Explosion can punch an immediate hole in the opponent’s team, preserve momentum, and pass the torch to a different sweeper that may be able to take advantage of the remaining turns of harsh sunlight or Tailwind. Solar Beam / Solar Blade: Solar Beam and Solar Blade are the most powerful Grass-type moves Shiftry has access to, but they are relegated to Chlorophyll sets in harsh sunlight. Whirlwind: Shiftry does not typically have the stats to take advantage of Whirlwind, but by virtue of its Dark typing, it can check and force out some Stored Power sweepers. Damage-boosting Items: Shiftry often needs items like Life Orb and Expert Belt to hit KO thresholds that its average offensive stats cannot reach. Choice Band / Specs: Chlorophyll Shiftry can eschew setup and try to break through enemy walls unboosted, but its dependence on its coverage movepool can make it easy for foes to take advantage of once it is locked into a move. Lum Berry: Lum Berry can help Shiftry avoid status ailments from passive walls that it attempts to set up on. Heavy-Duty Boots: Shiftry is a poor choice for a Defogger, but Heavy-Duty Boots can give it a few more opportunities to switch in on entry hazards and attempt to remove them on offensive utility sets. Choice Scarf: Without sun support, Choice Scarf helps Shiftry function as a decent revenge killer. Focus Sash: Shiftry can use Focus Sash for a guaranteed turn to set up Growth or Tailwind, barring entry hazard damage or multi-hit attacks. However, this makes it especially vulnerable to priority attacks. Shiftry can be a solid secondary Tera Captain, especially on sun teams, but it is generally outclassed by other higher-priced Pokemon that are usually more threatening users of Tera. Tera Grass and Dark can increase the potency of its strong STAB moves to respectable levels, but Shiftry benefits more from types that can allow it to set up easier. Tera Flying, Fairy, Steel, and Poison can reverse its weakness to U-turn and offer it a few more coverage options, but Tera Fire synergizes the best with its role as a Chlorophyll sweeper and increases the damage of its sun-boosted Heat Wave even further. Shiftry is not the centerpiece of any draft, even on sun teams. It lacks the power and stats to be a reliable wincon, despite its impressive set diversity. However, on teams that can cover for its weaknesses and support its strengths, it may be able to surprise foes with its unique and potentially game-winning set of traits. Sun Setters: To take full advantage of Chlorophyll, Torkoal or Ninetales is a necessary partner. Shiftry should not be the only sun Pokemon on teams like this, as it is not sufficient to justify dedicating points to the sun archetype on its own. U-turn Answers: Due to its massive weakness to Bug, Shiftry wants teammates that do not fear U-turn and can punish the use of it with contact effects or Rocky Helmet, such as Landorus-T, Talonflame, and Zapdos. Wallbreakers: Shiftry’s coverage options are not infinite, and its stats can be insufficient to deal with strong walls, especially those with good mixed defenses. Pokemon with immediate power like Great Tusk, Raging Bolt, and Chi-Yu can punch holes in teams for Shiftry to attempt to clean up afterwards. Pivots: Shiftry hesitates to switch in on most moves except when it thinks it can take advantage of Wind Rider, so pivots such as Tornadus-T, Galarian Slowking, and Empoleon can help it hit the field safely. U-turn: U-turn deals more damage than a non-STAB Explosion to Shiftry and lets the opponent preserve momentum against almost any switch-in; as such, it is the bane of Shiftry’s existence. Almost any user of U-turn can turn it into a massive momentum sink or force it to Terastallize if it is a Tera Captain and deprive a likely stronger teammate of the option. Naturally Bulky Pokemon: Shiftry can strike foes on both the physical and special sides with the right EVs and coverage, but many Pokemon can shrug it off and KO it in return, such as Gliscor, Goodra, and Enamorus-T. Strong Priority: Shiftry is vulnerable to several common forms of priority such as Ice Shard, Mach Punch, and Vacuum Wave. It can also easily be revenge killed by most priority moves when brought to low HP by entry hazards, Life Orb recoil, and damage taken while setting up."

    "name": "Sinistcha",
    "text": "Sinistcha is a potent setup sweeper thanks to a variety of tools at its disposal: high Special Attack, great Defense, Heatproof, Calm Mind to shore up its Special Defense, and access to healing through Matcha Gotcha and Strength Sap, which can both also cripple opposing physical attackers. Strength Sap provides a way to get bigger bursts of recovery while also lowering the opponent's Attack, letting Sinistcha take hits from the likes of Lokix and Hisuian Arcanine and in turn use them to set up Calm Mind. Heatproof provides Sinistcha with a neutrality to Fire-type attacks, which is useful for taking on Hisuian Arcanine. Leftovers provides passive recovery alongside Sinistcha's healing moves, while Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it healthy through repeated switches. 96 Speed EVs let Sinistcha outspeed Adamant Azumarill, with the rest invested to maximize its physical bulk. Tera Poison allows Sinistcha to avoid Toxic from Mandibuzz and Toxapex and resist Okidogi's STAB attacks, as well as preventing Toxic Chain, while Tera Fairy can be used instead to help Sinistcha check Latios and Hydrapple while gaining a resistance to Dark-type moves from Tyranitar and Greninja. However, both of these Tera types take away Sinistcha's ability to spinblock, and Tera Poison makes it significantly weaker to Excadrill, so Sinistcha should only be Terastallized when necessary. Sinistcha fits particularly well on hazard stacking teams, where entry hazard setters like Excadrill, Cobalion, Sandy Shocks, and Rhyperior benefit from its spinblocking and incredible matchup against Excadrill, the tier's best Rapid Spinner. In turn, Excadrill provides an answer to Latios, which can threaten Sinistcha if it doesn't have any Calm Mind boosts yet, especially if it is using Tera Poison. Cobalion also makes an excellent teammate, using Justified to provide a great answer to many Dark-types, like Mandibuzz, which otherwise easily uses Defog in front of Sinistcha, and Zarude, which resists both of Sinistcha's STAB moves and heals off burns with Jungle Healing. Rhyperior and Sandy Shocks are teammates that can both pressure both Zapdos and Tornadus-T, which outspeed and threaten Sinistcha. Tornadus-T takes advantage of unboosted Sinistcha's middling Special Defense to OHKO it after minor chip damage, and Hoopa-U easily 2HKOes Sinistcha with Hyperspace Fury, so teammates like Latios and Lokix that deal significant damage to them are appreciated. Zapdos also makes a great teammate to punish Pokemon like Okidogi and Tornadus-T with Static, letting Sinistcha outspeed them. Skeledirge is a particularly annoying Pokemon for Sinistcha to deal with thanks to Unaware, so it needs teammates like Hisuian Arcanine and Greninja that can handle Skeledirge; these two also pressure the Flying-types that give Sinistcha issues."

    "name": "Sinistcha-Masterpiece",
    "text": "Sinistcha is a potent setup sweeper thanks to a variety of tools at its disposal: high Special Attack, great Defense, Heatproof, Calm Mind to shore up its Special Defense, and access to healing through Matcha Gotcha and Strength Sap, which can both also cripple opposing physical attackers. Strength Sap provides a way to get bigger bursts of recovery while also lowering the opponent's Attack, letting Sinistcha take hits from the likes of Lokix and Hisuian Arcanine and in turn use them to set up Calm Mind. Heatproof provides Sinistcha with a neutrality to Fire-type attacks, which is useful for taking on Hisuian Arcanine. Leftovers provides passive recovery alongside Sinistcha's healing moves, while Heavy-Duty Boots keeps it healthy through repeated switches. 96 Speed EVs let Sinistcha outspeed Adamant Azumarill, with the rest invested to maximize its physical bulk. Tera Poison allows Sinistcha to avoid Toxic from Mandibuzz and Toxapex and resist Okidogi's STAB attacks, as well as preventing Toxic Chain, while Tera Fairy can be used instead to help Sinistcha check Latios and Hydrapple while gaining a resistance to Dark-type moves from Tyranitar and Greninja. However, both of these Tera types take away Sinistcha's ability to spinblock, and Tera Poison makes it significantly weaker to Excadrill, so Sinistcha should only be Terastallized when necessary. Sinistcha fits particularly well on hazard stacking teams, where entry hazard setters like Excadrill, Cobalion, Sandy Shocks, and Rhyperior benefit from its spinblocking and incredible matchup against Excadrill, the tier's best Rapid Spinner. In turn, Excadrill provides an answer to Latios, which can threaten Sinistcha if it doesn't have any Calm Mind boosts yet, especially if it is using Tera Poison. Cobalion also makes an excellent teammate, using Justified to provide a great answer to many Dark-types, like Mandibuzz, which otherwise easily uses Defog in front of Sinistcha, and Zarude, which resists both of Sinistcha's STAB moves and heals off burns with Jungle Healing. Rhyperior and Sandy Shocks are teammates that can both pressure both Zapdos and Tornadus-T, which outspeed and threaten Sinistcha. Tornadus-T takes advantage of unboosted Sinistcha's middling Special Defense to OHKO it after minor chip damage, and Hoopa-U easily 2HKOes Sinistcha with Hyperspace Fury, so teammates like Latios and Lokix that deal significant damage to them are appreciated. Zapdos also makes a great teammate to punish Pokemon like Okidogi and Tornadus-T with Static, letting Sinistcha outspeed them. Skeledirge is a particularly annoying Pokemon for Sinistcha to deal with thanks to Unaware, so it needs teammates like Hisuian Arcanine and Greninja that can handle Skeledirge; these two also pressure the Flying-types that give Sinistcha issues."

    "text": "Torch Song allows Skeledirge to function dually as not only a defensive wall but also a threat that can overwhelm Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Hydrapple. Will-O-Wisp lets Skeledirge neuter many offensive threats such as Tyranitar and Okidogi, and it works in tandem with Hex to overwhelm defensive Pokemon like Slowking and Zapdos. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps Skeledirge from being worn down by entry hazards, letting it handle Pokemon like Okidogi variants lacking Knock Off and Calm Mind Latios more reliably. Tera Fairy is the most common Tera option, granting Skeledirge a very useful defensive typing that stops many threats like Hydrapple, Quaquaval, Lokix, and Calm Mind Latios, in addition to being a good neutral typing that helps it burn foes like Azumarill and Ogerpon-C. Tera Water lets Skeledirge check Azumarill, Greninja, Mamoswine, and Sand Rush Excadrill more efficiently. Tera Steel helps Skeledirge wall all Latios sets, Ogerpon, and Ogerpon-C while still checking Greninja, and Skeledirge gains a Toxic immunity, which can be useful for switching into Toxapex and Mandibuzz. However, every Tera type has downsides that flip certain matchups that may be unfavorable for Skeledirge. Tera Fairy makes it vulnerable to Metagross and Scizor, Tera Water makes it very weak to Zapdos and Hydrapple, and Tera Steel opens up a nasty weakness to Fighting- and Ground-type attacks that can be unfavorable, especially since it now loses to foes it should check, like Okidogi and Cobalion, ultimately meaning that general caution should be exerted when choosing to Terastallize Skeledirge. Skeledirge fits best on balance and fat builds that cover its defensive weaknesses and accommodate its need to Terastallize in-game. Switch-ins to Knock Off, such as Toxapex and Cobalion, are arguably mandatory teammates, answering critical threats that force Skeledirge out due to the threat of Knock Off such as Azumarill and Lokix. Cobalion offensively checks dangerous wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Ursaluna, and Ogerpon-C that can overwhelm Skeledirge. Slowking, Empoleon, and the aforementioned Toxapex form great cores with Skeledirge, answering annoying Water-types like Keldeo, Greninja, and Azumarill that typically force Skeledirge to Terastallize; not to mention, Toxapex and Slowking do a great job at checking Hisuian Arcanine, which can freely switch into Skeledirge. Slowking and Tinkaton can spread paralysis with Thunder Wave to boost the power of Hex while also being valuable scouts to see if Latios is running Choice Specs, which Skeledirge fails to check, or Calm Mind. Hydrapple and Mandibuzz are great teammates that can handle Mold Breaker Excadrill; both can serve as middle-grounds into Ursaluna while Mandibuzz can also provide support with Defog to clear entry hazards in the event that Skeledirge gets hit with Knock Off. Mandibuzz can also take out Pokemon that might reactively Tera into Fire-resistant Tera types to handle Skeledirge, like Excadrill and Scizor. Setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Excadrill and Calm Mind + Tera Electric Latios can remove annoying Pokemon like Toxapex, Mandibuzz, and Zapdos that stand in the way of a Skeledirge sweep with Torch Song. In return, Skeledirge's ability to spread burns can open up more opportunities for these teammates to set up."

  "Skuntank": {
    "name": "Skuntank",
    "text": "Skuntank's unique typing, ability in Aftermath, and movepool tailored for both stallbreaking and revenge killing establish it as a solid glue Pokemon in the metagame for a variety of team structures. Its typing allows it to check a variety of threats, such as Galarian Slowbro and Decidueye, which creates reliable opportunities to debuff walls like Mudsdale, Gligar, and Bellibolt on the switch, as not much in the metagame can resist its STAB combination of Gunk Shot and Knock Off. Sucker Punch is able to pick off weakened offensive threats such as Delphox and Toxtricity as well as Choice Scarf users like Staraptor and Rotom-C. Taunt is useful to stop the likes of Bellibolt and Milotic from healing freely and also inhibits setup sweepers such as Scrafty. Toxic can be used instead to cripple and wear down switch-ins like Mudsdale and Gastrodon. Rocky Helmet is useful to punish opposing Knock Off users like Scrafty, Bombirdier, and other Skuntank, as Skuntank is often the designated Knock Off absorber for many teams. Rocky Helmet also synergizes well with Aftermath to allow Skuntank to trade with contact-attacking threats like Arcanine and Paldean-Tauros W as needed. The boost from Black Glasses works exceptionally well with an Adamant nature and Tera Dark, as Skuntank can break through walls like Gastrodon and Altaria with these boosts stacked while also notably giving Adamant variants a guaranteed chance to OHKO Delphox from full with Sucker Punch. Some teams may opt for Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can be used to more reliably handle Decidueye for teams that need that support, avoiding the 3HKO from Spirit Shackle after Stealth Rock chip damage. A Jolly nature is useful to outspeed the likes of Goodra, Tatsugiri, and Jolly Bombirdier, while an Adamant nature can be used for additional power, for example, guaranteeing an OHKO against Golurk with Knock Off even without Black Glasses. Tera Ghost can be used over Tera Dark for its defensive merits versus certain Hyper Offensive sweepers; for example, Skuntank becomes immune to Boomburst from Toxtricity and Scream Tail as well as Curse Arcanine's Extreme Speed in a pinch and can then fire back with Gunk Shot or Knock Off. Skuntank functions well on entry hazard-stacking archetypes thanks to its ability to lure in and remove Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Bellibolt, Arcanine, and Milotic. Spikes setters such as Gastrodon and Coalossal are able to wear down offensive threats like Tatsugiri and Salazzle into range of Skuntank's Sucker Punch as well. Additionally, Skuntank is a valuable asset for hyper offense teams, providing role compression by being able to defensively check problematic threats like Decidueye while also supporting setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Scream Tail, Curse Arcanine, and Bulk Up Paldean Tauros-W by wearing down shared checks such as Coalossal, Mudsdale, and Milotic with Toxic and Knock Off support. These offensive threats also appreciate Skuntank's ability to pivot into one of their best answers, Galarian Slowbro, fairly reliably. Decidueye is another great partner with solid synergy, appreciating Skuntank's ability to take on checks like Scrafty and Wo-Chien and even wear down opposing Skuntank while Decidueye directly takes on Mudsdale, Gastrodon, and Paldean Tauros-W. Offensive Water-types such as Tatsugiri and Paldean Tauros-W appreciate Skuntank's ability to pressure Grass-types like Wo-Chien and Decidueye, while in return, they can switch into Ground-types like Mudsdale and Gligar immediately after Skuntank has crippled them with Knock Off. Skuntank's ability to offensively check the likes of Delphox, Decidueye, and Staraptor can also be beneficial for defensive pieces such as Wo-Chien and Bellibolt to not become overwhelmed, which can allow them to return the favor by better handling threats to Skuntank such as Mudsdale and Flamigo, respectively."

  "Slither Wing": {
    "name": "Slither Wing",
    "text": "Choice Band Slither Wing functions as an elite offensive pivot and priority revenge killer, comfortably finding a role on many team structures. First Impression is a strong STAB priority attack that capably dismantles setup sweepers like Necrozma, Maushold, and Mew. Earthquake is used to hit Poison-types like Fezandipiti, Gengar, and Slowbro post Tera that otherwise resist Slither Wing's STAB moves. Heavy Slam similarly hits Fezandipiti while also threatening an OHKO on the otherwise best check to Slither Wing in the metagame, Galarian Weezing. A Jolly nature is used to outspeed Adamant Revavroom, Necrozma, and Armarouge. An Adamant nature improves Slither Wing's ability to revenge kill with First Impression, forgoing the Speed advantage to maximize damage output. Tera Bug makes First Impression even more capable against setup sweepers that resist the move, like Revavroom and Salamence, and enhances the damage output of U-turn, as well as converting the weaknesses to Fairy and Psychic to neutralities, helping Slither Wing absorb attacks from faster threats like Fezandipiti, Choice Scarf Gardevoir, and Mimikyu. Tera Steel takes advantage of Slither Wing's deceptive weight offensively with Heavy Slam to OHKO Fezandipiti, and it gives key resistances to Fairy-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks from faster threats like Choice Scarf Gardevoir, Galarian Zapdos, and Mew. Tera Steel does, however, make matchups into Fighting- and Ground-types like Chesnaught, Hippowdon, and opposing Slither Wing more difficult. Balance and bulky offense teams appreciate Slither Wing for its ability to mitigate setup sweepers, break through defensive cores, and provide a strong presence as a pivot to support its teammates. VoltTurn cores with Slither Wing and Thundurus are notably difficult to check, as Slither Wing can threaten the specially defensive walls like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra that switch into Thundurus, while Thundurus can use moves like Grass Knot to threaten physically defensive walls like Hippowdon and Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Rocky Helmet. Defensive teammates like Amoonguss and Empoleon can support Slither Wing by switching into Fairy-type attacks from Pokemon like Fezandipiti, Gardevoir, and Galarian Weezing, with Empoleon also being capable of using Flip Turn to act as another pivot option. Slither Wing excels on teams that stack entry hazards, forcing switches because of its sheer power and allowing teammates like Chesnaught, Empoleon, and Krookodile to establish hazards and use Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Rocky Helmet on Pokemon that check Slither Wing like opposing Chesnaught, Galarian Weezing, and Salamence. Hazard control is important for Choice Band Slither Wing, as it pivots into the game multiple times and can be worn down by hazard chip damage. Teammates like Cyclizar and Noivern are great for keeping hazards off the field while providing pivot support, and Galarian Weezing can be a bulky teammate with hazard removal and utility. Offensive teams that use Endure Armarouge or Protect Yanmega can make First Impression less reliable as a priority attack, so Pokemon that can handle these threats like Dragon Tail Cyclizar and Empoleon make for great teammates."

  "Slowbro": {
    "name": "Slowbro",
    "text": "Thanks to its typing, high HP and Defense, and access to Regenerator, Slowbro does a fantastic job at slowing down or outright stopping some of the most dangerous wallbreakers and setup sweepers of the tier in their tracks, including the likes of Galarian Zapdos, Krookodile, Terrakion, and Barraskewda. In addition to being one of the best damage sponges in the tier, Slowbro also has a vast arsenal of offensive and disruption tools, including Scald, Psychic Noise, Thunder Wave, and Future Sight. These attributes allow Slowbro to trade hits remarkably well against many defensive pieces of the tier, like Jirachi, Cyclizar, Hippowdon, and Registeel. This resilience allows Slowbro to use Calm Mind in order to turn into one of the deadliest late-game sweepers the tier has to offer, ending games after it wins the war of attrition against opposing tanks. Despite all these attributes, Slowbro is not unstoppable in what it's set out to accomplish. Its typing and lower Special Defense leaves Slowbro vulnerable to the many Ghost- and Electric-type attackers roaming the tier, such as Gengar, Basculegion-F, Thundurus, and Magnezone. The strongest wallbreakers in the tier, such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos and Flame Orb Conkeldurr, can overpower Slowbro after minimal chip damage. Slowbro also struggles against wallbreakers with super effective STAB attacks, such as Crawdaunt, Bisharp, and Mimikyu, without expending Tera. Because the Pokemon that Slowbro checks often carry Knock Off, it often finds itself losing its item quite early, leaving it vulnerable to passive damage from hazards and status, particularly Toxic, without Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers to mitigate it. Calm Mind Slowbro makes for one of the best physical walls and late-game cleaners in the metagame. It acts as an excellent check to a wide variety of Pokemon such as Terrakion, Barraskewda, and Jirachi. Calm Mind allows Slowbro to turn into a threatening late-game cleaner capable of ending games easily. Scald can punish switch-ins to special sponges like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra and Dark-type physical attackers like Bisharp and Crawdaunt. Psychic Noise is preferred over Psychic and Psyshock to stop setup Pokemon from recovering, making matchups against Fezandipiti and Suicune more favorable and cancelling Amoonguss's Giga Drain and Conkeldurr's Drain Punch completely. Slack Off and Regenerator give Slowbro incredible longevity and the ability to consistently set up with Calm Mind during the course of the game. Heavy-Duty Boots is an excellent item that allows Slowbro to make full use of its ability in Regenerator to stay healthy throughout the game. Rocky Helmet is also useful, as Slowbro switches into the many Close Combats, Iron Heads, Liquidations while also checking Maushold and dealing damage passively. Tera Poison makes Slowbro immune to Toxic from the likes of Umbreon, Fezandipiti, and Quagsire; keeps its invaluable Fighting resistance while granting it a Fairy resistance and removes its Dark- and Bug- type weaknesses to consistently check Slither Wing, Mienshao, and others. Tera Fairy rids Slowbro of its Ghost-, Bug-, and Dark-type weaknesses Calm Mind Slowbro fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, as they enjoy its ability to check the many physical attackers running around the tier. Cyclizar makes for a great partner because it resists Electric- and Grass-type attacks and is immune to Ghost-type attacks, while Slowbro resists Fighting-type attacks and other strong physical attacks for Cylizar and its teammates. Cyclizar also acts as a sponge for the many special attacks aimed at Slowbro and as entry hazard control. Amoonguss pairs well with Slowbro because it forms a Regenerator core alongside Slowbro while preventing it by getting poisoned from the likes of Fezandipiti and Umbreon. Amoonguss also eases the pressure off of Slowbro by helping in answering the plentiful physical attackers in the tier. Hippowdon acts similarly in checking physical attackers while also aiding Slowbro against Electric-types like Rotom-Heat, whereas Slowbro switches into Water-type attacks for Hippowdon. Krookodile is a good partner for Slowbro, as it enjoys Slowbro's ability to check Fighting- and Water-types like Terrakion and Barraskewda, while Slowbro appreciates Krookodile's ability to set Stealth Rocks, remove items with Knock Off and take care of the Steel- and Ghost-types like Hisuian Goodra and Gengar that threaten Slowbro. Slither Wing is a great offensive partner for Slowbro because it invites Fezandipiti and Galarian Weezing for Slowbro and resists Dark-type attacks for it. Calm Mind Fezandipiti and Slowbro work well together, as they both weaken Steel-types like Empoleon and Jirachi for each other while doubling as Fighting-type answers. Fezandipiti and Jirachi are excellent teammates because they form great synergy with Slowbro and are good Pokemon in general due to their ability to spread status and act as pivots while throttling setup attempts with Taunt and Encore, respectively. Slowbro is among the best physically defensive walls in the tier with great bulk, multiple forms of recovery, and the ability to use Terastallization very efficiently against a good portion of the metagame. Scald allows Slowbro to punish switch-ins to Dark-types that come in to stop Future Sight, such as Bisharp and Overqwil while also threatening to burn specially defensive walls like Assault Vest Cyclizar and Empoleon. Future Sight has great damage output and enables Slowbro's teammates to force uncomfortable matchups during a game. Thunder Wave, similarly to Future Sight, can enable teammates to apply offensive pressure through forcing switches. Slack Off, combined with Regenerator, makes Slowbro very difficult to take down. A maximum HP and Defense Slowbro with Bold nature has seemingly unbreakable bulk on the physical side, comfortably switching into some of the premier physical threats like Barraskewda, Terrakion, and Galarian Zapdos. Tera Fairy is used to flip the weaknesses to Bug- and Dark-type, maintain the important Fighting-type resistance, and is generally a good Tera type defensively. Tera Poison keeps the Fighting-type resistance and can prevent Slowbro from becoming poisoned, usually the best means of taking it down, although it does make the matchup into Psychic-types like Reuniclus and opposing Slowbro more difficult. Future Sight Slowbro provides incredible offensive and defensive synergy within many team structures and is especially good on balance or bulky offense teams. Slowbro is often paired with other Regenerator users such as Amoonguss, Cyclizar, and Mienshao to form cores that are very difficult to break and can wear teams down offensively through hazard damage and gradual chip from U-turn and Future Sight. Slowbro can support teams through paralysis spam with other teammates like Bellibolt, Jirachi, and Thundurus, enabling offensive options like Basculegion-F and Gengar to take advantage of the boosted Hex damage or slow wallbreakers like Conkeldurr and Crawdaunt to outspeed most of the metagame. Slowbro generally likes to be paired with teammates that can absorb special attacks and are immune to Poison, such as Fezandipiti and Jirachi. To maximize the use of Future Sight, you often want to run physical attacking Fighting-types like Conkeldurr, Mienshao, and Terrakion, since Future Sight will lure in specially defensive walls such as Assault Vest Cyclizar and Empoleon as well as Dark-types like Bisharp and Alolan Muk. Covert Cloak protects Slowbro from Psychic Noise's heal blocking effect from Reuniclus and opposing Slowbro and status from Scald from Suicune and Fezandipiti's Toxic Chain. Colbur Berry reduces damage taken from Knock Off, making it safer to switch into threats such as Krookodile and Guts Conkeldurr. Body Press can be used to immediately threaten Bisharp and Cyclizar. Iron Defense makes Slowbro much safer against the likes of Revavroom and Mimikyu and is extremely effective against teams with little pressure on the special side when paired with Body Press. Trick + Choice Scarf cripples defensive Pokemon such as Wo-Chien, Empoleon, and Chansey that would otherwise answer Slowbro's other sets while allowing it to steal the foe's Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers after Slowbro absorbs Knock Off for its team. Choosing Psyshock over Psychic Noise allows Slowbro to beat opposing Calm Mind users not running Psyshock themselves. Special Attackers: Ghost- and Electric-type attackers such as Hisuian Zoroark, Basculegion-F, Thundurus, and Magnezone threaten huge damage on Slowbro, even after a Calm Mind boost. Other strong special attackers, such as Choice Specs Hisuian Goodra and Throat Spray Yanmega, can also overpower Slowbro. Powerful Physical Wallbreakers: Slowbro is unable to switch into the tier's strongest wallbreakers, such as Choice Band Galarian Zapdos, Choice Band Crawdaunt, and Facade Conkeldurr, without risking getting 2HKOed after minimal chip damage. Poison: Toxic poison is a death sentence for Slowbro, as it is then unable to stay on the field to threaten the attackers it tries to repeatedly stop over the course of a game such as Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos and completely invalidates late-game Calm Mind tactics. This often forces Slowbro to expend Tera to accomplish its goal against teams running Toxic Spikes or the likes of Toxic Fezandipiti, Gligar, and Umbreon. Bulky Water- and Grass-types: Wo-Chien completely stops Slowbro from making progress and almost always wins in one-on-one situations thanks to its typing, bulk, Leech Seed, and Ruination. Other defensive picks such as Grass Knot Empoleon and Shadow Ball Suicune can slow down Slowbro, but they have to be careful against Calm Mind Slowbro. Spikes: Because Slowbro will often lose its Heavy-Duty-Boots early in the game, Spikes stacking teams can force Slowbro to use Slack Off often, making it much more passive and vulnerable against the Pokemon it wants to check. This can drain Slack Off's 8 PP quickly. Disruption: Usual stallbreaking tools such as Taunt, Encore, and Trick + Choice Scarf slow Slowbro down considerably. Encore from the likes of Jirachi and Politoed and Trick + Choice Scarf from Gardevoir and Jirachi, entirely prevent late-game Calm Mind tactics from working."

  "Slowbro-Galar": {
    "name": "Slowbro-Galar",
    "text": "Galarian Slowbro establishes itself as a solid physical wall in NU thanks to Regenerator, letting it come in and check threats repeatedly without having to waste a turn healing. Its typing allows Galarian Slowbro to be immune to poison, allowing it to avoid Toxic from Umbreon, while letting it consistently check Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Breloom. Galarian Slowbro's deep utility movepool lets it support its team by whittling away at walls like Incineroar and Diancie with Toxic or slowing down threats like Munkidori and Inteleon with Thunder Wave. It also has access to Calm Mind, which allows Galarian Slowbro to take advantage of common defensive walls like Talonflame and Vileplume by making it harder to KO and switch into as well. On the other hand, it can choose to be more immediately threatening with Assault Vest, as it allows Galarian Slowbro to make use of its vast coverage, and it helps act as a blanket check to special wallbreakers such as Munkidori, Dragalge, and Porygon-Z. However, Galarian Slowbro's typing makes it weak to common Ground- and Dark-types like Flygon, Incineroar, and Alolan Muk. Galarian Slowbro is also susceptible to being KOed by repeated special hits from wallbreakers like Inteleon, Toxtricity, and Porygon-Z due to its below average Special Defense. While Galarian Slowbro checks Fighting-types like Toxicroak and Breloom quite well, other physical wallbreakers with neutral STAB moves like Heracross, Paldean Tauros-W, and Basculegion can easily overpower it or force it to Terastallize. Sludge Bomb is Galarian Slowbro's preferred STAB move, as it hits Fairy-types like Sylveon and Florges while also threatening foes like Incineroar, Flygon, and Swampert with poison. However, Psyshock can be used over Sludge Bomb, allowing Galarian Slowbro to deal with Poison-types and special walls like Toxicroak, Tentacruel, and Diancie more easily, and it also helps overwhelm opposing special setup Pokemon like Sylveon and Oricorio-E. Flamethrower allows Galarian Slowbro to hit Steel-types switching in on Sludge Bomb like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Tera Steel Sylveon. Alternatively, Surf allows it to target Incineroar trying to blank an incoming Psyshock. Rocky Helmet punishes physical wallbreakers like Mienshao, Cinccino, and Breloom; it also pairs well with Regenerator, as it allows Galarian Slowbro to consistently switch in to rack up chip damage. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Galarian Slowbro avoid damage from entry hazards, meaning its Regenerator can't be negated, while Leftovers gives it passive recovery, minimizing the need to heal off damage with Slack Off. Tera Water lets it handle Water-, Ground-, and Fire-types like Basculegion, Flygon, and Incineroar; however, Galarian Slowbro loses its matchup against Grass-types like Tsareena and Breloom. Tera Fairy retains the Fighting-type resistance and allows it to resist Dark-type attacks from Incineroar and Umbreon but makes it weak to foes like Copperajah and Toxicroak. Galarian Slowbro pairs best with bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Milotic to handle Ground-types such as Flygon and Swampert; in return, Galarian Slowbro checks Grass-types like Tsareena, Breloom, and Vileplume. Dark-types like Incineroar, Bombirdier, and Umbreon synergize well with Galarian Slowbro by beating Ghost-types like Chandelure and Brambleghast; in return, Galarian Slowbro handles Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Breloom. Galarian Slowbro appreciates Fighting-type teammates like Toxicroak, Breloom, and Paldean Tauros-W, as they can check Dark-types like Incineroar, Umbreon, and Alolan Muk, which threaten it. Physical wallbreakers like Flygon, Mienshao, and Infernape appreciate Galarian Slowbro's positive matchup against physically defensive walls like Talonflame, Vileplume, and Avalugg. Galarian Slowbro can form a defensive backbone with special walls like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Diancie, as they can check special wallbreakers like Choice Specs Meloetta and Toxtricity, while Galarian Slowbro handles the physical wallbreakers like Breloom and Toxicroak. Shell Side Arm is preferred over Sludge Bomb, as it will do more damage to special walls. However, Sludge Bomb can be used for its higher poison chance. Similarly, Psyshock hits special walls harder, but Psychic can be used for its raw power. Flamethrower allows it to hit Steel-types like Copperajah, Bronzong, and Klefki, while Earthquake targets Alolan Muk and Tentacruel with a trade-off of not hitting Bronzong and Orthworm. Ice Beam lets Galarian Slowbro hit Ground-types like Flygon and Gligar, while Surf targets Fire- and Rock-types like Chandelure, Talonflame, and Diancie. Grass Knot can be used as well to hit Water- and Ground-types like Swampert, Gastrodon, and Quagsire more effectively. The given Speed EVs outpace Quagsire. An alternative bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 128 Def / 4 SpA / 80 SpD / 44 Spe can be run with a Bold nature to live a +2 Wave Crash from Paldean Tauros-W and ensure that Shell Side Arm is a special attack, but Galarian Slowbro can fail to put its coverage to great use at times if it doesn't invest heavily in its offenses. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowbro handle Fire- and Water-types like Choice Specs Chandelure and Inteleon. However, Tera Fairy retains the Fighting-type resistance while letting it handle Dark-types like Incineroar and Umbreon. Bulky Water- and Grass-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, and Tsareena are great partners for Galarian Slowbro, as they can check Ground-types like Flygon and Swampert. Dark-types like Incineroar, Umbreon, and Wo-Chien appreciate Galarian Slowbro for checking Fighting-types like Mienshao, Toxicroak, and Breloom. In return, they can handle the Ghost-types like Chandelure, Basculegion, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Galarian Slowbro's typing leaves it weak to common Knock Off users like Incineroar and Alolan Muk. Thus, it pairs well with Pokemon like Bellibolt, Swampert, and Toxicroak, as they can check the aforementioned Knock Off users. Defensive walls like Bellibolt, Sylveon, and Tsareena are great partners for Galarian Slowbro, as they can check physical wallbreakers like Basculegion and Infernape. Physical wallbreakers like Life Orb Mienshao and Choice Band users such as Paldean Tauros-W and Flygon are great partners to form a wallbreaking core with Galarian Slowbro. Special walls like Bronzong, Milotic, and Incineroar can check special wallbreakers like Meloetta, Inteleon, and Chandelure, since Galarian Slowbro can't always beat them. Iron Defense + Body Press can be used to turn the tables against Dark-types like Incineroar, Umbreon, and Alolan Muk, but Galarian Slowbro is still easily forced out by special wallbreakers. Nasty Plot can be used over Calm Mind, turning it into a terrifying sweeper, but unlike Calm Mind, it forces Galarian Slowbro to switch out when it's up against special wallbreakers like Dragalge and Munkidori. Trick Room can be used on Galarian Slowbro to take advantage of it's low Speed and decent Special Attack, but without a boost, it struggles to pick up KOs. Colbur Berry lets Galarian Slowbro tank any Dark-type attacks such as Incineroar and Alolan Muk's Knock Off and Toxicroak's Dark Pulse so that it can respond with an attack afterwards, but the utility of its other items usually outweighs the benefit to using it. Eject Button allows Galarian Slowbro to become a one-time pivot, letting it safely bring in setup sweepers like Swords Dance Incineroar, Dragon Dance Flygon, and Nasty Plot Toxicroak for free. Galarian Slowbro could also opt to go itemless, as it can then wall Brambleghast and reduce Knock Off damage from Incineroar and Mienshao. Dark-types: Incineroar and Bombirdier can put a lot of pressure on Galarian Slowbro with their STAB attacks, but they have to be worried about getting poisoned by Sludge Bomb when switching in. Alolan Muk is especially noteworthy for being able to switch into its STAB attacks easily without worry of being poisoned, and it can respond with Knock Off. Ground-types: Flygon, Swampert, and Gligar can tank its Poison-type attacks and threaten Galarian Slowbro with their STAB Earthquake. However, the former two have to fear getting poisoned, and they all have to be cautious about switching into Ice Beam, Grass Knot, or Surf. Ghost-types: Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Brambleghast can easily destroy Galarian Slowbro with their STAB attacks. However, the former two have to fear about switching into Surf, while Brambleghast has to worry about Sludge Bomb damage and switching into a Flamethrower. Special Wallbreakers: Special wallbreakers like Choice Specs Meloetta and Inteleon can easily break through Galarian Slowbro and force it to switch out. Calm Mind users like Cresselia and Chandelure can put a lot of pressure on Galarian Slowbro too, but they have to be mindful of getting poisoned and switching into Psyshock and Surf, respectively."

    "name": "Slowking",
    "text": "Slowking leverages its good typing and Regenerator to be a great pivot in UU. Scald punishes foes trying to threaten it out such as Lokix and Ogerpon. Thunder Wave slows down foes such as Tornadus-T and Latios. On teams where the speed control is not needed, Future Sight is a good alternative to support its teammates with extra damage. Chilly Recpetion is key for bringing teammates in safely while pairing very well with Future Sight. It can also be used to clear sand. The first EV spread allows it to take on physical attackers like Mamoswine and +2 Excadrill, while the second EV spread lets it survive Choice Specs Tera Dragon Draco Meteor from Latios. 0 Speed IVs make Slowking as slow as possible to ensure that Chilly Reception can pivot in a teammate without taking any damage. Tera Fairy flips its weakness to Dark and Bug while gaining a Dragon immunity, letting it paralyze Greninja and Ogerpon while more safely switching into Hydrapple. Tera Water is a decent alternative that retains its Water resistance so it can still check Azumarill and Keldeo while boosting Scald’s damage, OHKOing Rhyperior and Excadrill with slight chip damage. Slowking fits best on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate the speed control and consistent pivoting. Hydrapple forms a fantastic Regenerator core with Slowking, as it can easily handle Ogerpon as well as shared checks in Lokix and Latios if it Terastalizes. Slowking can also use Thunder Wave to slow down Tinkaton and opposing Hydrapple. Lokix is another excellent partner for Slowking, as it can be brought in safely by Chilly Reception to revenge kill a foe like Excadrill. It is also able to threaten Dark-types, which are immune to Future Sight, such as Tyranitar, opposing Lokix, and Mandibuzz with Knock Off. Slower wallbreakers like Flame Orb Ursaluna and Mamoswine love Slowking slowing down Cobalion, Tinkaton, and Tornadus-T for them, while in return, they can both break through Zapdos. The latter also appreciates the Defense boost from snow, letting it easily take priority moves from Lokix, Scizor, and Azumarill. Zapdos and Thundurus-T are huge nuisances to Slowking, so Sandy Shocks and Rhyperior help handle them nicely. Slowking also appreciates teammates that handle Grass-types like Hydrapple and Ogerpon. Scizor and Assault Vest Tornadus-T form a good pivot core, with the latter helping on take on Latios for physically defensive variants. Skeledirge appreciates Slowking spreading status for Hex to deal more damage as well. Tinkaton can run Thunder Wave itself, opening up Slowking to use Future Sight while checking Ogerpon-C, Lokix, and Latios. Weather Ball users like Nasty Plot Tornadus-T, Thundurus-T, and Raikou also appreciate the Ice coverage from snow, allowing them to nail Hydrapple and Ogerpon-C."

    "text": "Galarian Slowking is an excellent defensive pivot thanks to good Special Defense, Regenerator, and a solid defensive typing. Future Sight allows Galarian Slowking to pressure a number of offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta and do significant damage to defensive foes like Toxapex and Clodsire. Chilly Reception alongside minimum Speed investment allows Galarian Slowking to serve as the metagame's slowest pivot, able to safely bring in offensive teammates safely while changing the weather to snow, which disrupts weather archetypes like rain and sun. Galarian Slowking has a number of options for its last move: Thunder Wave allows it to cripple fast offensive threats like Dragapult and Weavile while preventing Kingambit from freely switching into Galarian Slowking, Toxic wears down opposing walls like Ting-Lu and Dondozo as well as Thunder Wave-immune targets like Raging Bolt, and Slack Off offers immediate recovery, allowing Galarian Slowking to stay on the field longer. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowking stand up to powerful Fire-types like Cinderace as well as offensive Water-types like Walking Wake, while Tera Fairy gives it an immunity to strong Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Walking Wake and Raging Bolt. Tera Dark is another option that turns Galarian Slowking's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses into resistances, making it more resilient against foes like Greninja and Dragapult. 16 Defense EVs allow Galarian Slowking to live a Knock Off from Meowscarada. Galarian Slowking is an excellent choice for a pivot on balance teams, as frail offensive teammates like Iron Valiant appreciate being brought in safely as well as the pressure applied by Future Sight. Due to its average Defense, Galarian Slowking benefits from physically defensive partners like Skarmory to form a solid defensive core. Galarian Slowking struggles against special walls like Ting-Lu and Skeledirge if not running Toxic, so physically offensive teammates like Weavile and Hisuian Samurott that can take care of them make good partners. Additionally, Galarian Slowking is walled by Steel-types like Corviknight and Heatran, so teammates like Raging Bolt and Great Tusk that can remove them are necessary. Ground-immune teammates like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Corviknight are also good partners for Galarian Slowking due to its weakness to common threats like Great Tusk and opposing Gliscor. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can blanket check hard-hitting special attackers like Walking Wake and Enamorus, with Regenerator allowing it to maintain longevity throughout the course of a game. Moreover, the added bulk from Assault Vest means Galarian Slowking can afford to invest into its Special Attack, improving its offensive prowess significantly by making use of its colorful coverage options to be a respectable special attacker as well. Psyshock punches holes through special walls like opposing Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Clodsire much more effectively than its other Psychic-type STAB options and also immediately threatens Iron Moth, which can snowball past Galarian Slowking if given enough turns. It also allows Galarian Slowking to handle threatening Calm Mind users like Raging Bolt and Iron Valiant that can otherwise break past it with enough boosts. Sludge Bomb's poison can prove devastating against bulkier foes like Alomomola and Ting-Lu that can otherwise switch into Galarian Slowking. Flamethrower is useful coverage to hit Steel-types like Kingambit and Gholdengo, which would otherwise have ample switch-in opportunities. Ice Beam allows Galarian Slowking to hit Ground-types like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk while denting foes like Dragapult, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon. 16 Defense EVs let Galarian Slowking survive a Knock Off from non-Choice Band Meowscarada and 96 Special Defense EVs allow it to take two Choice Specs Kyurem's Earth Power. The rest of its EVs are pooled into Special Attack, letting it reach feats such as OHKOing Speed-boosting Iron Moth with Psyshock; 2HKOing Darkrai and OHKOing Rillaboom with Sludge Bomb; and 2HKOing Iron Crown and bulky variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit with Flamethrower. Tera Water gives Galarian Slowking a resistance to Water and Fire, allowing it to check Pokemon like Walking Wake, Primarina, and Iron Moth better, and drops its weaknesses to Dark-, Ground-, and Ghost-type moves, which allows it to act as an emergency check to Pokemon like Darkrai, Dragapult, and Great Tusk. Galarian Slowking is a recommended pick for balance and bulky offense teams due to it being able to check multiple top metagame threats like special attacking Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake while also having respectable offensive presence and respectable longevity. It has a lot of trouble dealing with Ground-type Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T, so Flying-types like Corviknight and Skarmory pair extremely well with it. Corviknight and Skarmory are also able to sponge physical attacks from other Pokemon Galarian Slowking struggles with like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit. Offensive partners like Rillaboom and Primarina can hit Ground-types instead of just simply walling them. Great Tusk itself is a great teammate for Galarian Slowking on the balance teams they fit on, serving as a Kingambit check and as entry hazard removal, especially versus hazard stacking teams. In return, Galarian Slowking is able to beat Pokemon like Enamorus, Walking Wake, and special attacking Iron Valiant sets for Great Tusk. Dragapult pairs neatly with Galarian Slowking, since it's also a frequent balance pick, serves as useful speed control, and appreciates Galarian Slowking being able to spread poison thanks to Sludge Bomb, allowing it to fire off Hex more frequently late-game without fearing Fairy-types stopping its sweeps. Gliscor fits on balance builds with Galarian Slowking, serving as a blanket check to physical attackers, a hazard setter, and a Knock Off absorber, along with having great longevity. Galarian Slowking is able to take advantage of the hazards Gliscor sets up by forcing switches with its vast array of coverage options, since many offensive threats prone to taking hazard damage like Primarina, Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Raging Bolt don't want to stay in and take repeated hits from it. Landorus-T is the Ground / Flying teammate of choice on bulky offense teams because of its better offensive presence and pivoting capabilities. Hisuian Samurott is another hazard setter that pairs well with Galarian Slowking, since it's able to soft check Pokemon that threaten Galarian Slowking like Weavile, Gholdengo, and Kingambit, whereas Galarian Slowking can take on Iron Valiant and Serperior for it while still retaining a threatening offensive presence thanks to its great coverage and solid offensive stats. Zamazenta is a great partner on bulky offense teams due to its favorable Kingambit matchup and ability to soft check many other physical attackers that threaten Galarian Slowking like Meowscarada, Ogerpon-W, and Weavile. IronPress sets can set up and sweep after Galarian Slowking has removed their checks and chipped the opposing team into KO range. Various other offensive Pokemon such as Primarina, Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, and Roaring Moon also greatly appreciate Galarian Slowking functioning as a defensive Pokemon with a notable offensive presence, allowing for more flexibility when teambuilding. Other bulky Regenerator Pokemon like Alomomola and Hydrapple can form Regenerator cores with Galarian Slowking, outlasting many offensive builds while covering each other's weaknesses. Alomomola can wall Fire- and Ground-types like Cinderace, Heatran, and Great Tusk, while Hydrapple is able to beat Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Hisuian Samurott, and Dondozo."

    "text": "With a Choice Band, Sneasler becomes an incredible attacker for Poison teams, being able to effortlessly remove foes such as Ursaluna, Skarmory, and Iron Hands. Close Combat, when boosted by a Choice Band, decimates Steel- and Dark-types, gaining OHKOs on threats like Archaludon and Ting-Lu and being able to 2HKO Skarmory and Gouging Fire. Dire Claw removes targets such as Primarina and Sinistcha with ease. Throat Chop removes Psychic- and Ghost-types like Latios, Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Dragapult; alternatively, Switcheroo cripples walls such as Toxapex and Sableye, which could otherwise effortlessly handle Sneasler. Finally, U-turn gives Sneasler a solid pivot option. Galarian Slowking pairs excellently with Sneasler, being able to use Chilly Reception to safely pivot Sneasler in against threats such as Latios. It can also use Future Sight, which allows Sneasler to break past physical walls such as Toxapex and Great Tusk. In return, Sneasler can bust through special walls like Blissey and Hisuian Goodra that handle Galarian Slowking. Alolan Muk handles Ghost- and Psychic-types that would threaten Sneasler such as Flutter Mane, Spectrier, and Galarian Slowking. Amoonguss can handle Water-type threats such as Dondozo and Choice Scarf Urshifu-R that would otherwise threaten Sneasler. Galarian Weezing provides a crucial Ground immunity thanks to Levitate, enabling it to take on threats such as Clodsire, Garchomp, and Dragonite. Galarian Weezing can also use Defog to remove entry hazards for Sneasler, preventing it from getting chipped down. Choice Specs Iron Moth can cleanly remove physically bulky threats such as Sinistcha and Okidogi along with handling threats such as Landorus, Gliscor, and Gholdengo. Pecharunt can come in on priority moves from the likes of Scizor and Hisuian Arcanine, threaten them with Foul Play, and then use Parting Shot to safely pivot Sneasler back in. Glimmora can check problematic Flying-types like Moltres and Tornadus-T along with being able to set Stealth Rock to wear down threats such as Gholdengo and Galarian Weezing. Overqwil can provides Spikes support as well as handle Iron Boulder. Sneasler is an amazing revenge killer on Poison teams, especially with a Choice Scarf, as it can outspeed the likes of Regieleki, Choice Specs Dragapult, and Roaring Moon with powerful STAB moves, spread poison with Poison Touch, and keep up the momentum with U-turn. Close Combat blasts through Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Iron Treads, and Hydreigon with ease. Dire Claw deals with the Ogerpon formes and Iron Valiant, and it has a small chance to inflict paralysis or sleep on would-be checks like Torkoal and Galarian Weezing. Gunk Shot may be preferred over Dire Claw for its ability to OHKO threats like Flutter Mane and Primarina while avoiding contact effects from its foe's abilities such as Zapdos's Static. Finally, Switcheroo can shut down physically bulky walls such as Skarmory and Toxapex, which would otherwise beat Sneasler. Alternatively, Throat Chop allows Sneasler to hit Ghost-type threats such as Dragapult, Spectrier, and Hisuian Zoroark, while Rock Slide removes targets like Volcarona and Iron Moth. With U-turn, Sneasler can easily pivot out to Alolan Muk to take on Psychic-type threats such as Espathra, Galarian Slowking, and Hatterene, which Sneasler cannot handle. Similarly, Overqwil can dispatch physical Psychic-type foes like Gallade and Iron Boulder while also providing Spikes, which can allow Sneasler to OHKO targets like Flutter Mane and Ursaluna. Amoonguss provides a solid check to Ground- and Water-type threats such as Great Tusk, Excadrill in sand, and Urshifu-R, which could otherwise handle Sneasler. Galarian Weezing provides a crucial immunity to Ground- and Dragon-type attacks that allows it to easily deal with foes like Hippowdon and Dragonite, use Defog to remove entry hazards, and enable Sneasler to come in safely. Toxapex can easily come in on priority users like Mimikyu, Scizor, and Hisuian Arcanine attempting to revenge kill Sneasler and handle them thanks to a combination of Rocky Helmet and Surf while also weakening Gouging Fire for an easy cleanup. Pecharunt and Galarian Slowking can provide Sneasler with safe entry by using their pivoting moves like Parting Shot and Chilly Reception, respectively. Pecharunt also provides support by being able to take on opposing physical walls such as Galarian Weezing and Araquanid. Galarian Slowking, meanwhile, can use Future Sight to cripple physical walls attempting to handle Sneasler such as Toxapex and Hippowdon. Glimmora can deal with Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos while setting Stealth Rock to help deal with threats such as Latios. Furthermore, Corrosion enables it to use Toxic to wear down targets such as Galarian Weezing and Corviknight, which otherwise wall Sneasler. Iron Moth provides a special attacking complement to Sneasler while being able to deal with physical walls such as Amoonguss and Skarmory. In return, Sneasler deals with special walls that cause Iron Moth trouble such as Blissey and Tyranitar. With a pair of Heavy-Duty Boots Sneasler can fill a unique role on Poison teams as an incredible offensive pivot, with its high Speed and Attack allowing it to handle targets such as the Ogerpon formes and Iron Treads with ease. U-turn combined with Heavy-Duty Boots will allow it to stay safe throughout the entire game by switching out against a threat to bring in a teammate that can deal with it; in addition, U-turn comes with a 30% chance to poison thanks to Poison Touch, which helps make progress by putting checks to it such as Quagsire and Mandibuzz on timers. Close Combat is a strong nuke against many of the tier's common threats like Hydreigon, Heatran, Kyurem, and Ursaluna. Dire Claw's incredible chance to inflict status allows it to not only slash through prominent Fairy- and Grass-types like Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and the Ogerpon formes but also make progress in matchups where its traits aren't as valuable like against Ghost teams by inflicting crippling statuses on targets like Hisuian Zoroark and Skeledirge. Finally, Fake Out can chip threats down and rack up poison damage or fish for poison before using U-turn to switch out. Alolan Muk handles the special Psychic- and Ghost-types attempting to remove Sneasler like Galarian Slowking, Flutter Mane, and Basculegion-F with its strong STAB Knock Off. Physically defensive Amoonguss can be brought in on many of the Ground- and Water-types that threaten Sneasler like Great Tusk, Quagsire, and Urshifu-R. Galarian Weezing provides a safe answer to Dragon-types like Garchomp and Dragonite, along with providing Defog support, should Sneasler lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Toxapex can deal with priority users attempting to pick off a weakened Sneasler such as Scizor and Hisuian Arcanine with its Rocky Helmet and Surf, along with being able to set Toxic Spikes to chip targets such as Hippowdon and Slowbro. Galarian Slowking provides a specially defensive complement to Sneasler by being able to handle threats such as Latios and Iron Moth while safely pivoting back and forth with itwith Chilly Reception; Its Future Sight combined with Sneasler's incredible Close Combat deals immense damage to any foe wishing to tank the hits for its team. Overqwil provides a switch-in against physical Psychic-types like Gallade and Iron Boulder and can set Spikes to wear down targets like Archaludon, which otherwise prove problematic for Sneasler. Glimmora provides support against Flying-types such as Gyarados and Tornadus-T, along with being able to use Corrosion Toxic to wear foes such as Skarmory and Pecharunt down, which would otherwise wall Sneasler. Glimmora also provides Stealth Rock to wear down targets like Gouging Fire and Rotom-W. Iron Moth provides a special attacking complement to Sneasler, as Iron Moth appreciates the removal of special walls such as Blissey and Tyranitar and, in return, can remove physical blockades that impair Sneasler such as Corviknight and Amoonguss. Unburden allows for Sneasler to become one of the fastest threats in the entire metagame, outrunning Choice Scarf users like Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Flutter Mane with ease. Air Balloon is the held item of choice, not only giving Sneasler a solid Ground immunity to threats like Gliscor and Clodsire, but also forcing them to choose between letting Sneasler set up with multiple uses of Swords Dance or popping Air Balloon so they can hit it with their powerful Ground-type STAB moves. Swords Dance's power boost is crucial in picking off physically bulky threats like Amoonguss, Hatterene, and Great Tusk. Close Combat is the STAB move of choice, hitting hard and breaking threats that attempt to take on Sneasler like Archaludon, Ursaluna-B, and Corviknight. Throat Chop hits Ghost- and Psychic-types attempting to absorb Sneasler's Close Combats, like Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Latias, hard. For Sneasler's last moveslot, Acrobatics can be used to make the most of Unburden with a strong move capable of breaking through threats like Gliscor and Zamazenta, which will attempt to stop Sneasler, while Dire Claw slices through bulky Fairy-types like Primarina, Hatterene, and Clefable. With Sneasler attempting to wallbreak as much as possible, entry hazards from the likes of Clodsire, Overqwil, and Glimmora can provide much needed chip damage against bulkier foes, like Toxapex and Skarmory, that may otherwise be able to take Sneasler on. Clodsire's Earthquakes can soften up walls like Toxapex and Forretress. Overqwil, with its solid offensive stats and part-Dark typing, can eat through Ghost- and Psychic-type threats, like Sableye, Ceruledge, and Metagross, that may attempt to stop Sneasler with their powerful priority moves. It can also weaken physical attackers with Intimidate, giving Sneasler an easier time setting up. Glimmora threatens bulky walls like Toxapex, Skeledirge, and Skarmory with the threat of Corrosion Toxic, putting them on vital timers and making them unable to check Sneasler late-game. Galarian Weezing's immunity to Ground-type attacks from the likes of Great Tusk, Clodsire, and Mamoswine makes it solid for wearing these threats down, and it's further capable of spreading burns with Will-O-Wisp to weaken physical attackers. Galarian Weezing also removes hazards with Defog to help Sneasler set up with as much health as possible. Amoonguss is able to handle strong threats with priority moves, such as Dragonite and Metagross, with Foul Play, which gives solid utility in picking these revenge killers off, and it is also able to put an opponent to sleep with Spore, giving Sneasler a free switch in and turns to set up Swords Dance. Pecharunt with Mean Look can trap physical walls like Skarmory, Galarian Weezing, and Toxapex and wear them down, making it a solid partner. Alolan Muk's strong STAB Knock Off can remove Ghost-types like Choice Scarf Gholdengo, Flutter Mane, and Spectrier. Iron Moth's strong Fire-type STAB move can melt bulky Steel-types like Corviknight and Skarmory, which may otherwise attempt to boost their Defense with Iron Defense to stop Sneasler. Iron Moth also takes out Flying-types like Gyarados and Mandibuzz with Discharge, as they otherwise may try to stop Sneasler with their high bulk and Thunder Wave and Foul Play, respectively. Okidogi appreciates Sneasler blowing through teams and can clean up weakened teams that have few threats, such as Kingambit and Hisuian Arcanine, remaining. This also works in reverse, where Okidogi first punches holes through a team and removes threats like Hisuian Zoroark and Porygon2, leaving Sneasler to clean up the rest. By virtue of its already great Speed tier further boosted by Choice Scarf, Sneasler makes for a great speedy threat on Fighting teams. Furthermore, a great ability in Poison Touch allows it to double as a potential status spreader. Dire Claw not only threatens Fairy-types such as Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Primarina but also makes a consistent way to spread status via its secondary effect alongside Sneasler's ability. U-turn allows Sneasler to bring in a teammate safely while also dealing great damage to Psychic-types like Hoopa-U and Latios. Switcheroo disables walls such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Archaludon, and thanks to Sneasler's Poison-typing, it doesn't need to fear obtaining Black Sludge from users like Alolan Muk and Toxapex. Alternatively, Rock Slide can be used to target Fire- and Flying-types like Volcarona, Moltres, and Zapdos, which can possibly hinder Sneasler's offensive capabilities due to the former two running Flame Body and the latter running Static. Toxic Spikes improves on Sneasler's status spreading by inflicting incoming foes without protection with poison. However, Switcheroo is the preferred option due to its potential in neutering walls. Great Tusk is a universal teammate for Fighting teams, as it provides Stealth Rock support to wear down incoming foes as well as hazard removal with Rapid Spin so Sneasler doesn't get worn down by Spikes. In return, Sneasler handles Grass-types like the Ogerpon formes, Rillaboom, and Hydrapple. Iron Valiant threatens bulky Fighting-types like Great Tusk and non-Choice Band Zamazenta with Moonblast as well as a multitude of threats like Pecharunt, Okidogi, and defensive Gyarados with its coverage. It appreciates Sneasler taking out Fairy-types like opposing Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Enamorus in return. Breloom makes for a great partner, as it can immobilize a check to Sneasler like Corviknight and Great Tusk with Spore, and it threatens Ground-types Sneasler dislikes such as Excadrill, Clodsire, and Gliscor. Water-type partners like Keldeo and Urshifu-R not only threaten the aforementioned Ground-types, but they also threaten Fire-types such as Volcarona and Moltres when Sneasler chooses to forego Rock Slide. The two of them appreciate Sneasler's potential status spreading weakening checks like Sinistcha and Dragonite so they can be removed later on. Iron Defense Zamazenta easily takes advantage of physical setup sweepers like Swords Dance Excadrill and Swords Dance Iron Hands while boosting the power of its own Body Press, while Choice Band variants threaten Ground- and Flying-types such as Garchomp, Landorus, and Dragonite. Iron Hands, with its great bulk and coverage, handles Flying-, Water-, and Poison-types such as Tornadus-T, Barraskewda, and Clodsire. Lastly, late-game sweepers such as Hisuian Lilligant and Agility Gallade appreciate Sneasler's ability to threaten Fairy-types and wearing down walls with both its status and Switcheroo so that they can start their own sweeping. Gunk Shot provides a solid but risky power boost over Dire Claw, being able to OKHO Galarian Weezing after a Swords Dance and entry hazard chip. Gunk Shot is also beneficial by not being a contact move, preventing activation of Flame Body from the likes of Talonflame or Volcarona, or Static from Zapdos, each of which can stop Sneasler in its tracks. Upper Hand can provide anti-priority utility by stopping priority move use from Chien-Pao and Kingambit, as they may attempt to pick Sneasler off after using Close Combat. A Jolly nature allows Sneasler to outspeed targets like the Ogerpon formes prior to its Air Balloon popping, as well as Adamant Barraskewda in rain. Taunt can be used to stop bulkier threats, like Toxapex and Galarian Weezing, that attempt to handle Sneasler, denying their use of recovery and status moves. Throat Chop can be used over Dire Claw, which provides Sneasler with an option to deal with Ghost-type threats such as Hisuian Zoroark and Froslass."

    "name": "Snorlax",
    "text": "Continuing its dramatic fall from grace from the higher tiers, Snorlax now establishes itself as a dominant force in ZU with its Curse sets. Thanks to its overall outstanding bulk and offensive versatility, Snorlax is quite difficult to stop once it gets stat boosts, even when factoring in Rest turns. Snorlax isn't just limited to late-game cleaning, either — it can also use said bulk and Thick Fat to function as a reliable sponge to common special attackers like the Oricorio formes, Jolteon, and Typhlosion while also being a good paralysis spreader with Body Slam. Walls comfortable switching into Body Slam also have to be aware of Heat Crash, limiting the consistency of its switch-ins. However, its low Speed and reliance on Rest or Protect for recovery make it quite easy to pressure it into passivity and cost momentum for its team. Snorlax's lack of resistances also makes it easy for Fighting-types like Virizion and Passimian to pressure it to Terastallize earlier than expected, which forces careful play to ensure a successful sweep. STAB Body Slam not only functions as Snorlax's primary attacking move but also threatens incoming switch-ins like Qwilfish formes and Hisuian Decidueye with the chance of paralysis. Heat Crash is a powerful coverage move that hits both Ghost-types like Rotom, Mismagius, and Oricorio-G that would freely switch into Body Slam and Tera Steel users like Hisuian Decidueye. Rest fully restores Snorlax's health and removes existing status conditions at the expense of making it passive for two turns. Alternatively, Protect scouts for Choice-locked foes like Passimian and Rotom and racks up additional Leftovers recovery at the cost of being unable to remove status. Tera Fairy turns its Fighting weakness into a resistance and provides an immunity to Dragon-type moves from foes like Dipplin and Alolan Exeggutor. Tera Fairy Snorlax also benefits from Poison- and Steel-type moves being uncommon. Thick Fat strengthens its defensive profile by making it a consistent switch-in to Fire- and Ice-types like Typhlosion, Charizard, and Frosmoth. Snorlax excels mid- or late-game as a setup sweeper that can take advantage of Fighting-types and wallbreakers being worn down. Physical walls like Qwilfish, Hisuian Decidueye, and Sandaconda shore up Snorlax's lower physical bulk and can provide entry hazards to wear down switch-ins like opposing Qwilfish and Dudunsparce; they are also excellent as Knock Off absorbers to preserve Snorlax's Leftovers. Choice item wallbreakers like Whimsicott and Jolteon can simulataneously provide wallbreaking and pivoting support for Snorlax to enter the field safely; they can help discourage physical walls like Palossand and Qwilfish formes from freely switching in. Poison-types like Qwilfish and Weezing can help with Snorlax's weakness to Fighting-types and provide additional utility. Rock-types like Regirock, Rhydon, and Hisuian Avalugg can easily ward off anything Snorlax can do, so checks to them like Virizion, Hisuian Decidueye, and Weezing are helpful to consistently force them out. Palossand stands out, as it can not only check the aformentioned Rock-types but also Fighting-types thanks to its excellent bulk and typing. Due to Snorlax's utility as a special wall and susceptibility to residual damage, Defoggers like Hisuian Decidueye and Cramorant are critical in preventing Snorlax from being worn down by hazards; the lack of hazards make it far more consistent walling foes and sweeping throughout a game. Snorlax's coverage move is quite flexible -— Crunch hits Ghost-types like Palossand and Drifblim harder, while Heavy Slam more heavily pressures Tera Fairy setup sweepers like Mesprit and Dudunsparce. However, Crunch is usually noticeably weaker compared to Heat Crash, and Heavy Slam worsens its matchup against Steel-types and Tera Steel Pokemon and is still walled by Rock-types. Sleep Talk over Curse makes Snorlax more consistent as a special wall at the cost of its late-game potential. Heavy-Duty Boots is a notable alternative to Leftovers, allowing Snorlax to fare better against entry hazards and easing the need for hazard removal. However, Snorlax usually appreciates the passive recovery from Leftovers better. Offensive sets like Choice Band are usable to surprise the opposition but are held back by Snorlax's low Speed and giving up quite a lot of its bulk. Rock-types: Rock-types like Hisuian Avalugg, Regirock, and Rhydon are not particularly bothered by even a boosted Snorlax and can set up Stealth Rock or pressure it with repeated uses of Body Press, with the latter two even using it as setup fodder. Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage: Fighting-types like Hisuian Decidueye, Virizion, and Passimian can threaten huge damage on Snorlax with their Fighting-type STAB moves, though none of them particularly enjoy it Terastallizing to Fairy. Hisuian Sneasel can even threaten Snorlax even when the latter Terastallizes with its Poison-type STAB moves. Pokemon with Fighting-type coverage like Clawitzer, Glasterier, and Braviary can also pressure it into Terastallizing sooner than expected. Strong Wallbreakers: Strong physical wallbreakers like Glastrier, Dodrio, and Braviary can strike at Snorlax's initially lower physical bulk and cause it to use Rest sooner than expected. Coil Sweepers: Coil sweepers like Orthworm and Dudunsparce can consistently keep up and eventually overpower Snorlax with their Steel typing and Dragon Tail, respectively, though the latter would need to PP stall a Terastallized Snorlax to win. While Sandaconda cannot outright beat Snorlax without critical hits, it can outlast Snorlax by PP stalling and can brush off status with Shed Skin. Item Removal: Snorlax's Leftovers is an essential part for it to wall and sweep teams; Knock Off users like Grafaiai, Mesprit, and Dodrio endanger its chances of sweeping and follow up with strong STAB moves in their arsenals. Trick and Switcheroo users like Whimsicott, Grafaiai, and Mismagius can outright neuter Snorlax's sweeping potential with a Choice item, forcing it out. Residual Damage: Snorlax hates taking residual damage, with common entry hazard setters like Orthworm, Qwilfish, and Sandaconda making it more difficult for Snorlax to sweep; the latter two can also rack up additional chip damage with Rocky Helmet. Status like burn and poison also forces Snorlax to use Rest, causing it to become more passive. Snorlax also can quickly get worn down by VoltTurn users like Mesprit, Whimsicott, and Jolteon as a switch-in to them, risking losing momentum against them."

    "text": "Snubbull fills a valuable role in Little Cup as a reliable Fighting- and Dark-type check through the combination of its pure Fairy typing and ability in Intimidate, allowing it to check common offensive threats such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Vullaby. Psychic Fangs allows Snubbull to hit Poison-types like Gastly and Foongus that otherwise wall it. Thunder Wave is a useful tool to hinder opponents, potentially giving Snubbull and its teammates free turns. Thief is a good option for Snubbull in the case that it loses its Eviolite, which happens in nearly every game due to its defensive profile. Earthquake is an option over Thief to hit Steel-types like Pawniard and Tinkatink, as well as OHKOing Hisuian Growlithe. Temper Flare is worth mentioning as well, as it lets Snubbull hit Steel-types and Foongus in one moveslot. The given EV spread allows Snubbull to effectively check the physical attackers it is tasked with taking on while ensuring it still has good power behind its attacks. Snubbull can Terastallize into the Steel typing to cover its weaknesses to Poison- and Steel-type attacks, additionally letting it both resist Vullaby's Brave Bird if Snubbull gets weakened enough for Brave Bird to otherwise KO and survive Snivy's Leaf Storm if it needs to. However, this has the disadvantage of making Snubbull weak to Mienfoo's High Jump Kick, as well as other powerful moves like Mudbray and Trapinch's Earthquake and Hisuian Growlithe's Flare Blitz. Beneficiaries of Snubbull include Stunky, which struggles into the Fighting-types that Snubbull can easily switch into. Mienfoo enjoys Snubbull checking Vullaby, as Vullaby can come in on all of Mienfoo's attacks and threaten teams with its powerful Brave Bird and Knock Off. Snubbull is a decent partner for Pawniard, as Snubbull can switch into Mienfoo's High Jump Kick for Pawniard. Slow, strong Pokemon like Mudbray and Timburr appreciate Snubbull using Thunder Wave to slow down opposing Pokemon. Snubbull itself is threatened by Poison-types such as Foongus and Gastly, with Foongus being able to tank more than one Psychic Fangs and threaten Snubbull with either Sludge Bomb or Spore, while Gastly can threaten an OHKO with Sludge Bomb. Gothita can cover Foongus by trapping it with Shadow Tag, while Stunky can handle Gastly with its natural typing and Knock Off but should be wary of Will-O-Wisp."

    "text": "Primordial Sea Solgaleo is most notable for its ability to wall Eternatus, and it also serves as a solid defensive answer to threats like Ultra Necrozma, Desolate Land Mega Blaziken, and non-Headlong Rush Kyurem-B. Psychic Noise deals respectable damage against Eternatus and prevents it, along with potential switch-ins like Arceus formes, from using Strength Sap. Flip Turn is boosted by Primordial Sea and can deal minor chip damage, while Teleport provides slow pivoting despite Solgaleo's high Speed. Gigaton Hammer pressures Fairy-types like Mega Audino and dissuades Blissey from attempting to block Strength Sap. Spikes can help reduce Solgaleo's passivity against many defensive Pokemon. An Impish nature guarantees Solgaleo isn't 2HKOed by Sheer Force Ultra Necrozma's Bolt Strike, while Jolly allows Solgaleo to outrun Mega Blaziken and Mega Gardevoir. Solgaleo is useful when paired with threats like Ultra Necrozma, which usually require specific allies to Imposter-proof. Defensively, Solgaleo struggles against threats like Moongeist Beam users, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Garchomp, making walls like RegenVest Primal Kyogre and Fur Coat Fairy-types good teammates. Solgaleo can be Imposter-proofed by numerous options, but RegenVest users in particular do not care about Psychic Noise and can maintain momentum."

  "Stratagem": {
    "name": "Stratagem",
    "text": "Meteor Beam Stratagem is a terrifying wallbreaker due to its blazing Speed stat, great coverage options, and excellence at breaking holes through walls such as Equilibra and Ting-Lu. It can also serve as an excellent wincon once checks such as Galarian Slowking and Arghonaut have been weakened. Due to its frailty, Stratagem usually needs to come in on a free switch such as when an ally is KOed, although it is able to switch into Landorus-T and Mollux relatively safely. Energy Ball provides coverage against Arghonaut, Cresceidon, and Ting-Lu, although Stratagem is not guaranteed to OHKO these foes. Fire Blast is essential coverage, allowing Stratagem to deal large amounts of damage to the Steel-types that would otherwise wall it such as Equilibra and Gholdengo. Tera Fire strengthens Fire Blast and allows Stratagem to beat Equilibra and Heatran consistently thanks to Levitate while also OHKOing offensive Gholdengo. It also allows Stratagem to resist Pixilate Extreme Speed from Hemogoblin and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom, making it harder to revenge kill. Tera Grass allows Stratagem to 2HKO Arghonaut and Ting-Lu at +1 while also OHKOing Cresceidon at +1 if Multiscale is broken prior. Stratagem fits best on hyper offense teams and can serve different uses depending on the matchup. Against balance structures, Stratagem serves as an excellent wallbreaker and paves the way for teammates such as Chuggalong and Iron Moth to sweep. Against hyper offense teams, Stratagem can easily be a late-game wincon, since it is hard to revenge kill once Booster Energy has been expended from threats such as Iron Valiant and Iron Moth. Entry hazard leads such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S make excellent teammates for it. Glimmora's Toxic Spikes support annoys walls such as Arghonaut and Ting-Lu, while Deoxys-S has an offensive presence with Psycho Boost. In return, Stratagem is able to offensively pressure hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Mollux, although it cannot prevent Equilibra from removing hazards. Deoxys-S can use a Life Orb and pair excellently with Stratagem by cleaning teams after it wallbreaks. Stratagem cannot easily beat special walls such as Equilibra, Heatran, and Galarian Slowking, so Pokemon that can easily defeat these threats such as Great Tusk, Ogerpon-W, and Miasmaw make excellent teammates. Chuggalong can switch into priority for Stratagem, having an especially great matchup against Rillaboom. Iron Moth can also fill a similar role as Chuggalong for Stratagem, but while it lacks the ability to deal with priority, it applies more immediate pressure. Both Chuggalong and Iron Moth appreciate Stratagem's ability to switch into Ground-type moves for them and weaken their checks such as Equilibra, Arghonaut, and Ting-Lu. Stratagem can forgo Power Herb and hold a Life Orb instead to be a powerful wallbreaker, notably 2HKOing Arghonaut with Energy Ball without needing Tera Grass. However, Life Orb chip damage makes revenge killing Stratagem easier. Stealth Rock can be run on such a set to give Stratagem some utility, and it often can place entry hazards with the switches it forces. However, Stratagem can struggle to wallbreak without a setup move. Calm Mind is also an option to let Stratagem quickly end games when given a setup opportunity, but Calm Mind is harder to set up with than Meteor Beam due to Stratagem's frailty. Earth Power can be used to OHKO Glimmora and Heatran at the cost of either valuable coverage or a setup move, weakening its ability to wallbreak past a large amount of the metagame. Specially Defensive Foes: Stratagem struggles to beat special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Cresceidon, Ting-Lu, and Equilibra. The former two can cripple it with Thunder Wave, Ting-Lu is able to remove the +1 boost with Whirlwind, and Equilibra can OHKO Stratagem with Flash Cannon. Stratagem is similarly threatened by Equilibra's Doom Desire sets, but it can often put the opponent in an awkward position due to the time it takes to land. Arghonaut: Arghonaut is able to easily tank an Energy Ball from Stratagem and deal a large amount of damage with Circle Throw. If Arghonaut burns Tera, it can freely set Spikes on Stratagem. Priority: Due to Stratagem's frailty, threats such as Hemogoblin, Kingambit, Rillaboom, and Revenankh can easily revenge kill it with Extreme Speed, Sucker Punch, Grassy Glide, and Drain Punch, respectively. However, Hemogoblin has to be wary of Tera Fire. Faster Pokemon: Although Stratagem outspeeds the vast majority of the metagame, faster threats such as Dragapult, Zamazenta, and Deoxys-S greatly threaten it due to its frailty. Booster Energy threats such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon can pose similar problems. Defensive Terastallization: As Stratagem cannot take a hit due to its pitiful bulk, Pokemon that Terastallize to resist Stratagem's attacks can beat it, such as Great Tusk using Tera Steel to survive Energy Ball and Gholdengo using Tera Water to take Fire Blast and then OHKO with Close Combat and Make it Rain, respectively."

  "Stunky": {
    "name": "Stunky",
    "text": "Stunky is a potent offensive Pokemon that compresses a strong STAB Knock Off, STAB priority in Sucker Punch, and a grounded Poison-type into a single team slot. Temper Flare allows Stunky to hit Steel-types like Pawniard, Tinkatink, and defensive Tera users like Mienfoo for super effective damage, and its secondary effect synergizes well with Gunk Shot and Sucker Punch, lessening the need for prediction. Substitute is an alternative option that allows Stunky to block status from Foongus or Snubbull and scout defensive Terastallizations from Snubbull and Mienfoo. Maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature are invaluable for allowing Stunky to outpace metagame staples like Mienfoo and non-Choice Scarf Snivy, as well as Speed tying with Gastly. Tera Dark gives Stunky a stronger Sucker Punch on teams in need of speed control, while Tera Poison provides more defensive utility against foes like Mienfoo and boosts Stunky's strongest move, Gunk Shot. Stunky's role as a grounded Poison-type means it goes well with teams that use Snubbull as a Fighting resistance or a non-Glimmet Stealth Rock setter. Stunky also has offensive synergy with Vullaby, as the pair of strong STAB Knock Off users can heavily pressure defensive cores. Stunky cannot reliably break through Mudbray, so it appreciates teammates like Eviolite Gastly and Snivy that can switch into it and threaten it."

  "Sudowoodo": {
    "name": "Sudowoodo",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Despite its thoroughly underwhelming stats, Sudowoodo leverages two rock-solid abilities and a surprisingly wide movepool to be a cheap last Pokemon on a draft that can use its utility. Its distinguishing assets compared to other bottom-tier Pokemon are its access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes, Sturdy, and Rock Head alongside multiple powerful recoil attacks for potentially unexpected offensive sets. Unfortunately, its terrible Speed, minimal special bulk, and middle-of-the-road Attack leave Sudowoodo only pseudo-useful on most teams, even at such a low cost. Entry Hazard Lead: Sturdy allows Sudowoodo to usually guarantee a turn, allowing it to set either Stealth Rock or Spikes while keeping a free item slot for added utility. Its low Speed means that it usually only has the chance to set a single entry hazard, so it's typically best to pick one and use the remaining moveslots for utility options or attacks to counter the opponent's likely lead Pokemon and entry hazard removers. Sturdy Revenge Killer: Heavy-Duty Boots alongside Sturdy gives Sudowoodo a one-time opportunity to survive a single attack and retaliate. Due to their relative inaccuracy, Sudowoodo's STAB attacks should not be the primary option on these sets; instead, it should look at options like Counter, Endeavor, and coverage attacks to tailor its counterattack to the setup foes it needs to revenge kill. Sucker Punch can help get the jump on Dark-weak offensive foes or ones already weakened by Endeavor. Primary STAB Moves: Head Smash, Stone Edge, Rock Slide Setup Moves: Iron Defense, Curse, Rock Polish Utility Moves: Stealth Rock, Spikes, Endeavor, Counter, Taunt, Brick Break Coverage: Wood Hammer, Earthquake, Drain Punch, Body Press, Low Kick, Fire Punch, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, Sucker Punch, Foul Play, Double-Edge Rock Blast: Rock Blast can knock out opposing Rock-weak Focus Sash leads like Ribombee, though due to Sudowoodo's low Speed, they'll still get a turn to act first. Endure: Endure is a valid option on Custap Berry + Sturdy sets to help guarantee the Berry activation if chip damage breaks Sturdy. Custap Berry: On lead sets, Custap Berry gives Sudowoodo an extra turn to use Endeavor to weaken the foe or throw off a powerful attack. Recoil attacks like Wood Hammer and Double-Edge work well here because the recoil knocks Sudowoodo out before the foe can move, potentially blocking an entry hazard removal attempt. Head Smash should be avoided for this particular use, since the imperfect accuracy can lead to a wasted Berry. Heavy-Duty Boots: Heavy-Duty Boots + Sturdy is the tried and true \"survive a single attack from a setup Pokemon and retaliate\" combo that can allow Sudowoodo to trade KOs with a more powerful Pokemon. Counter for physical Pokemon or Endeavor + Sucker Punch are usually the tools of choice here. Mental Herb: Mental Herb is a good alternative to Custap Berry on lead sets when an opposing Taunt lead is expected and Sudowoodo needs to secure a layer of entry hazards. Choice Band: While its low Speed and poor bulk keep Sudowoodo from being a true offensive threat, Choice Band pairs well with Rock Head and its powerful recoil moves like Head Smash and Wood Hammer to surprise an opponent expecting a traditional entry hazard set. Red Card: While it requires keeping away entry hazards, Red Card also works with Sturdy to let Sudowoodo survive a hit from a powerful setup Pokemon and force it out. This can be preferable to the traditional Heavy-Duty Boots option when the opponent has low entry hazard pressure and Sudowoodo doesn't have a reliable option to deal with the relevant setup Pokemon. As a bottom-tier Pokemon, Sudowoodo generally shouldn't be picked as a Tera Captain unless there are no other options. If this imitation tree finds itself with the unexpected honor of being a Tera Captain, it can turn into the Grass-type it always pretended to be for a more powerful Wood Hammer and useful resistances to Water, Grass, and Ground or stay petrified with Tera Rock for a frighteningly strong Head Smash. Lead Sudowoodo may prefer Tera Ghost to prevent foes from removing its hard-earned entry hazards with Rapid Spin. As a minimal-cost Pokemon, Sudowoodo won't be a primary piece of any draft and should instead be used to fill the last slot on a team that needs its particular abilities as an entry hazard lead and Sturdy insurance. Since Sudowoodo adds little defensive value to a team, it's best served on drafts that already have their main defensive priorities covered. Special Attackers: Sudowoodo has terrible special bulk, rendering it weak to almost any special attacker that it for neutral damage or better, such as Raging Bolt and Greninja. Special setup sweepers like Gholdengo and Calm Mind Iron Valiant have an easier time avoiding its revenge killer set, as they do not need to fear options like Counter and Foul Play and just need to be able to survive a hit from its mediocre unboosted Attack stat. Priority: Sudowoodo heavily relies on Custap Berry to move for more than one turn, so priority users like Rillaboom, Azumarill, and Scizor can move before it and finish Sudowoodo off before it can act. Chip Damage and Multi-hit moves: Chip damage from options like Rapid Spin and burn can break Sturdy and leave Sudowoodo open to being knocked out without putting it in range of Custap Berry. Multi-hit moves like Bullet Seed and Surging Strikes can be an efficient way to knock Sudowoodo out in a single turn, potentially stopping it from acting at all."

  "Swalot": {
    "name": "Swalot",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 7 onwards Price Range: 2-3 points Overview: Swalot is not a great Pokemon, but it plays an important role in patching up important weaknesses and providing valuable utility while also checking many of the best offensive Pokemon in the metagame. Its bulk allows it to be a reliable check to many Fairy- and Fighting-types; it can't have its item removed thanks to Sticky Hold; and it absorbs and sets its own Toxic Spikes, which strongly benefit its teammates. Although it has good coverage, Swalot struggles to deal damage due to its weak offensive stats and low Speed. It also struggles with longevity, relying on Pain Split or Rest to stay healthy. At its price, it is a solid utility Pokemon that should not come to every game, but as a late pick, it can provide great occasional value. Bulky Utility: Swalot is typically brought to check a specific foe while also providing valuable utility. It can disrupt annoying setup sweepers with Yawn, Clear Smog, and Encore; weaken other foes with Toxic Spikes and Knock Off; and deal some damage with its coverage options. Setup: Swalot has multiple setup options that it can use in niche scenarios, including Acid Armor and Swords Dance, that allow it to break through and trade KOs with foes more effectively. It typically won't be able to sweep due to its low Speed, but Swalot can catch foes off guard and break through them to enable a late-game sweep from its teammates. Primary STAB Moves: Gunk Shot, Poison Jab, Sludge Bomb, Sludge Wave Setup Moves: Swords Dance, Acid Armor, Curse Utility Moves: Toxic Spikes, Toxic, Thunder Wave, Knock Off, Encore, Yawn, Pain Split, Rest, Sleep Talk, Clear Smog, Brick Break Coverage: Earthquake, Ice Punch, Ice Beam, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, Zen Headbutt, Giga Drain, Seed Bomb, Body Press, Shadow Ball Acid Spray: Acid Spray can help Swalot break through specially defensive walls more effectively and potentially force them to switch out. Endure: Endure can be used alongside Custap Berry to guarantee getting a move off, typically Destiny Bond or Toxic Spikes. It can also be used with Rocky Helmet to chip down foes more before sacrificing Swalot. Destiny Bond: Although Swalot is typically too slow to utilize Destiny Bond, it can force foes to make tricky plays if used last, and it can also be used with Custap Berry to catch a foe off guard. Mud Shot: Although most foes outspeed Swalot even after using Mud Shot, it can allow its teammates to outspeed Speed-boosting foes and revenge killers. Black Sludge / Leftovers: Black Sludge and Leftovers give Swalot a form of longevity outside of Pain Split. Although it typically does not matter which item is used, Black Sludge is ideal if Swalot has an ability other than Sticky Hold, since foes will be punished from using Trick or Switcheroo, while Leftovers is preferred if it is expected to Terastallize. Heavy-Duty Boots: In matches where Swalot is expected to enter the field frequently, Heavy-Duty Boots is an ideal item to prevent it from taking unnecessary entry hazard damage. Rocky Helmet: Swalot is very bulky, making it an effective counter to physically defensive Pokemon with Rocky Helmet. It notably resists U-turn and takes little damage from Flip Turn, making it a great way to punish pivoting. Sitrus / Iapapa Berry: Sitrus Berry helps Swalot survive 2HKOs from specific Pokemon. Alternatively, Iapapa Berry can be used with Gluttony to heal off more damage. Resistance Berries: Resistance Berries can act as a one-time check to some foes, especially if Swalot can deal large damage back or provide necessary utility in return. Custap Berry: Since Swalot is slow, Custap Berry can be used to catch foes off guard with a fast attack or Destiny Bond. It can also be activated at higher health on Gluttony sets. Red Card: Since Swalot is very bulky, it can hold a Red Card to effectively phaze wallbreakers and setup sweepers. Swalot can benefit as a cheap Tera Captain to further boost its defensive capabilities. It is best paired with a higher-priced Tera Captain, and it is typically only used in the rare occasion that a specific defensive typing is needed more than its own. It can choose key defensive Tera types like Tera Water, Fairy, and Steel to better check foes that its teammates would typically struggle against. It can also use Tera Fighting with Body Press, but that gives it a much worse defensive typing. Swalot is a good Pokemon to add onto a team that has a notable Fairy- or Fighting-type weakness. It provides great value in its ability to check some of the best Pokemon in the format, including Iron Valiant, Sneasler, and Meowscarada. It also plays a key role as a Toxic Spikes absorber. It should typically be drafted late if a cheap Poison-type is necessary. Fast Pivots: Swalot's Toxic Spikes support is most valuable when foes are forced to switch out, making it pair well with pivots that force switches like Ogerpon-W and Urshifu-R. Dark-types like Meowscarada and Greninja are especially notable, since Swalot can switch into and resist their key weaknesses. Wincons: Swalot provides utility such as Toxic Spikes and Thunder Wave that can help enable its teammates for a late-game sweep. Notable teammates include Palafin, Tornadus-T, and Iron Valiant. Ghost-types: Ghost-types can act as a spinblocker in matchups where the opponent does not have a grounded Poison-type. They can also help break Psychic-types that can beat Swalot and potentially other teammates. Gholdengo is especially notable, since it can block Defog as well, but other Ghost-types like Annihilape and Skeledirge also work. Substitute: Since Swalot is very slow and often needs specific coverage to break Pokemon, it is easy for opponents to set a Substitute on it when super effective attacks are anticipated or if its Poison-type attacks deal less than 25% HP. Bulky Pokemon: Swalot has very average offensive stats, making it struggle with breaking through bulky Pokemon, especially if they have recovery or are immune to poison. Good examples of this include Clodsire, Archaludon, and Cresselia. Steel-types: Steel-types are immune to Swalot's Poison-type attacks and require specific coverage for it to hit them, which will typically not do much damage regardless due to its low Attack. Effective Steel-type counters include Gholdengo, Iron Treads, and Tinkaton. Poison-types: While they typically cannot deal much damage in return, Poison-types resist Swalot's attacks effectively and can absorb its Toxic Spikes. Swalot typically becomes much less valuable when facing a grounded Poison-type such as Overqwil, Muk, and Glimmora."

  "Swampert": {
    "name": "Swampert",
    "text": "Swampert is an excellent wall. Its great defensive typing gives it resistances and immunities to Fire-, Poison-, and Electric-type attacks from the likes of Infernape, Alolan Muk, and Iron Thorns, and it threatens them with Earthquake. While there is some competition for the Water-type slot on teams, Swampert is unique in its ability to simultaneously threaten Electric-types and pivot out with Flip Turn, often slowly enough to bring its teammate in completely safely. On top of this, Swampert also has access to Knock Off, which is valuable utility to cripple item-reliant Pokemon like Talonflame, Avalugg, and Registeel, and Roar, which allows Swampert to challenge setup sweepers like Cresselia and Oricorio-E. However, its limited recovery options make Swampert vulnerable to being worn down over the course of a battle, meaning it won't be able to check these aforementioned setup sweepers long-term. Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks also hampers it, as it struggles against common Grass-types like Tsareena, Breloom, and Brambleghast. On top of this, many Pokemon like Chandelure, Gallade, and Iron Thorns carry some way to surprise Swampert with Grass-type coverage, whether that be Energy Ball, Leaf Blade, or Tera Blast Grass. Flip Turn allows Swampert to pivot out and bring in teammates to make progress. Knock Off supplies utility against foes that Swampert cannot hit well with its STAB moves, and it cripples item-reliant foes like Munkidori, Talonflame, and Avalugg. However, Roar prevents Swampert's passivity from getting taken advantage of by stopping setup sweepers like Oricorio-E and Paldean Tauros-W. The physically defensive EV spread is better into attackers like Flygon and Mienshao, but a specially defensive one assists against Electric-types like Rotom-H and Raikou. Tera Poison turns Swampert's 4x weakness to Grass-type attacks into a resistance and helps it more easily take on the myriad of Fighting-types like Mienshao, Infernape, and Breloom. Tera Fairy makes Swampert immune to Dragon-type attacks from threats like Dragalge and resistant to Dark- and Fighting-type attacks from foes such as Brute Bonnet and Mienshao while allowing it to continue checking Ground-types like Flygon. Tera Dragon gives Swampert resistances to Water-, Fire-, and Grass-type attacks, making it strong against common attackers like Basculegion-M, Incineroar, and Breloom. Tera Steel gives Swampert a wide array of resistances to more easily handle special attackers like Dragalge and Sylveon. Swampert benefits from the support of Grass-resistant teammates like Dragalge, Talonflame, and Incineroar, covering its biggest weakness. Swampert's Stealth Rock can be supplemented by Grass-resistant Spikes users like Klefki and Brambleghast to stack entry hazards, both of which also benefit from Swampert's Fire resistance. Ghost-type teammates like Brambleghast and Chandelure can also support Swampert's Stealth Rock by preventing Rapid Spin from opposing Tsareena and Avalugg. Knock Off users like Alolan Muk, Incineroar, and Mienshao can further support Swampert's entry hazards by removing items. While Swampert can take multiple hits, it lacks any reliable recovery, so pairing it with Wish passers like Sylveon and Florges or backup walls like Dragalge, Vileplume, Registeel, and Incineroar can be helpful. As Swampert lures in Grass-types like Tsareena and Vileplume, wallbreakers that can take advantage of Swampert's pivoting like Infernape, Dragalge, and Chandelure can threaten these foes and force others to switch in and take damage from Swampert's Stealth Rock. More offensive sets like Choice Band or bulkier ones that utilize Assault Vest can work, but it's difficult to fit another entry hazard setter that doesn't add on to Swampert's Grass-type weakness. Swampert can run special attacks like Hydro Pump, Earth Power, and Ice Beam; however, if Swampert goes this route, it struggles to fit these moves and its great utility options on the same set, as it wants all of Knock Off, pivoting, hazards, STAB moves, and powerful coverage. Grass-types and Grass-type coverage: Foes like Vileplume and Breloom can be immensely threatening. Grass-types with Rapid Spin like Brambleghast and Tsareena are particularly dangerous foes because they can chase Swampert out while removing Stealth Rock simultaneously. Pokemon with Grass-type coverage like Grass Knot Infernape, Energy Ball Chandelure, and Tera Blast Grass Iron Thorns can typically KO Swampert without warning from high health. Chip Damage: Swampert lacks reliable recovery, so it is vulnerable to repeated damage from entry hazards, status ailments from Vileplume's Effect Spore and Talonflame's Flame Body, and repeated attacks from foes it is meant to check like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Knock Off users like Incineroar and Alolan Muk only exacerbate this issue with their ability to remove Swampert's Leftovers."

    "name": "Sylveon",
    "text": "Sylveon's great matchup against top threats like Mienshao and Flygon alongside its set versatility makes it one of the premier Fairy-types in NU. Wallbreaking sets can break through common special walls like Alolan Muk and Umbreon. Sylveon can also run a more defensive set, letting it heal up teammates that it naturally synergizes with like Incineroar, Registeel, and Swampert that lack reliable recovery. Sylveon has great Special Defense, letting it take on special wallbreakers like Inteleon and Diancie with little or no investment. However, both of Sylveon's roles are contested by another Fairy-type, namely Florges, as Florges has access to Trick for Choice Specs sets as a way to decommission Steel-types and special walls, and it has higher Speed, meaning its wallbreaking sets can outpace more threats and Wish passing sets can invest more in its Defense. On top of that, Sylveon must compete with other Wish passers such as Vaporeon and Umbreon, which can provide more utility at times with the former having access to Haze and Flip Turn, whereas the latter can provide Thunder Wave and Toxic. Sylveon is also walled immensely by Steel-types like Copperajah and Klefki, but their lack of recovery leaves them susceptible to being worn down over the course of a game. Wish sets also tend to be passive and easily taken advantage of by the aforementioned Steel-types and setup sweepers like Munkidori and Incineroar. Sylveon's subpar Defense can also let it be broken through, as it's typically forced to take Knock Off for its team all while being whittled away at by entry hazards. Psychic allows Sylveon to hit Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Toxtricity super effectively. However, Psyshock can be run to hit Tentacruel and both Tera Poison Cresselia and Bronzong harder. Shadow Ball gives Sylveon a strong neutral move for the Steel-types that tend to switch into Sylveon like Klefki, Registeel, and Copperajah, and notably, it hits Bronzong super effectively. As Sylveon's last moveslot is its most flexible one, it prefers to run Draining Kiss as a secondary STAB move so that it doesn't get chipped away at as easily. Tera Blast Ground can instead be used to hit the aforementioned non-Bronzong Steel-types that could sit on Sylveon otherwise; however, due to this requiring Terastallization, it typically isn't run. A Modest nature is preferred for the extra damage output, but Timid can be run to outspeed Adamant Incineroar. Tera Fairy allows Sylveon to reach catastrophic levels of damage with its Hyper Voice, as it's now able to 2HKO Fairy-resistant Pokemon like Rotom-H and Vileplume. Sylveon's main roadblock from tearing apart teams is bulky Steel-types like Registeel, Copperajah, and Klefki; however, due to their lack of recovery, there are a few ways its teammates can whittle them down. Entry hazard setters like Brambleghast, Swampert, and Flygon can help to soften up these Steel-types for Sylveon's attacks. Another way to break through these Pokemon is teammates that carry super effective coverage to surprise these Steel-types like Close Combat Staraptor, Focus Blast or Tera Blast Ground Munkidori, and Focus Blast Dragalge. It can also go through more straightforward means such as having a partner like Mienshao, Incineroar, or Flygon to pressure these Steel-types. Incineroar, Flygon, and Infernape greatly enjoy Sylveon as a partner, as they can pivot it in on physically defensive Water-types like Milotic, Swampert, and Vaporeon that wall them. Choice Scarf users like Munkidori, Meloetta, and Porygon-Z enjoy Sylveon wearing away at Steel-types like Copperajah, Klefki, and Registeel. Sylveon easily dispatches Dark-types like Incineroar, Umbreon, and Alolan Muk. Teammates that benefit from this like Meloetta, Cresselia, and Brambleghast pair well alongside Sylveon, as they can form a wallbreaking core together. Calm Mind allows Sylveon to use defensive walls like Vaporeon and Talonflame in its favor, as it can set up on them to become more threatening. On the other hand, Roar prevents Sylveon from needing to risk certain Calm Mind wars like those versus Cresselia and Bronzong, and it doubles as a way to get extra chip damage on Steel-types trying to switch in, forcing them out to rack up entry hazard damage. The Speed EVs allow Sylveon to get the jump on Umbreon and Vaporeon, letting it threaten the former better and avoid having its stat boosts thrown away by the latter's Haze before it can get a hit off. Tera Steel is preferred, as it allows Sylveon to better handle Poison- and Steel-types like Vileplume and Copperajah, provides an immunity to Umbreon's and Quagsire's Toxic, and lets it soft check many special attackers in a pinch like Munkidori, Porygon-Z, and Toxtricity. Tera Poison, on the other hand, maintains Sylveon's matchup against Fighting-types while keeping Tera Steel's utility against Toxic users and poison from Alolan Muk. Alternatively, Tera Water provides a strong defensive typing that doesn't forfeit Sylveon's matchup against both Ground- and Fighting-types like Flygon, Mienshao, and Infernape. Leftovers prevents Sylveon from having to use Wish as often and lets it heal with Protect, but Heavy-Duty Boots is useful to circumvent entry hazard chip damage. Sylveon's access to Wish means it can support Pokemon without reliable recovery like Swampert, Bronzong, and Incineroar. Pokemon like Basculegion, Munkidori, and Registeel that are scared out by Brute Bonnet, Flygon, and Mienshao enjoy having Sylveon to check these threats. Alongside a specially defensive partner like Alolan Muk, Gastrodon, or Copperajah, Sylveon can help to form a defensive backbone for teams. Sylveon also appreciates wallbreakers like Mienshao, Flygon, and Chandelure, as they can pressure Steel-types that typically wall and take advantage of it like Klefki, Copperajah, and Bronzong. Due to Sylveon's reliance on Protect to safely heal, it's vulnerable to setup sweepers like Drednaw, Munkidori, and Gallade, meaning Choice Scarf revenge killers like Ditto and Mienshao or Pokemon with priority like Flygon pair well with it. Sylveon also tends to be a momentum sink, so pivots like Flygon, Incineroar, and Mienshao that do well versus common switch-ins like Alolan Muk, Registeel, and Copperajah can help regain lost momentum. As Sylveon can be easily chipped down by entry hazards and having to switch into Knock Off and U-turn from Pokemon like Mienshao, a second soft check to physical attackers is welcome, so partners like Talonflame, Vileplume, and Dragalge work well to fulfill this role. Due to Choice Specs Sylveon already having all the coverage it needs from its first three slots, it can run many moves for its last. Sylveon can opt for Quick Attack as a means to pick off weakened threats. Hyper Beam can be used as a nuke button that's able to chip away at Steel-types heavily but leaves it open the next turn. Sylveon can even forgo Choice Specs entirely and go for a Pixie Plate set that allows it to bluff Choice Specs, surprising its opponent when it changes up its moves; however, Sylveon's overall power drops. On Wish sets, Moonblast + Cute Charm can be run on bulkier teams, as Moonblast has higher PP than Hyper Voice, and if Sylveon is female, it can fish for immobilization via attraction against Pokemon forced to be male like Hitmonlee and Tornadus. Steel-types: Registeel, Bronzong, and Copperajah all wall Sylveon and can use it to set entry hazards, as they easily threaten it out with their Steel-type STAB moves. While Klefki can also wall Sylveon, use it to set entry hazards, and paralyze it with Thunder Wave, it's more of a stalemate because Klefki fails to do significant damage to Sylveon unless it carries a rare move like Steel Beam. All of these Steel-types must be wary of Tera Blast Ground and, in Bronzong's case, Shadow Ball. Poison-types: Alolan Muk, Munkidori, Vileplume, and Tentacruel can take a Hyper Voice and threaten back with super effective Poison-type attacks. Dragalge can also take a hit and threaten it, but it can only do this once per game. Chip Damage: Sylveon, especially when defensive, tends to have to take Knock Off and U-turn for its team, and losing Heavy-Duty Boots or not running it in the first place means entry hazards also chip away at it. All of this combined with Wish taking two turns and possibly being cancelled out due to Roar from Swampert or Whirlwind from Copperajah means that Sylveon can be whittled away at and beaten by wallbreakers it normally beats, like Mienshao and Flygon."

    "text": "Tatsugiri is a Nasty Plot sweeper that compresses offensive utility in its access to both Rapid Spin and Storm Drain. The former is not only a valid option for entry hazard removal but also one way that Tatsugiri may clean late-game when setting up on more passive foes like Bronzong and Coalossal. That being said, Tatsugiri is very frail, which limits its potential to set up both Nasty Plot and Rapid Spin, making it easier to revenge kill with priority and diminishes the impact of Storm Drain when Water-types like Paldean Taurus-W and Bruxish can OHKO it with their stronger coverage. Eject Pack is ran over Heavy-Duty Boots on some offensive VoltTurn teams, as the sacrifice to Tatsugiri's bulk and consistency in removing entry hazards could be worth it to preserve momentum and bring in a wallbreaker after using Draco Meteor. A Timid nature ensures Tatsugiri may revenge kill Adamant Skuntank and Bombirdier, but on teams where its revenge killing purposes are not as necessary, Tatsugiri may opt for a Modest nature, which enjoys some extra liberties like 2HKOing Decidueye with Draco Meteor. Tatsugiri's Tera typings are defensive, as they offer the strongest sweeping chances by limiting its revenge killers; Tera Fairy is generally the best, allowing Tatsugiri to wall opposing Tatsugiri and Paldean Tauros-W and resist Sucker Punch. Tera Ghost is another option to wall Paldean Tauros-W, and it also allows Tatsugiri to reliably revenge kill—or prevent the revenge kill from—Curse Arcanine. Lastly, Tera Normal is a niche option to avoid relevant Ghost-type attacks like Decidueye's Shadow Sneak and Choice Scarf Hoopa's Shadow Ball, with the minor benefit of buffing Rapid Spin. Tatsugiri may easily fit on a variety of teams due to its offensive utility, with a predilection for offensive structures, but it ultimately always needs careful positioning for it to get on the field due to its frailty. It will best offensively check entry hazard users like Mudsdale, Gligar, and Coalossal, so pivots like Staraptor, Scyther, and Kilowattrel are great at getting Tatsugiri in safely against these walls. Arcanine and Skuntank may lure these walls in as well, making for riskier albeit just as rewarding, positioning plays for Tatsugiri to double switch or simply come in on their Stealth Rock and Spikes. In return, these two offensive teammates put pressure on some of the specially defensive walls that Tatsugiri struggles with, like Florges and Copperajah. Fire- and Ground-types such as Paldean Tauros-F and Golurk will enjoy Tatsugiri's ability to deter Water-type attacks from walls and revenge killers alike, such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-W; use these matchups as setup opportunities for Tatsugiri. Defensive cores with walls such as Mudsdale, Galarian Slowbro, and Copperajah are good to rely on when Tatsugiri is forced out by faster revenge killers like Staraptor and Choice Scarf Florges. With Eject Pack, Tatsugiri will have a one-time switch on special walls like Copperajah and Gastrodon, so physical wallbreakers that enjoy the free switch-in like Flame Orb Heracross and Choice Band Paldean Tauros-F will make the most out of this interaction."

    "text": "Paldean Tauros-W splashes its way to the top of the tier as one of the best wallbreakers thanks to its strong STAB attacks boosted with Choice Band or Bulk Up, good Speed tier, and great matchup against top threats like Flygon and Incineroar. With a Choice Band, it threatens common physical walls like Swampert, Galarian Slowbro, and Bellibolt. Alternatively, it can choose to set up with Bulk Up, which prevents physical revenge killers from trying to stop it. Not only does it have a good Speed tier, outspeeding wallbreakers like Porygon-Z, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Toxicroak, but it has a strong priority option in Aqua Jet to beat weakened, faster foes like Kilowattrel and Cinccino. However, it can be easy to take advantage of. If it is Choice Band, then Pokemon immune to Water like Vaporeon or Toxicroak as well as Ghost-types like Chandelure can switch in and punish it. Other foes that resist its STAB moves like Galarian Slowbro and Vileplume use Rocky Helmet to punish its use of contact moves; the latter can punish it further due to Effect Spore. Vileplume is able to hard wall Bulk Up variants, stopping any attempt to set up or forcing the use of Tera. Its Speed tier is good, but not good enough, as some wallbreakers like Kilowattrel, Tornadus, and Munkidori outspeed and revenge it with ease. Choice Band turns Paldean Tauros-W into a powerful wallbreaker with its high-Base Power STAB attacks, letting it 2HKO slower Water- or Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Brambleghast and Choice Specs Sylveon. Choice Band also takes advantage of Aqua Jet's priority to revenge kill faster threats like Kilowattrel, Munkidori, and Choice Scarf Chandelure. Choice Scarf allows it to use Raging Bull instead of Aqua Jet, giving it another Water-type STAB move that doesn't have recoil damage. Zen Headbutt allows it to 2HKO Vileplume, while Earthquake is more accurate and has higher damage against other Poison-types like Galarian Slowbro and Dragalge. Choice Scarf enables Paldean Tauros-W to turn into a revenge killer, outspeeding and KOing threats like Inteleon, Munkidori, and Kilowattrel. Tera Water pushes Wave Crash's damage through the roof, opening room for new 2HKOs on Pokemon like Cresselia, defensive Brambleghast, and Bellibolt. Tera Fighting buffs Close Combat, enabling it to OHKO Klefki and, after some prior chip damage, Diancie and Vaporeon. Psychic- and Fairy-types like Cresselia, Munkidori, and Sylveon all heavily threaten Paldean Tauros-W with their super effective STAB attacks while being able to tank its Close Combat. This opens room for Steel-types and certain special walls like Bronzong, Registeel, and Incineroar; in return, Paldean Tauros-W helps deal with Fire- and Ground-types, like Chandelure, Flygon, and Swampert, that hinder those Pokemon. Ground-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon take advantage of Electric-types like Kilowattrel, Bellibolt, and Rotom-C, which can all KO Paldean Tauros-W with ease. Due to its struggles with taking on common physical walls like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Tera Poison Avalugg, special wallbreakers like Munkidori, Porygon-Z, and Hisuian Typhlosion make for great partners. Due to recoil damage, Rocky Helmet, and entry hazards, it appreciates Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Florges as well as Lunar Dance from Choice Scarf Cresselia. Vaporeon and Toxicroak are both checks to it due to their Water immunity; this opens up room for certain Pokemon like Rotom-C and Kilowattrel. Galarian Articuno in particular forms a core with it thanks to Future Sight and U-turn to pressure Vileplume and other Pokemon that switch into Paldean Tauros-W; in return, Paldean Tauros-W helps defeat any Steel- and Dark-types that Galarian Articuno loses to. Raging Bull can be used over Wave Crash as a strong option if Paldean Tauros-W is not using Leftovers to help mitigate recoil damage. Aqua Jet gives it a form of strong priority, making revenge killing it with Kilowattrel and Munkidori much harder. Zen Headbutt helps to hit Poison-types like Vileplume, Toxicroak, and Dragalge. Substitute can be used instead for longevity, pairing well with Tera Steel to become immune to status and Vileplume's Leech Seed. Leftovers gives it some form of longevity while setting up and lets it regain some HP lost due to Wave Crash's recoil. Lum Berry grants it a one-time immunity to any status it may obtain from the likes of Talonflame's Flame Body and Vileplume's Effect Spore. Tera Steel grants useful resistances to Fairy-, Psychic-, Flying-, and Grass-type attacks that Paldean Tauros-W is otherwise weak to, while Tera Water boosts the damage of Wave Crash and Raging Bull, though it doesn't offer much defensive utility. This set excels when partnered with other setup sweepers on a hyper offense team, such as Flygon, Chandelure, and Incineroar; they all appreciate having Galvantula as a lead to lay Sticky Web on the opposing side, slowing down any faster Pokemon. Froslass, Brambleghast, and Iron Thorns are other good leads for these teams, using Spikes to wear down already unstable checks. Despite that, Paldean Tauros-W isn't a one-trick pony, being a staple on some balance builds, especially when paired with Flygon. It helps beat some of Flygon's checks such as Bronzong, Orthworm, and Choice Scarf Cresselia; simultaneously, Flygon pressures Paldean Tauros-W's checks like Galarian Slowbro, Toxicroak, and Vileplume. It appreciates Steel-types like Bronzong, Registeel, and Klefki to tank any Psychic- and Fairy-type attacks coming its way. Flygon, Swampert, and Volt Absorb Kilowattrel do a great job at punishing any Electric-types trying to revenge it like opposing Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Rotom-C. It appreciates help from Pokemon like Munkidori and Meloetta to threaten Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone; Paldean Tauros-W, in return, alleviates pressure from Dark-types like Incineroar, Alolan Muk, and Umbreon. Iron Head can be used as an option to hit Tera Fairy Vaporeon, but that's its only target because Wave Crash hits the other Fairy-types for more damage. Stone Edge is an option to target Talonflame without risking a Flame Body burn. Trailblaze can be paired with Bulk Up to outspeed would-be faster Pokemon like Kilowattrel and Choice Scarf Porygon-Z. Grass-types: Vileplume is a hard counter, resisting both of its STAB attacks and only ever getting 2HKOed by Choice Band Zen Headbutt. Defensive Brambleghast can be problematic due to its immunity to Fighting-type moves and Water resistance; that in combination with Strength Sap can wall Paldean Tauros-W. Choice Scarf users like Rotom-C and Tsareena can revenge kill it while resisting its Water-type moves. Decidueye resists Wave Crash and is immune to Close Combat, letting it switch in and set up at no cost. Psychic-types: Bulky Psychic-types like Cresselia and Galarian Slowbro can tank any of Paldean Tauros-W's hits and threaten it in return. Others like Munkidori and Espeon outspeed it and threaten to KO or force the use of Tera Steel. Water-immune and -resistant Pokemon: Vaporeon and Gastrodon are both immune to Wave Crash and Raging Bull and can use Tera Fairy to resist Close Combat. Vaporeon and Milotic can use Scald to burn it. Toxicroak is immune to its Water-type moves and resists Close Combat, often giving it a free turn to set up. Tera Water Galarian Slowbro is hardly threatened by Paldean Tauros-W, and it can hit it back with a super effective Psychic. Chip Damage: Some of Paldean Tauros-W's most common checks, like Vileplume, Galarian Slowbro, and Houndstone, tend to use Rocky Helmet, punishing it for simply attacking. On top of that, one of its main STAB attacks inflicts recoil damage, which adds up over any given match. This also leads into it having a poor matchup against Talonflame, Vileplume, and Bellibolt, which all have abilities that can status it on contact."

Stone Edge is great coverage for common Fighting-resistant foes like Haunter, Scyther, and Drifblim, while Tera Electric lets Paldean Tauros hit the aforementioned Flying-types and Vaporeon with Tera Blast and offers an immunity to paralysis. Tera Rock Stone Edge and Tera Electric Tera Blast both allow Paldean Tauros to OHKO Drifblim. Leftovers aids its general longevity, while Lum Berry allows it to set up safely once against status users like Rotom and Drifblim. Offensive Pokemon like Choice Scarf Rotom and Zoroark appreciate Paldean Tauros forcing out foes like Umbreon and Chansey; in return, they can check Ghost-types like opposing Rotom and Drifblim. Defensive teammates like Vaporeon and Chansey can sponge special attacks and either help its longevity with Wish or its offensive capabilities with Thunder Wave."

    "text": "Choice Specs Terapagos leverages its incredibly powerful Normal-type STAB option in Tera Starstorm, a good Special Attack stat, and a plethora of coverage moves to become a fearsome wallbreaker on Normal teams. Tera Starstorm seriously damages neutral targets, OHKOing Galarian Weezing and 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex and bulky Gouging Fire variants. Ice Beam wrecks Flying- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Dragonite, and Landorus-T. Earth Power hits Steel- and Rock-types like Archaludon and Garganacl, while Flamethrower hits Steel-types that don't fear Earth Power like Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight. Tera Shell allows Terapagos to greatly increase its bulk while at full health, letting it come in on strong attacks and return the favor. It also enables it to revenge kill threats like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Choice Specs Iron Valiant. Ursaluna-B is a great teammate for Terapagos, as they each break through what the other cannot. Both possess incredibly strong Normal-type STAB moves, and Ursaluna-B scares off Steel-types like Heatran and Gholdengo for Terapagos. In return, Terapagos hits the Grass- and Flying-types that Ursaluna-B struggles with, such as Rillaboom, Hydrapple, and Gliscor. Hisuian Zoroark is another great partner, as it provides a very handy Fighting immunity to take on threats like Body Press Archaludon and Choice Specs Kommo-o. In return, Terapagos can break through bulky answers to Hisuian Zoroark like Toxapex and Alolan Muk with its sheer power. Blissey provides Stealth Rock support and is a great special sponge for threatening special attacks like Flutter Mane's Moonblast. It can also use Thunder Wave to slow down opposing threats like Choice Specs Dragapult and Choice Specs Greninja for Terapagos to blast them with Tera Starstorm and Ice Beam while easing the burden of prediction for Terapagos by switching in on special threats like the aforementioned Greninja as well as Latios if Terapagos gets a prediction incorrect. Braviary can remove entry hazards for Terapagos with Defog, ensuring that Tera Shell stays active while being able to switch into and handle threats like Sneasler and Meowscarada for Terapagos. It can also bring Terapagos in safely with U-turn. Choice Scarf Indeedee helps massively in the Fighting and Poison matchups, hitting threats like Zamazenta, Iron Hands, and Clodsire hard to pave the way for Terapagos to break. Indeedee also provides Healing Wish support for Terapagos and blocks revenge killing attempts from Mach Punch Breloom and Sucker Punch Kingambit with Psychic Terrain. Ditto is an excellent reverse sweeper, surprising opponents trying to set up after forcing Terapagos out like Swords Dance Breloom and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Porygon2 can deal major damage to major threats like Gouging Fire and Scizor with Foul Play, letting Terapagos break them down with repeated assaults. It also functions as a blanket switch-in to many threatening attackers like Gholdengo if Terapagos mispredicts, making Terapagos's coverage moves much easier to click without fear of mispredicting. Cincinno is a scary physical sweeper and hazard remover with Tidy Up complemented by its colorful coverage, hitting Rock-types with Bullet Seed, Flying-types with Triple Axel and Rock Blast, and Fire-types with Rock Blast. Terapagos acts as a great form of entry hazard removal due to its ability to immediately threaten and outspeed most entry hazard setters like Gliscor, Skarmory, Forretress, and Great Tusk. Tera Starstorm removes weakened threats like Keldeo and Ogerpon-W and OHKOes Iron Valiant. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types, especially Gholdengo, which can come into Terapagos to spinblock it. Ice Beam OHKOes Landorus and Gliscor after Stealth Rock damage, allowing Terapagos to exert pressure against Flying teams. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Terapagos retain its ability in spite of entry hazards, letting it be a one-time check to threats like Hisuian Lilligant, Ursaluna-B, and Zamazenta. A Modest nature is preferred to hit as hard as possible, as it already outspeeds most relevant entry hazard setters without a Speed-boosting nature. It's vital for Terapagos to have teammates that can that can wall strong attackers, meaning Terapagos does not have to give up its ability to emergency check a foe using Tera Shell. Blissey and Braviary fulfill these roles, with Blissey dealing with special attackers like Raging Bolt, Latios, and Flutter Mane, and Braviary dealing with strong physical attackers like Sneasler and Kingambit. Blissey also provides Stealth Rock and Healing Wish to support Terapagos, and Braviary appreciates Terapagos taking Braviary's job of removing entry hazards, as it lets Braviary run Close Combat for the aforementioned Kingambit. Ursaluna-B loves Terapagos's ability to take down Corviknight and Gliscor and break Gholdengo's Air Balloon. In return, Ursaluna-B deals with Steel- and Ghost-types like Archaludon, Heatran, and Sableye. Additionally, Ursaluna-B has Vacuum Wave to pick off threats like Chien-Pao and Hisuian Lilligant, as Terapagos does not OHKO them. Hisuian Zoroark provides a Fighting immunity and deals with Keldeo and Archaludon. Furthermore, Hisuian Zoroark can disguse itself as Terapagos, forcing out foes that cannot break its Tera Shell and survive an attack, which brings in walls like Iron Hands and Hisuian Goodra that Hisuian Zoroark can inconvenience with Will-O-Wisp or Trick. Porygon2 is a defensive wall that can be run alongside Terapagos to further improve the Flying and Dragon matchup, and it has Foul Play to deal with Ceruledge and Choice Band Excadrill. Ditto is able to check threats like Gouging Fire and Ceruledge that Terapagos does not have coverage for. Terapagos has no shortage of moves it can run, such as Earth Power, which lets it deal with Archaludon and Ceruledge; Scorching Sands, which lets it fish for burns against Alolan Muk and Clodsire; and Dazzling Gleam for Sableye. However, Terapagos would lose the coverage needed to OHKO Gliscor or threaten Corviknight and Gholdengo, in addition to Tera Starstorm's damage being comparable with super effective coverage if the opposing Pokemon is not 4x weak to Terapagos's coverage. Even though Calm Mind is tempting to use with Rapid Spin, losing crucial coverage hampers Terapagos ability to keep entry hazards off."

It can also bring Terapagos in safely with U-turn. Choice Scarf Indeedee helps massively in the Fighting and Poison matchups, hitting threats like Zamazenta, Iron Hands, and Clodsire hard to pave the way for Terapagos to break. Indeedee also provides Healing Wish support for Terapagos and blocks revenge killing attempts from Mach Punch Breloom and Sucker Punch Kingambit with Psychic Terrain. Ditto is an excellent reverse sweeper, surprising opponents trying to set up after forcing Terapagos out like Swords Dance Breloom and Dragon Dance Dragapult. Porygon2 can deal major damage to major threats like Gouging Fire and Scizor with Foul Play, letting Terapagos break them down with repeated assaults. It also functions as a blanket switch-in to many threatening attackers like Gholdengo if Terapagos mispredicts, making Terapagos's coverage moves much easier to click without fear of mispredicting. Cincinno is a scary physical sweeper and hazard remover with Tidy Up complemented by its colorful coverage, hitting Rock-types with Bullet Seed, Flying-types with Triple Axel and Rock Blast, and Fire-types with Rock Blast. Terapagos acts as a great form of entry hazard removal due to its ability to immediately threaten and outspeed most entry hazard setters like Gliscor, Skarmory, Forretress, and Great Tusk. Tera Starstorm removes weakened threats like Keldeo and Ogerpon-W and OHKOes Iron Valiant. Flamethrower roasts Steel-types, especially Gholdengo, which can come into Terapagos to spinblock it. Ice Beam OHKOes Landorus and Gliscor after Stealth Rock damage, allowing Terapagos to exert pressure against Flying teams. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Terapagos retain its ability in spite of entry hazards, letting it be a one-time check to threats like Hisuian Lilligant, Ursaluna-B, and Zamazenta. A Modest nature is preferred to hit as hard as possible, as it already outspeeds most relevant entry hazard setters without a Speed-boosting nature. It's vital for Terapagos to have teammates that can that can wall strong attackers, meaning Terapagos does not have to give up its ability to emergency check a foe using Tera Shell. Blissey and Braviary fulfill these roles, with Blissey dealing with special attackers like Raging Bolt, Latios, and Flutter Mane, and Braviary dealing with strong physical attackers like Sneasler and Kingambit. Blissey also provides Stealth Rock and Healing Wish to support Terapagos, and Braviary appreciates Terapagos taking Braviary's job of removing entry hazards, as it lets Braviary run Close Combat for the aforementioned Kingambit. Ursaluna-B loves Terapagos's ability to take down Corviknight and Gliscor and break Gholdengo's Air Balloon. In return, Ursaluna-B deals with Steel- and Ghost-types like Archaludon, Heatran, and Sableye. Additionally, Ursaluna-B has Vacuum Wave to pick off threats like Chien-Pao and Hisuian Lilligant, as Terapagos does not OHKO them. Hisuian Zoroark provides a Fighting immunity and deals with Keldeo and Archaludon. Furthermore, Hisuian Zoroark can disguse itself as Terapagos, forcing out foes that cannot break its Tera Shell and survive an attack, which brings in walls like Iron Hands and Hisuian Goodra that Hisuian Zoroark can inconvenience with Will-O-Wisp or Trick. Porygon2 is a defensive wall that can be run alongside Terapagos to further improve the Flying and Dragon matchup, and it has Foul Play to deal with Ceruledge and Choice Band Excadrill. Ditto is able to check threats like Gouging Fire and Ceruledge that Terapagos does not have coverage for. Terapagos has no shortage of moves it can run, such as Earth Power, which lets it deal with Archaludon and Ceruledge; Scorching Sands, which lets it fish for burns against Alolan Muk and Clodsire; and Dazzling Gleam for Sableye. However, Terapagos would lose the coverage needed to OHKO Gliscor or threaten Corviknight and Gholdengo, in addition to Tera Starstorm's damage being comparable with super effective coverage if the opposing Pokemon is not 4x weak to Terapagos's coverage. Even though Calm Mind is tempting to use with Rapid Spin, losing crucial coverage hampers Terapagos ability to keep entry hazards off."

    "text": "Choice Specs Terapagos leverages its incredibly powerful Normal-type STAB option in Tera Starstorm, a good Special Attack stat, and a plethora of coverage moves to become a fearsome wallbreaker on Normal teams. Tera Starstorm seriously damages neutral targets, OHKOing Galarian Weezing and 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex and bulky Gouging Fire variants. Ice Beam wrecks Flying- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Dragonite, and Landorus-T. Earth Power hits Steel- and Rock-types like Archaludon and Garganacl, while Flamethrower hits Steel-types that don't fear Earth Power like Air Balloon Gholdengo and Corviknight. Tera Shell allows Terapagos to greatly increase its bulk while at full health, letting it come in on strong attacks and return the favor. It also enables it to revenge kill threats like Choice Scarf Urshifu-R and Choice Specs Iron Valiant. Ursaluna-B is a great teammate for Terapagos, as they each break through what the other cannot. Both possess incredibly strong Normal-type STAB moves, and Ursaluna-B scares off Steel-types like Heatran and Gholdengo for Terapagos. In return, Terapagos hits the Grass- and Flying-types that Ursaluna-B struggles with, such as Rillaboom, Hydrapple, and Gliscor. Hisuian Zoroark is another great partner, as it provides a very handy Fighting immunity to take on threats like Body Press Archaludon and Choice Specs Kommo-o.

  "Terrakion": {
    "name": "Terrakion",
    "text": "Thanks to its high Attack stat and almost unresisted STAB combination, Choice Band Terrakion makes for an excellent wallbreaker that is very difficult to switch into. Earthquake helps it deal with Poison-types such as Fezandipiti and Revavroom. Quick Attack gives it a form of priority to deal with faster, weakened Pokemon like Cyclizar and Noivern. Justified allows Terrakion to switch into Dark-type attacks and punish moves like Knock Off from Cyclizar to boost its Attack. Tera Blast paired with Tera Ghost gives Terrakion a Ghost-type move that threatens a 2HKO on bulky Psychic-types like Slowbro and Reuniclus. Tera Rock boosts Terrakion's Stone Edge even further, making it very difficult to switch into and guaranteeing a 2HKO on Slowbro. Tera Rock helps Terrakion defensively by removing its weaknesses to Fairy and Psychic and giving it a resistance to Flying-type attacks, making it much better into revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Talonflame. Tera Ghost also removes its weaknesses to Fairy and Psychic, but it also removes its weaknesses to Fighting and Ground, which gives Terrakion an opportunity to take out common Choice Scarf users such as Mienshao, Galarian Zapdos, and Krookodile. Tera Ghost pairs well with Justified, deterring opposing Pokemon from hitting it with super effective Dark-type attacks in fear of boosting its Attack. Choice Band Terrakion can fit on a plethora of balance and bulky offense teams thanks to its great Speed tier and its excellent power as a wallbreaker. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Chesnaught, Empoleon, and Krookodile can help it pick up 2HKOs on bulky physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro and rack up residual damage on revenge killers like Choice Scarf Gengar and Krookodile switching in. Terrakion appreciates pivot support to get it in safely; therefore, Pokemon like Cyclizar, Fezandipiti, and Thundurus can keep up momentum by pivoting on defensive switch-ins like Empoleon and Krookodile and create opportunities for Terrakion to attack. Terrakion appreciates Future Sight support from Pokemon like Slowbro and Reuniclus, as it can use Close Combat more freely while Future Sight punishes Fairy-, Flying- and particularly Poison-types that switch in like Fezandipiti, Noivern, and Galarian Weezing. Lots of common Choice Scarf users such as Gardevoir, Galarian Zapdos, and Mienshao can revenge kill Terrakion, making defensive partners that can switch into the aforementioned Pokemon very valuable. Physical tanks such as Hippowdon and Galarian Weezing and special walls like Empoleon can switch into the revenge killers while offering utility like entry hazards and Rocky Helmet chip damage. Terrakion weakening opposing Pokemon like Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Hisuian Goodra allows teammates like Revavroom, Choice Scarf Krookodile, and Yanmega to come in afterwards and finish the job. Swords Dance Terrakion is a powerful setup sweeper, which boasts almost immediate wallbreaking power. Earthquake acts as an excellent coverage move and allows it to deal with targets such as Jirachi and Fezandipiti easily. Substitute is an alternative that lets Terrakion safely choose whether to set up a Swords Dance or fire off a STAB move after forcing out a Pokemon like Cyclizar or Bisharp. Taunt can be used to stop entry hazards from going up, prevent setup sweepers like Blastoise and Revavroom from taking advantage of Terrakion, and take away recovery and other status moves from foes such as Hippowdon and Slowbro. Air Balloon earns Terrakion a free turn against Ground-types such as Krookodile and can be used alongside Taunt to completely shut down Hippowdon without Stone Edge. Leftovers is an alternative that allows Terrakion to take better advantage of its decent natural bulk and synergizes particularly well with Substitute. Tera Flying removes its weaknesses to Ground- and Fighting-type attacks, thus giving it opportunities to set up against as well as break checks like Hippowdon, Chesnaught, and Choice Scarf Krookodile. Swords Dance Terrakion fits best on offense structures, particularly hyper offense, due to its ability to threaten the majority of the metagame after a single Swords Dance. It shares many of its defensive checks, like Hippowdon, with other common setup sweepers such as Revavroom and Mimikyu. This means that Terrakion can often be sacrificed to deal good damage to these checks before fainting, which enables the aforementioned sweepers to capitalize on the weakened physical walls to potentially pull off a sweep. Its great Speed tier strengthens its ability to chunk holes in the opposing team by taking advantage of common Pokemon like Jirachi and Salamence, which can often free up teammates like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Weak Armor Armarouge to clean up late-game. It pairs well with specially offensive wallbreakers and setup sweepers such as Nasty Plot Thundurus and Throat Spray Yanmega, which can KO common Terrakion checks like Slowbro, Hippowdon, and Chesnaught with ease. Terrakion offers valuable support to teammates like Gengar and Maushold that fear Knock Off greatly, as its ability, Justified, acts as a strong deterrent against it. In addition, Terrakion can work well as a cleaner in entry hazard-stacking team structures, which try to wear down opposing teams, alongside setters such as Jirachi, Gligar, and Chesnaught, as many defensive Pokemon, such as Amoonguss and Suicune, only need to be chipped marginally to be in Terrakion's KO range after a Swords Dance. Sample set. Terrakion's high Speed and access to perfect coverage mean that it is an ideal Choice Scarf user that outspeeds most other Choice Scarf users in the tier, making it an excellent revenge killer. Earthquake helps it deal with Poison-types such as Fezandipiti and Revavroom. Rock Slide gives Terrakion a more reliable Rock-type move to use by trading power for accuracy. Stealth Rock allows Terrakion to act as an entry hazard setter that is able to get it up on Pokemon it forces out like Choice Scarf Krookodile locked into Knock Off. Justified allows Terrakion to switch into Dark-type attacks and punish moves like Knock Off from Cyclizar to boost its Attack. Tera Rock helps Terrakion by boosting its Rock-type moves, helping it clean up versus foes that don't resist Rock and threatening a 2HKO on Amoonguss and Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock. Tera Ground boosts Earthquake's damage and threatens an OHKO on Fezandipti while giving Terrakion an immunity to Electric-type attacks and Thunder Wave from Thundurus. Choice Scarf Terrakion fits best on balance and bulky offense teams, as it is a great revenge killer that can outspeed common Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Krookodile. Chesnaught and Hippowdon make for good partners that offer utility like entry hazards and Rocky Helmet chip damage that weaken the opposing Pokemon and make it easier for Terrakion to clean. Sand Stream Hippowdon can also set up sandstorm for Terrakion, giving it a Special Defense boost and allowing it to switch into special attacks it normally shouldn't. Terrakion struggles into strong physical walls like Hippowdon, Slowbro, and Galarian Weezing, which can stop it from cleaning, so bulky partners like Salamence, Talonflame, and Wo-Chien are appreciated, as they can take hits for Terrakion and force these walls out. Wallbreakers like Crawdaunt and special attackers like Magnezone and Hisuian Zoroark can also weaken the aforementioned walls while making it much easier for Terrakion to clean up. Future Sight support from Slowbro and Reuniclus makes it harder for physical walls to switch in and particularly punishes Poison-types such as Amoonguss and Galarian Weezing, allowing Terrakion to use its STAB moves more often instead of locking into Earthquake."

  "Thundurus": {
    "name": "Thundurus",
    "text": "Thundurus is an incredibly threatening offensive presence due to its wide array of coverage moves and ability to spread paralysis on would-be switch-ins. It benefits from a lack of specially defensive walls in the tier. Focus Blast chunks common Thundurus checks such as Hisuian Goodra and Assault Vest Cyclizar for a good amount of damage. Knock Off is an alternative utility option for making progress in general by taking away Heavy-Duty Boots, Leftovers, and Assault Vest from defensive switch-ins such as Fezandipiti, Umbreon, and Cyclizar and reducing their longevity. Grass Knot is good for punishing Ground-type switch-ins such as Krookodile and Hippowdon attempting to block Volt Switch or Thunder Wave. Psychic covers a different set of checks in Fezandipiti, Amoonguss, and Chesnaught and pairs well with Focus Blast to keep Thundurus from being completely walled by Krookodile. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Thundurus to pivot throughout the game without suffering Stealth Rock damage. Tera Fairy is useful for denying a Dragon-type STAB move from Hisuian Goodra or Cyclizar in a pinch, removing Thundurus's Stealth Rock weakness, and allowing it to comfortably take common Dark-type attacks such as Knock Off and Bisharp's Sucker Punch. Utility Thundurus fits well on a variety of structures, particularly balance and offensive teams that can capitalize on its strong pivot support and paralysis. Useful teammates for Thundurus include Pokemon that can take advantage of paralyzed foes such as Iron Head Jirachi, Hex Gengar, and Hex Basculegion-F as well as setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Gyarados that love getting off extra boosts. Wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt and Conkeldurr pair well with Thundurus, as their middling Speed tiers benefit greatly from paralysis support; moreover, they can comfortably take a hit from and exploit defensive Thundurus checks, particularly Cyclizar, Hisuian Goodra, and Wo-Chien, by coming in after a Volt Switch. Thundurus appreciates partners like Cyclizar, Wo-Chien, and Gastrodon that can absorb hits from Electric-type checks such as Magnezone, while Ground-types like Krookodile and Flygon can threaten these same Electric-types offensively. Other paralysis spreaders like Body Slam Jirachi and Thunder Wave Slowbro can be used alongside Thundurus to cripple as much of the opponent's team as possible and provide additional support to the game plan of taking advantage of paralyzed Pokemon. Structures that rely on entry hazards to chip down the opposing team combine well with Thundurus due to its ability to pivot and remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which is supplemented further by additional U-turn or Volt Switch users. Thundurus also benefits from defensive partners such as Hippowdon, Galarian Weezing, and Chesnaught that can easily come in on a Knock Off. Nasty Plot Thundurus is among the best setup sweepers in the tier, capitalizing on its great Speed and access to diverse coverage options. Deceptively bulky, Thundurus can often tank a hit from would-be checks before steamrolling through a team with Nasty Plot and three attacks of its choosing. Focus Blast lets Thundurus hit common checks like Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra but can also heavily punish Pokemon like Bisharp, Wo-Chien, Magnezone, and Umbreon for super effective damage. Grass Knot can be used for Ground-types like Gastrodon, Hippowdon, Krookodile, and Palossand. Tera Blast is usually run on Tera Flying sets that take advantage of the extra boost from Terastallization, giving Thundurus the Flying-type STAB it desperately wants to threaten Grass- and Fighting-types like Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Slither Wing. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents entry hazards from wearing Thundurus down. Prankster gives priority to Nasty Plot so it can't be stopped from setting up by a faster Taunt from Azelf, Cyclizar, and Noivern. Tera Fairy gives key resistances to attacks like Bisharp Sucker Punch and Cyclizar Draco Meteor and Dragon Tail while retaining the important resistance to Fighting against Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Slither Wing. Tera Flying gives Thundurus the capacity to OHKO key threats like Conkeldurr, Amoonguss, and Breloom. Thundurus fits well on most structures and is often found on balance and offensive teams as a setup sweeper that can take advantage of its excellent movepool. Held back partly by its lack of Flying-type coverage, Thundurus can be a bit reliant on Tera to break through teams, meaning Pokemon like Amoonguss and Cyclizar that don't rely on Tera much are great support teammates. Amoonguss is a notable teammate because it can switch into many Choice Scarf physical attackers like Krookodile and Mienshao that threaten to KO Thundurus. Offensive teammates like Mienshao and Terrakion can synergize with Thundurus as Knock Off switch-ins, allowing Thundurus to maintain its Heavy-Duty Boots to preserve health. Defensive partners like Jirachi and Slowbro can spread Paralysis with Body Slam and Thunder Wave, respectively, allowing offensive Thundurus to set up and break its checks more efficiently. Tera Blast Thundurus likes to be a late-game cleaner, so teammates that can pivot like Barraskewda, Jirachi, and Slither Wing are excellent in putting Thundurus checks like Fezandipiti, Hisuian Goodra, and Umbreon into range for it to set up and sweep, especially when paired with entry hazard setters like Chesnaught and Gligar to capitalize on gradual chip damage through the forced switches. Grass Knot and Tera Blast require different team support, so teammates and their coverage options can vary drastically and cover the spectrum of defensive answers to either set. Entry hazard removal helps in the event Thundurus loses its item, so Cyclizar, Galarian Weezing, and Noivern are valuable teammates."

  "Thundurus-Therian": {

    "text": "Nasty Plot takes Thundurus-T's already monstrous Special Attack and amplifies it to be a destroyer of balance builds, being nigh unwallable after a boost and functioning as a key early-game wallbreaker for its team that also happens to counter Zapdos, enabling physical sweepers like Azumarill and Scizor. At +2, Thundurus-T is able to OHKO numerous bulky foes such as Metagross, Okidogi, Hydrapple, and defensive Zapdos and 2HKO others such as Pecharunt and Tinkaton with Thunderbolt. Sludge Bomb provides key coverage to nail Hydrapple and Serperior while being a strong neutral move against Latios. It also covers Tera Fairy users such as Skeledirge and Okidogi. Focus Blast drops the likes of Excadrill and Mamoswine unboosted and OHKOes Sandy Shocks and Rhyperior at +2. Tera Steel avoids revenge killing attempts from faster threats such as Ogerpon-C and Latios. Meanwhile, Tera Water stops Greninja from using Surf and Ice Beam to nail Thundurus-T and allows Thundurus-T to reactively answer Quaquaval and Belly Drum Azumarill, both of which are threats to the hyper offense teams Nasty Plot Thundurus-T finds itself on. Nasty Plot Thundurus-T best fits on hyper offense teams that enable it to wallbreak early in the game. Entry hazard setters like Mew and Excadrill are key to wear down bulky foes like Pecharunt and Assault Vest Okidogi into range of +2 Thunderbolt. Greninja is a phenomenal teammate, being a constant source of offensive pressure against faster foes like Latios and Serperior while working to overwhelm the likes of Tinkaton and Okidogi. Comfey offensively pressures numerous revenge killers such as Latios, Lokix, and Keldeo. Physical wallbreakers like Ogerpon-C and Azumarill can take out Ground-types such as Hippowdon, Donphan, and Sandy Shocks. Both Ogerpon-C and Greninja also excel at overwhelming Skeledirge or forcing it to Terastallize at least, with Thundurus-T having the ability to get heavy damage on all variants post-Tera. Quaquaval and Mimikyu help out in the opposing offense matchup and break past annoying Pokemon like Greninja and Latios. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens support, allowing Thundurus-T to boost more freely without fearing revenge killing from Pokemon such as Lokix and Zarude."

  "Ting-Lu": {
    "name": "Ting-Lu",
    "text": "With incredible bulk, Vessel of Ruin, and access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, Ting-Lu is one of OU's premier hazard setters and also doubles as a special wall. Spikes are used to hit grounded Stealth Rock-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit and Gholdengo harder, while Stealth Rock can be used instead to damage Spikes-immune Pokemon like Corviknight that repeatedly switch into Ting-Lu, as well as punish Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth and Enamorus. Thanks to its huge bulk, Ting-Lu is able to take super effective hits from setup sweepers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder and phaze them with Whirlwind in return; in addition to this, Whirlwind forces in opposing Pokemon, which will take damage from Ting-Lu's hazards unless they hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Ruination deals meaningful damage to switch-ins like Rillaboom, Great Tusk, and Hatterene while forcing walls like Alomomola, Garganacl, and Clefable to waste their recovery moves. Leftovers provides consistent recovery, while Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Ting-Lu from getting overwhelmed by entry hazards, mainly Spikes from opposing hazard-stacking teams. Alternatively, Red Card allows Ting-Lu to take a hit from a threatening foe—specifically a setup sweeper—and force it out, taking advantage of its huge overall bulk to even take on physical attackers and super effective special attacks, such as from Roaring Moon and Hatterene. Tera Poison is used to help Ting-Lu better check Fairy- and Fighting-types like Enamorus, Zamazenta, and especially Iron Valiant and grant it an immunity to Toxic, while Tera Ghost can be run instead to nullify Ting-Lu's Fighting-type weakness and allow it to spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads, though this comes at the cost of being weak to Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult as well as Dark-types like Darkrai, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon that Ting-Lu would otherwise check. Ting-Lu fits well as a support option on nearly any balance team. Offensive partners like Dragapult and Zamazenta appreciate entry hazard support to make foes easier to KO, while physically defensive partners like Dondozo and Skarmory benefit from Ting-Lu's ability to handle special attackers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt. Skarmory is particularly notable for forming a strong defensive hazard-stacking core with Ting-Lu, being able to switch into Pokemon like Meowscarada and Weavile that threaten it. Aside from being potent late-game cleaners that appreciate Ting-Lu spreading chip damage early-game, offensive partners like Weavile and Meowscarada pair well, since they're able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon with Knock Off to make Ting-Lu's hazard stacking more effective as well as pressure Gliscor, which Ting-Lu struggles significantly against. Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo are both great defensive partners for Ting-Lu to handle Fairy-types like Hatterene and Iron Valiant, with the former able to provide additional pressure with Future Sight and the latter also able to block hazard removal."

  "Tinkaton": {
    "name": "Tinkaton",
    "text": "Tinkaton's good matchup against Mandibuzz makes it a strong Stealth Rock setter that uses its typing to get plenty of entry hazard-setting chances. Certain teams prefer Tinkaton to use Thunder Wave, though, since they can fit another Stealth Rock setter; this can help significantly when dealing with foes like Latios and Spiky Shield Ogerpon-C. Knock Off is excellent utility that prevents Tinkaton from being passive, removing items from Excadrill, Zapdos, and Hisuian Arcanine. Encore is Tinkaton's most useful asset, letting it use its typing and bulk to checkmate foes like Latios and Hydrapple. Leftovers is preferred on Mold Breaker sets so that Tinkaton has some longevity, with Mold Breaker proving useful to let it OHKO Ogerpon-C and Mimikyu despite their abilities. Pickpocket with an Air Balloon can let it steal items from Excadrill, Ogerpon, and Lokix, which can help immensely in fending these threats off. The given EVs allow Tinkaton to KO Latios with Knock Off followed by Gigaton Hammer while surviving a +2 Superpower from Ogerpon-C. Play Rough is a niche option that lets Tinkaton more directly pressure Greninja and Latios, but it is extremely weak against foes it doesn't hit super effectively. Tera Flying lets Tinkaton use Encore after Excadrill's Earthquake. Tera Dark helps Tinkaton against strong Psychic-type attackers like Hoopa-U and Choice Specs Latios, while Tera Dragon lets it check Greninja and Belly Drum Azumarill. Tinkaton's incredible typing and utility let it fit on all kinds of bulky offense and balance teams, using Stealth Rock to support teammates like Tyranitar and Lokix that love to weaken checks with Knock Off. It's also a good partner for teammates like Sandy Shocks and Rotom-W that dislike dealing with Latios. Tinkaton's flexibility lets it use its bulk to tank huge attacks and lock foes into them with Encore; for example, it often needs to lock Greninja into Surf or Okidogi into Drain Punch. As such, teammates that can handle these attacks like Slowking and Hydrapple can be very useful to have. They also help signficantly against Excadrill, which Tinkaton tends to let in for free. Teams that use Tinkaton should aim to make progress fairly quickly; while it's a great stopgap to all kinds of threats, its lack of reliable recovery prevents it from lasting forever, so it needs progress-making teammates like Hisuian Arcanine and Mamoswine, which can help it create favorable game states."

After one turn, Torchic is able to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, only matched by Choice Scarf Pokemon like Mienfoo and Hisuian Growlithe. Tera Blast Ground hits Pokemon such as Mareanie, Glimmet, and Hisuian Growlithe, while Tera Blast Psychic can hit the former two targets while giving Torchic a more reliable way to hit Mienfoo. Protect gives Torchic an easy way to activate Speed Boost, while Substitute can be used to scout Terastallization. Both moves also serve to guard Torchic from priority moves such as Fake Out from Mienfoo and Sucker Punch from Alolan Diglett and Stunky, which trouble Torchic due to its low bulk, lack of Eviolite, and weakness to Stealth Rock. Passive Pokemon such as Tinkatink and Toedscool appreciate Torchic's ability to output high amounts of damage and can return the favor in the form of utility such as Knock Off and status moves in Thunder Wave from Tinkatink and Spore from Toedscool. Tinkatink also sets up Stealth Rock to boost Torchic's offensive presence, while Toedscool can set up Spikes. Torchic struggles against Pokemon that resist its Fire Blast such as Mareanie and Vullaby, making Mudbray a good partner. Shellder and Torchic make a good offensive pairing, as one can both force out a foe's Terastallization so the other partner can break through it. Torchic's weakness to entry hazards makes teammates such as Rapid Spin Toedscool and Defog Vullaby beneficial partners."

    "name": "Tornadus-Therian",
    "text": "Tornadus-T is a very important pivot in the metagame, making use of its high Speed and Knock Off to help force progress against opposing teams and U-turn to pivot out on switch-ins like Zapdos and Rotom-W while remaining healthy with Regenerator. Hurricane is an option over Bleakwind Storm if one wants to sacrifice accuracy for power and a confusion chance. Heat Wave provides coverage for Steel-types like Scizor, Excadrill, and Tinkaton, while Focus Blast is less accurate but is more powerful and hits Rock-types like Tyranitar and Hisuian Arcanine. Taunt is an option on Heavy-Duty Boots sets that disrupts utility moves like Thunder Wave from Slowking and Defog or Toxic from Mandibuzz, but it is often not worth losing out on coverage. Assault Vest helps Tornadus-T sponge powerful special attacks from threats like Latios, Greninja, and Hydrapple. Alternatively, it can opt for Heavy-Duty Boots to allow it to make the most out of Regenerator without a Stealth Rock weakness. 192 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow it to outspeed Serperior and base 110 Speed Pokemon like Latios and Ogerpon-C, while 208 HP and 108 Special Defense EVs give it a good chance to withstand Choice Specs Latios's Draco Meteor from full HP, even without an Assault Vest. Tera Steel allows Tornadus-T to more easily switch into Latios and Hydrapple, helps it sponge hits from Ogerpon-C, and gives it a resistance to Stealth Rock. Tera Electric allows Tornadus-T to switch into Flying-types like Zapdos and opposing Tornadus-T while protecting it from Zapdos's Static. However, it is important to note that using these Tera types makes Tornadus-T weak to Ground and susceptible to Spikes, so Terastallization generally shouldn't be used unless needed. Pivot Tornadus-T fits on both offense and balance teams, utilizing its ability to force progress and its high Speed to help wear down the opposing team and bring in its teammates. However, having an Assault Vest means that it is susceptible to Stealth Rock damage, and thus, it appreciates having teammates that can remove entry hazards like Excadrill and Mandibuzz. Heavy-Duty Boots sets do not need as much but require backup checks to foes such as Greninja and Latios. It also appreciates other pivots like Zapdos and Lokix to help it switch in and out more to heal as well as additional Regenerator Pokemon for it to switch into like Hydrapple and Slowking. These Regenerator pivots make it easier for Tornadus-T to make use of its own Regenerator while also helping answer offensive threats it cannot handle like Rhyperior or Hisuian Arcanine. Hydrapple, as well as other Grass-types like Zarude and Sinistcha, also provides a second Ground-resistant team member should Tornadus-T be forced to Terastallize. Tornadus-T also appreciates Ground-types that can absorb Volt Switch from Zapdos such as Rhyperior, Hippowdon, and Sandy Shocks. Tornadus-T can be paired alongside fast offensive threats like Ogerpon to provide a team two fast progress-makers that can overwhelm defensive Pokemon like Hydrapple, Zapdos, and opposing Tornadus-T, and it also fits well alongside wallbreakers such as Mamoswine and Latios, which appreciate its ability to pivot them in. Tornadus-T's fantastic Speed tier allows it to outspeed and force out many common threats such as Keldeo and Ogerpon, granting it many opportunities to set up a Nasty Plot. This turns it into a powerful wallbreaker that can muscle through standard checks such as Tinkaton, Slowking, and Toxapex. Hurricane's additional power is significant, notably guaranteeing the OHKO on Keldeo, OHKOing bulkier variants of Azumarill at +2, and having a high chance to OHKO Latios after a Nasty Plot boost. Bleakwind Storm can still be considered, as it is slightly more reliable but will require support from entry hazards to make up for the slight drop in power. Heat Wave provides coverage to nail Steel-types like Tinkaton, Excadrill, and Metagross while also being a more reliable move into offensive threats like Lokix and Ogerpon. It is also one of Tornadus-T's best means to hit other Flying-resistant foes like Zapdos and Raikou for neutral damage. Focus Blast provides the necessary coverage to OHKO Pokemon like Tyranitar and Hisuian Arcanine. Weather Ball is an option on weather teams that allows Tornadus-T to OHKO Zapdos and opposing Tornadus-T in sand, as well as threatening the aforementioned Pokemon and Sandy Shocks in snow. U-turn is an alternative that provides some utility, allowing Tornadus-T to switch out of unfavorable matchups against Rhyperior and Empoleon to bring in a partner more capable of dealing with them. The EV spread has enough Speed to outpace base 115s like Raikou and Cinccino, while the bulk prevents it from being OHKOed by Tera Bug Silver Powder-boosted First Impression from Lokix. Tera Electric removes its Electric weakness in a pinch to better deal with Zapdos and Raikou while also avoiding Thunder Wave from Slowking and Tinkaton. Tornadus-T fits best on a variety of playstyles such as hyper offense, which can apply enough offensive pressure to defensive structures, or bulky offense and balance teams that can provide a strong enough backbone to support a more offensive set. Toxapex and Slowking can form a Regenerator core with Tornadus-T, which can help offset the severity of any drawbacks from it potentially missing a move against Pokemon such as Azumarill and Latios. Slowking can also provide Thunder Wave support to cripple faster threats to Tornadus-T such as Greninja and use Chilly Reception to bring Tornadus-T in against Pokemon like Hydrapple while setting snow if using Weather Ball. Skeledirge is a pain for Tornadus-T to break through, so partners like Hisuian Arcanine and Tyranitar can apply pressure to it, the former two also having a great matchup against Zapdos that Tornadus-T can struggle to break without Terastilizing into an Electric-type. Sandy Shocks can also help pressure Zapdos and provide entry hazard support, like the three aforementioned Pokemon, to help wear down Tornadus-T's checks. Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Hisuian Arcanine, and Rhyperior are massive problems for Tornadus-T to break if it lacks Focus Blast, so partners like Keldeo and Greninja are ideal, and they all greatly appreciate being brought in safely against them if Tornadus-T is running U-turn. Lokix and Scizor invite Zapdos in and remove its Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, allowing it to be weakened into range of a Nasty Plot-boosted Heat Wave. They can also bring Tornadus-T in safely against Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Okidogi to find opportunities to set up a Nasty Plot to start wallbreaking. Their strong priority moves are also extremely beneficial for removing faster foes such as Choice Scarf Latios and Greninja."

  "Torterra": {
    "name": "Torterra",
    "text": "Torterra excels as a setup sweeper on hyper offense teams, using Shell Smash to boost its stats and power through foes. Torterra has all the coverage it needs with Rock Blast, as it hits Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel that might otherwise threaten to wall and KO Torterra. It can also work around some of its checks with Tera Blast, improving its matchup into Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena. Torterra's high base Defense and solid defensive typing provide it ample opportunities to set up against foes like Basculegion and Swampert. While Torterra can somewhat choose its checks with Rock Blast and Tera Blast Fire, it cannot run both, and as a result can be checked by Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena or by Flying-types like Talonflame. Furthermore, Torterra's low base Speed makes it vulnerable to being outsped and revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Munkidori, Flygon, and Mienshao, even after a Shell Smash boost, meaning it often requires Sticky Web support. Priority, such as Flygon's First Impression and Toxicroak's Sucker Punch, can also end a potential sweep, as Torterra often lowers its Defense with Shell Smash and Headlong Rush. Bullet Seed is a powerful STAB move but requires Loaded Dice to be effective, while Wood Hammer provides immediate power without requiring an item slot but forces Torterra to take recoil. Earthquake is a strong move without a drawback, but Headlong Rush provides even more power, with the downside of defensive stat drops. Rock Blast, like Bullet Seed, requires Loaded Dice to be effective, but it provides necessary coverage against Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel. Tera Ghost can be used defensively, removing Torterra's existing weaknesses and adding an immunity to Fighting-type attacks, which can be useful against revenge killers like Mach Punch Breloom and Choice Scarf Mienshao. Tera Blast Fire can OHKO defensive Grass-types like Tsareena and Vileplume. Tera Fire also prevents Torterra from being burned. Since Flying-types like Talonflame, Tornadus, and Kilowattrel naturally outspeed Torterra and deal great damage with their STAB moves, Torterra may want to opt for Tera Electric, giving it a resistance to their Flying-type STAB moves and maintaining its immunity to Thunder Wave. If not using Loaded Dice along with Bullet Seed and Rock Blast, Torterra can utilize White Herb to restore its defenses after Shell Smash, making it a more reliable setup sweeper. While a Jolly nature lets Torterra outspeed foes such as Choice Scarf Chandelure and Heracross, Adamant can be run on Sticky Web teams for more power. Torterra's low Speed makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Mienshao, Munkidori, and Inteleon, so Sticky Web users like Araquanid and Galvantula support it well. Choice Scarf Flygon has Levitate to be immune to Sticky Web, so faster Choice Scarf users like Munkidori and Mienshao can help Torterra handle it. Additional physical breakers can weaken Torterra's checks and finish them off after Torterra is stopped, so teammates like Swords Dance Toxicroak and Dragon Dance Flygon and Iron Thorns pair well with it; the first handles Grass-types, the second and third can weaken them for Torterra, and the last can also handle Flying-types like Talonflame and Kilowattrel. Teammates such as Chandelure and Tornadus that can target Grass-types like Vileplume and Tsareena are also appreciated, weakening or outright removing these checks to Torterra. Fire-types like Chandelure, Hisuian Typhlosion, and Incineroar appreciate Torterra's support against Water- and Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon. On non-Loaded Dice sets, Torterra can choose Stone Edge as an alternative to Tera Blast for coverage that does not require Tera, but accuracy can become a problem. Torterra can also run moves like Zen Headbutt and Crunch to hit specific targets like Vileplume and Bronzong without Terastallizing; however, they are fairly niche or outclassed by other options. Grass-types: Torterra's STAB moves cannot hit Grass-types, such as Tsareena, Vileplume, and Brambleghast, so it is forced to rely on Tera Blast Fire to hit them, which some sets may not carry. Flying-types: Flying-types like Talonflame, Kilowattrel, and Tornadus don't fear Torterra's STAB moves, and even when Torterra carries coverage like Rock Blast, it can be inaccurate. These foes also outspeed unboosted Torterra, and Talonflame in particular may burn it if it predicts that Torterra will not Terastallize Fire. Revenge Killers: Torterra's low Speed makes it vulnerable to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Munkidori, as well as priority like Toxicroak's Sucker Punch and Flygon's First Impression. Flygon in particular is dangerous, as its Choice Scarf set cannot be slowed by Sticky Web due to Levitate, and it frequently uses Tera Steel."

  "Toucannon": {
    "name": "Toucannon",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1 point Overview: Toucannon is a final-round pick that serves as a niche wallbreaker and late-game cleaner, but it fails to do so effectively in most cases. Boasting a high Attack, it can certainly break many defensive cores with its moves that make use of Skill Link, and it can be a nuisance with Beak Blast and Knock Off. Unfortunately, despite its colorful movepool and great utility moves, its poor bulk and disappointing Speed tier do not allow it to make any use of them. It should only be drafted as a final pick if the draft functions well without it, since it's realistically going to warm up the bench in most games. Wallbreaker: Toucannon's high Attack stat and varied movepool means it can act as a good wallbreaker, but very occasionally. While it lacks good Normal-type STAB moves, STAB Brave Bird coupled with coverage to hit Steel-types in Temper Flare and Brick Break allows it to break some defensive cores. Knock Off and U-turn pair nicely together to get rid of a big threat's item and get itself out of its bad matchups, but it is often too slow and frail to use them properly. Primary STAB Moves: Brave Bird, Beak Blast, Boomburst, Acrobatics, Facade Setup Moves: Swords Dance, Flame Charge Utility Moves: Roost, Encore, U-turn, Knock Off, Substitute Coverage Moves: Bullet Seed, Rock Blast, Temper Flare, Brick Break, Gunk Shot, Throat Chop, Seed Bomb Tailwind: If Toucannon can survive a hit or outspeed a Pokemon to set up Tailwind, it can somewhat bypass its low Speed tier to break opposing teams and stop revenge killers more easily. Tailwind can also be used to support the rest of the team and allow them to invest into other stats rather than Speed. Nevertheless, Toucannon often struggles to get Tailwind up due to its poor bulk. Heavy-Duty Boots: Heavy-Duty Boots ignores Toucannon's weakness to Stealth Rock, providing it with more longevity and the ability to switch in as well as set up more safely. Damage-boosting Items: Items such as Expert Belt and Choice Band make use of Toucannon's wide-ranging movepool while maximizing its damage output. Life Orb is also very useful, as it takes advantage of Sheer Force Choice Scarf: Choice Scarf lets Toucannon outspeed many foes to get a surprise KO, making it capable of revenge killing, pivoting out of bad matchups, and serving as a late-game cleaner with enough chip. Focus Sash: Toucannon's inability to be a fast glass cannon or bulky attacker means it tends to get outsped by most Pokemon and OHKOed by most attacks. Focus Sash allows it to survive longer than it is expected to and get a hit off on faster Pokemon. To be frank, while Tera can help Toucannon, it is almost always heavily outclassed by other secondary Tera Captains at its price. You will always have better Tera Captain options over Toucannon. Toucannon is exclusively an offensive Pokemon and fits on teams that are self-sufficient without it. It can have a few favorable matchups, but that requires a lot of smart pivoting to get it in safely, and these favorable matchups are few and far between. A Functioning Team: Toucannon's minimal cost and viability should be more than enough to stop you from building a whole team around it. It typically fits on teams that already have their offensive pieces in their respective places, since it can add a little bit more offense when the opportunity presents itself. Steel-types: Toucannon fails at doing any real damage to Steel-types on its own, even with the super effective coverage moves it has. Steel types like Hisuian Goodra, Jirachi, and Corviknight are some Pokemon that check it well. Electric-types: Electric-type Pokemon like Zapdos, Jolteon, and Rotom-W are huge threats to Toucannon as a result of them resisting its Flying-type STAB moves, and they can freely use Volt Switch on it. This means it can get picked off early and provide the opposing team with momentum. Wallbreakers: Toucannon is outsped by almost every offensive threat, which accompanied with its mediocre bulk leaves it susceptible to being revenge killed quite often. Most wallbreakers are faster or bulkier than it, which can prevent it from getting any hits off. A few examples are Dragonite, Thundurus-T, and Weavile. Status: Being afflicted with burn, poison, or paralysis can take Toucannon out of the game completely, hindering its wallbreaking abilities and taking away from its already-nonexistent longevity with burn and poison."

  "Toxapex": {
    "name": "Toxapex",
    "text": "Toxapex holds a niche as a strong mixed wall, being able to effectively hold the line against a plethora of strong neutral hits and healing off large portions of damage through a combination of Recover and Regenerator. Compared to Liquidation, Surf allows Toxapex to avoid Zapdos's Static, achieves a 3HKO against Lokix, and does more damage to Rhyperior while also having more PP. Liquidation deals more damage to Tyranitar and bulkier variants of Excadrill, and it also allows Toxapex to utilize its bulk by fishing for Defense drops. Toxic and Haze form a potent combination and prevent Toxapex from being vulnerable to setup sweepers like Hydrapple and Azumarill while also making it a reliable stopgap against Battle Bond Greninja. Toxic also allows it to threaten bulkier foes like Slowking, Tornadus-T, and Hippowdon by putting them on a timer. Heavy-Duty Boots expands Toxapex's longevity, while Rocky Helmet can be used to punish physically oriented pivots like Scizor and Lokix. Leftovers provides passive recovery that compounds with Regenerator and alleviates the need to use Recover. The given EV spread allows Toxapex to avoid being 2HKOed by Hisuian Arcanine's Head Smash as well as avoiding the OHKO from non-Choice Specs Latios's Luster Purge. Toxapex's Tera type is largely customizable based on the needs of the team; Tera Fairy is a strong neutral defensive typing that maintains Toxapex's resistances to Bug and Fighting while giving it an immunity to Dragon, while Tera Ground allows it to function as an emergency check to Zapdos and Thundurus-T. Options such as Tera Steel to maintain Toxapex's Steel and Fairy resistances and immunity to Toxic are also viable. Toxapex fits best on balance teams that appreciate the unique options it provides over Slowking, most notably Haze and Toxic. For this reason, it pairs exceptionally well with Pokemon that struggle against Slowking, such as Rhyperior, Tinkaton, and Tornadus-T, creating a solid defensive backbone with the former two and a Regenerator core with the latter. Tinkaton and Tornadus-T in particular are appreciated due to their ability to check Latios, which can power through Toxapex with ease. Hydrapple is a strong partner thanks to its Ground resistance and its ability to form a Regenerator core with Toxapex. Mandibuzz is a particularly good partner thanks to its ability to remove entry hazards with Defog and function as a backup check to Hoopa-U and Latios while also appreciating Toxapex's ability to stave off Belly Drum Azumarill. In a similar vein, Toxapex is also appreciated on sand teams because it can cut into the longevity of bulkier foes, especially when Toxic is compounded with the chip damage from sand, making it easier for Pokemon like Excadrill and Ogerpon-C to bulldoze the opposing team. In return, these Pokemon can remove troublesome foes like Zapdos and Mamoswine that threaten Toxapex with heavy damage. Cobalion makes a good partner, as it can reliably check Swords Dance Ogerpon-C and Non-Terastillized Swords Dance Zarude, both of which can muscle through Toxapex with relative ease. In addition, Toxapex can struggle against other offensive staples like Hoopa-U and Thundurus-T, so revenge killers such as Lokix and Scizor or bulkier teammates that are not as vulnerable to these foes, such as Hippowdon and Rhyperior, are greatly appreciated."

  "Toxicroak": {
    "name": "Toxicroak",
    "text": "Toxicroak stands out for having the rare combination of Dry Skin and a great typing both offensively and defensively, which makes it the premier switch-in to Water-types like Vaporeon, Milotic, Paldean Tauros-W, Basculegion, and Inteleon. Toxicroak is also less susceptible to being revenge killed after it has set up; its access to priority moves makes it a lot harder to revenge kill despite its middling Speed. However, Toxicroak's biggest problem is its frailty; if it switches into any non-Water-type attack from these threats, it gets easily 2HKOed, but Toxicroak's good defensive typing gives it more opportunities to set up against foes like Vileplume, Choice Scarf Mienshao, and Tsareena. Toxicroak also struggles against physically defensive Ground- and Poison-types like Palossand, Galarian Slowbro, and Dragalge, as they can take both of its STAB attacks and proceed to threaten Toxicroak back with their own STAB moves. Additionally, Toxicroak also faces Fighting-type competition with Mienshao and Breloom, which are both stronger, making them more consistent at times. Close Combat is the preferred STAB option, allowing Toxicroak to 2HKO defensive walls like Alolan Muk and Klefki with Stealth Rock. Alternatively, Drain Punch helps provide more longevity against foes like Alolan Muk and Swampert, and it can counteract Life Orb chip if needed. Sucker Punch helps Toxicroak pick off revenge killers and weakened threats alike such as Munkidori and Flygon; Tera Dark allows Toxicroak to OHKO foes like Inteleon and Kilowattrel after a Swords Dance boost. Both Knock Off and Earthquake can be run in the last moveslot to hit checks like Palossand, Galarian Slowbro, and Dragalge harder, but Toxicroak's low Speed makes it prefer a priority move in most situations. A Jolly nature lets Toxicroak outspeed foes like Heracross and Chandelure, but an Adamant nature provides more wallbreaking power, allowing Toxicroak to OHKO Vileplume with a +2 Gunk Shot when it's boosted by Life Orb. Leftovers is the preferred item for Toxicroak, providing it needed recovery and letting it continually come in and check bulky Water-types. However, Life Orb provides Toxicroak a bit more extra wallbreaking power. Toxicroak best pairs with Pokemon that lure in bulkier Water-types such as Vaporeon and Milotic, so good partners would be Water-types like Inteleon and Basculegion and Fire-types like Incineroar and Talonflame, as all of them are able to pivot and give it a free switch into the aforementioned bulky Water-types. Inteleon is a noteworthy partner, as it checks the common Ground- and Fire-types like Flygon, Gligar, and Chandelure, and it can actually pivot on Water-immune Pokemon thanks to its access to U-turn, helping Inteleon keep up momentum. In return, Toxicroak can take advantage of bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Vaporeon, Tentacruel, and Tsareena. Toxicroak gets threatened by Psychic-types such as Indeedee-M, Meloetta, and Munkidori, so it pairs well with Dark- and Steel-types like Umbreon, Incineroar, and Bronzong that check the aforementioned Psychic-types. Poison-types like Dragalge and Galarian Slowbro can cause many problems for Toxicroak, making Psychic- and Ground-types like Meloetta, Flygon, and Swampert great partners. Ground-immune Pokemon like Talonflame, Rotom-C, and Bronzong are great partners for Toxicroak, as they are able to check Ground-types such as Flygon and Swampert. Toxicroak also appreciates Water- and Rock-types like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Diancie to consistently switch into Fire-types like Chandelure, Infernape, and Hisuian Typhlosion. Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-types like Galarian Slowbro, Chandelure, and Basculegion that would resist or be immune to its STAB attacks. Vacuum Wave can be used over Dark Pulse, allowing Toxicroak to KO revenge killers like Porygon-Z, Flygon, and Inteleon. A Timid nature allows Toxicroak to outspeed foes like non-Choice Scarf Chandelure and Basculegion, but a Modest nature allows it to OHKO foes like Swampert with a +2 Focus Blast. Life Orb is preferred for its immediate power, allowing Toxicroak to always 2HKO foes like Swampert and Sylveon, but Leftovers can provide Toxicroak needed recovery over the course of the battle. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse while giving Toxicroak an immunity to Psychic-type attacks from Meloetta and Munkidori. Tera Fighting gives both Toxicroak's Focus Blast and Vacuum Wave an extra power boost, allowing it to 2HKO foes like Alolan Muk, Registeel, and Diancie and pick foes off from higher health. Toxicroak pairs well with pivots like Inteleon, Flygon, and Incineroar, as they can bring in foes like Vaporeon, Vileplume, and Alolan Muk and give Toxicroak a free opportunity to set up. Faster Pokemon like Talonflame, Flygon, and Munkidori outspeed and destroy Toxicroak. Thus, it pairs with defensive walls like Vaporeon, Tsareena, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro to handle the aforementioned Pokemon. Toxicroak synergies best with Steel- and Dark-types like Bronzong, Umbreon, and Incineroar, as they can check Psychic-types such as Munkidori, Indeedee-M, and Meloetta. In return, Toxicroak can pressure and take advantage of the Fighting- and Fairy-types like Sylveon, Florges, and Mienshao that give these Pokemon trouble. Ground-types like Flygon, Swampert, and Palossand can tank Toxicroak's unboosted attacks and OHKO it with their Ground-type STAB moves. Therefore, Toxicroak partners well with bulky Water- and Grass-types like Vaporeon, Tsareena, and Vileplume, as they can check the aforementioned Ground-types. Choice Scarf Toxicroak can outspeed common threats like Chandelure, Infernape, and Flygon. However, its moves are quite exploitable if it's locked into them, as Pokemon that resist or are immune to its attacks are common. Air Balloon gives Toxicroak a useful immunity to Ground-type attacks, giving it more opportunities to set up. Alternatively, Shuca Berry lets Toxicroak better lure in and damage Flygon and Swampert, as it's discreet; however, the majority of the time, Toxicroak prefers to run other items. Ice Punch allows Toxicroak to hit Ground- and Dragon-types like Gligar, Flygon, and Dragalge, but Toxicroak struggles to fit it. Encore allows Toxicroak to take advantage of bulky setup sweepers and entry hazard leads like Cresselia, Swampert, and Sylveon by giving it a free opportunity to set up either Swords Dance or Nasty Plot. Ground-types: Flygon, Swampert, and Gastrodon threaten Toxicroak with their STAB Ground-type attacks, but none of them want to switch into a boosted Close Combat or Focus Blast. Quagsire can shut down Toxicroak's sweeping attempts with Unaware and destroy it with a STAB Earthquake. However, Quagsire fares a bit worse against Nasty Plot Toxicroak. Gligar resists both of Toxicroak's STAB attacks and uses it to set up entry hazards or hits it back with Earthquake. Palossand is especially noteworthy, though, as it blanks Fighting-type attacks, resists Poison-type moves, and doesn't take too much from Sucker Punch. Poison-types: Galarian Slowbro and Dragalge resist both of Toxicroak's STAB attacks, and they can either set up or hit it back with their own STAB attacks. Psychic-types: Munkidori and Meloetta destroy Toxicroak with their powerful STAB attacks. However, none of them want to switch into a boosted Dark Pulse, and they can also be picked off by Sucker Punch. Indeedee-M will always win in a one-on-one against Toxicroak due to Psychic Terrain, but it can't switch in."

  "Toxtricity": {
    "name": "Toxtricity",
    "text": "Toxtricity offers the liberty to swap between the roles of a Shift Gear cleaner and Throat Spray + Boomburst wallbreaker with the same set. Very few walls can take its Punk Rock-boosted attacks after Throat Spray activates––Ghost / Ground-type Pokemon like Golurk and Palossand being the only exceptions––making the likes of Gastrodon, Coalossal, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro shoddy switch-ins at best. This threat creates setup opportunities for Toxtricity, which can then outspeed most of the metagame at +2 and clean late-game. Tera Blast Ghost is its best coverage move, nailing would-be checks like Decidueye, Golurk, Palossand, and Bronzong; importantly, the defensive benefits of Tera Ghost include more setup opportunities for Toxtricity and immunity to common priority attacks from Ambipom and Arcanine. Alternatively, Tera Normal offers a nuke of a Boomburst that outright OHKOes foes like Bellibolt and Mudsdale at +1. This comes at the cost of running the weaker Snarl to hit Ghost-types, and while Snarl offers good coverage without Terastallizing, it fails to reliably OHKO any of the metagame's Ghost-types and also makes Toxtricity completely walled by Soundproof Pokemon like Hisuian Electrode. A last alternative is Sludge Bomb, and in the same vein as Snarl, it can be a stronger option versus some walls like Wo-Chien without having to use Tera Normal Boomburst, but it fails to address some targets such as Golurk and Palossand. Sweepers such as Paldean Tauros-W and Decidueye alleviate some offensive tension that Toxtricity suffers from by targeting foes that could otherwise check it like Golurk, Goodra, and Gligar. Knock Off users like Skuntank and Scrafty help wear down walls like Mudsdale and Bellibolt so that they are KOed by a +1 Boomburst late-game. Specially offensive Knock Off users like Goodra and Salazzle also work for weakening special walls like Galarian Slowbro and Gastrodon; the former is in OHKO range from +1 Boomburst after Stealth Rock if it loses its Assault Vest. Toxtricity is often vulnerable to priority attackers after it takes damage when setting up, so teammates like Paldean Tauros-F and Staraptor are valid checks to the likes of Skuntank and Decidueye, respectively. This way, Toxtricity can be preserved and return the favor to these physically offensive teammates by putting pressure on physical walls like Mudsdale and Milotic. The raw power of Choice Specs, Punk Rock-boosted Boomburst, and strong STAB moves, with the option to be even stronger with Terastallization, is hard to stomach. That power, along with the opportunity to pivot with Volt Switch on the few checks Toxtricity has like Decidueye, makes Toxtricity an effective wallbreaker and pivot. Ghost-types like Golurk and Palossand are not safe switch-ins to Toxtricity given that Snarl 2HKOes them, albeit locking into Snarl can be prediction reliant. Sludge Bomb offers chances to OHKO walls like Wo-Chien and Florges, although its damage is equal to Tera Normal Boomburst and its coverage fails to nail anything notable bar Soundproof Hisuian Electrode. Due to relying heavily on prediction and Terastallization, this set sees less use and is harder to fit on teams in comparison to Toxtricity's Shift Gear set. One of Toxtricity's shortcomings is its frailty, so it relies on pivots such as Scyther, Staraptor, and Ambipom to get in safely. These teammates make an offensive VoltTurn core with Toxtricity, which returns the favor by positioning them through Volt Switch on some of its potential switch-ins like Decidueye and Galarian Slowbro. Dark-types like Bombirdier and Skuntank are necessary to punish opposing Ghost-types once Toxtricity is locked into Boomburst. Similarly, teammates such as Decidueye and Kilowattrel are important to defeat Ground-types like Gligar and Gastrodon. Toxtricity's wallbreaking can pave the way for specially offensive teammates like Calm Mind Scream Tail and Choice Scarf Florges to clean late-game. Spikes support from Alolan Sandslash and Qwilfish is noteworthy in supporting Toxtricity's wallbreaking, as a single layer of Spikes creates favorable chances to OHKO walls like Gastrodon and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro with +1 Tera Normal Boomburst. Sample set. Stay tuned for updates!"

  "Trapinch": {
    "name": "Trapinch",
    "text": "Although it suffers competition from Gothita as a trapper, Trapinch is one of LC's best Pokemon thanks to its decent bulk, good coverage, and sky-high Attack stat. Stone Edge gives Trapinch EdgeQuake coverage and allows it to hit Pokemon like Vullaby and Gastly. Trapinch's third moveslot is very flexible; Feint allows Trapinch to have another priority option on top of First Impression, allowing it to reliably revenge kill foes that run Protect like Shellder. However, Stealth Rock gives Trapinch utility, allowing it to support its own team. First Impression gives Trapinch the ability to revenge kill Pokemon like Gothita, Hisuian Voltorb, and Toedscool. Tera Bug gives Trapinch a useful boost to First Impression, although it does give it an unfavorable weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Rock is also an option, as it boosts Stone Edge, provides a useful resistance to Fire- and Flying-type attacks, and helps beat Pokemon like Hisuian Growlithe and Vullaby. The given EV spread allows Trapinch to outspeed and reliably trap Snubbull and Foongus. Trapinch's ability to reliably take on and trap a variety of threats like Hisuian Growlithe, Stunky, and Pawniard enables teammates like Vullaby and Doduo, which struggle against these Pokemon. Trapinch is particularly excellent against Steel-types like Pawniard, Tinkatink, and Alolan Diglett; therefore, Pokemon that enjoy having these foes removed like Foongus, Minccino, and Gastly make good partners. VoltTurn support from Pokemon like Mienfoo, Vullaby, and Hisuian Voltorb can give Trapinch a safe opportunity to switch in and trap a threat."

  "Tsareena": {
    "name": "Tsareena",
    "text": "Tsareena is NU's best entry hazard remover, and for good reason: it easily beats the plethora of Grass-weak hazard setters like Rhyperior, Swampert, and Diancie, and even Steel-types such as Klefki and Registeel are inconsistent at beating it one-on-one. While offensive Tsareena profiles as a solid wallbreaker that can take over games thanks to Rapid Spin's Speed boost, defensive sets are fantastic at checking the swathes of offensive Ground-types in NU, especially Krookodile and Flygon, and its access to Synthesis is a huge factor in it outclassing Brambleghast, its primary competition. Tsareena faces some very real struggles defensively, though, as almost every Ground-type it aims to check carries super effective coverage, like Gunk Shot from Krookodile and Megahorn from Rhyperior, that threatens to KO it with minimal chip damage required. Offensive sets aren't very fast without a Speed boost and easily pressured by other wallbreakers like Chandelure and Munkidori as well as fast utility options in Noivern and Talonflame. Meanwhile, defensive sets are quite easy to exploit due to their reliance on Knock Off with Pokemon like RestTalk Alolan Muk, Vileplume, and Dragalge. Tsareena doubles as a source of entry hazard removal and a potent wallbreaker. Knock Off punishes switch-ins such as Talonflame and Magnezone while obliterating Chandelure, and Triple Axel deletes opposing Grass-types like Vileplume, Venusaur, and Rotom-C as well as Noivern. If you wish to tap further into Tsareena's utility movepool, U-turn is optional over Triple Axel, still giving it an out against any of its checks while enabling its stronger teammates. High Jump Kick is another coverage move you can try, as it's Tsareena's best option for hitting Steel-type hazard setters like Copperajah and Registeel and does good damage to Incineroar. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Tsareena bypass hazard damage, which increases its proficiency as a spinner, but Lum Berry helps against Talonflame's Flame Body and Slowbro's Scald. Tsareena usually shouldn't be Terastallizing, but Tera Dragon potentially lets it KO a Chandelure or Hisuian Typhlosion with Knock Off and gives Tsareena a good sun matchup, while Tera Steel blanks Munkidori's STAB moves, potentially lets Tsareena beat Cloyster, and helps it against Alolan Muk. Tsareena is great at luring in and beating certain Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Venusaur with Triple Axel; make sure to pair it with teammates like Mienshao, Thundurus, and Sylveon that can take advantage of this. Furthermore, Mienshao especially, as well as other physical attackers like Gallade and Infernape, appreciate Tsareena removing Talonflame's Heavy-Duty Boots and making it easier to overwhelm with Stealth Rock up. Similarly, teammates like Choice Specs Noivern, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion all appreciate Tsareena's Rapid Spin, and the latter two can beat Steel-type checks like Klefki, Registeel, and Magnezone for Tsareena. Talonflame is perhaps the most common switch-in to Tsareena, so Pokemon like Diancie and Slowbro that easily switch into it are helpful to have. Bulky Tsareena is one of the tier's few good answers to the plethora of offensive Ground-types in NU, such as Flygon, Krookodile, and Rhyperior. Although they possess super effective coverage moves for it, they can't OHKO it, and Synthesis keeps Tsareena healthy throughout the game so it can stay out of KO range from these threats. The biggest boon to this set, though, is destroying Klefki; it can't do enough damage with Foul Play thanks to the bulk investment, and Power Whip or Trop Kick will slowly beat it down. Trop Kick can be used over Power Whip for its accuracy, but you lose out on useful damage rolls like 2HKOing Diancie, 2HKOing Assault Vest Reuniclus after Stealth Rock, and OHKOing Krookodile. The Speed EVs ensure Tsareena outspeeds Modest Diancie before it can attack with Meteor Beam, but Tsareena can go even faster if it wants, with relevant targets including Modest Magnezone, Torterra, and Adamant Feraligatr. Tsareena will rarely want to Terastallize, but Tera Poison is nice to consistently answer Fighting-types like Mienshao and non-Meteor Mash Lucario and makes Tsareena immune to poison from Alolan Muk at the cost of becoming weak to Earthquake; Tera Dragon aids against Fire-types like Hisuian Typhlosion and retains several resistances to types like Water, Grass, and Electric; and Tera Steel is useful for checking Fairy- and Poison-types such as Sylveon and Munkidori as well as Cloyster. Tsareena creates great defensive cores with common entry hazard setters like Diancie and Rhyperior. They resist Fire and Flying for Tsareena, while it takes on Water- and Ground-type attacks in return. Its Knock Off support is also favored by many offensive Pokemon, specifically Fighting-types like Mienshao, Gallade, and Infernape, since Tsareena so frequently draws in Talonflame and removes its Heavy-Duty Boots. Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Choice Specs Chandelure, Choice Specs Noivern, and itemless Thundurus also desire Tsareena for its Rapid Spin. Tsareena has other usable Tera types than the ones listed, but they lack consistency across teams. Tera Dark is good for teams that lack a Ghost resistance and amps up Knock Off's damage, but it offers little else. Tera Ghost is a harder answer to Fighting-types than Tera Poison, but it's just as bad into Krookodile and gives Tsareena a horrible Alolan Muk matchup. Tera Fire is similar to Tera Dragon in helping Tsareena against Fire-types, although Tsareena gains a Water weakness. Choice Scarf sets are good at revenge killing priority-reliant setup sweepers like Lycanroc-D and Lucario and don't have to worry about Klefki's Thunder Wave. Flying-types: All of Talonflame, Noivern, and Acrobatics Thundurus outspeed Tsareena and beat it with relative ease. Talonflame hates losing its item, though, and both Noivern and Thundurus are vulnerable to Triple Axel from offensive sets. Poison-types: Alolan Muk is a great Tsareena answer, especially if it's RestTalk. Other Poison-types like Dragalge, Vileplume, and Munkidori are good checks but less consistent. The former two cannot survive Knock Off followed by Triple Axel, while the latter is too frail to take Knock Off from either Tsareena set. Fire-types: Incineroar counters Tsareena with ease, only fearing the rare High Jump Kick. Although Knock Off obliterates Chandelure and Hisuian Typhlosion, they both can spinblock Tsareena, tank its Power Whip, and OHKO it with their Fire-type attacks barring a well-timed Terastallization."

  "Typhlosion": {
    "name": "Typhlosion",
    "text": "Choice Specs Typhlosion is an insanely powerful special attacker in a tier without much in the way of sturdy Fire-resistant Pokemon. Much of its power comes from its move Eruption, which has unparalleled strength with Typhlosion at full health and can OHKO most neutral targets such as Mesprit and Passimian. With Typhlosion's Speed tier, it outspeeds much of the unboosted metagame, meaning that it can frequently come in and pick up KOs. However, Choice Specs Typhlosion struggles against faster Pokemon such as Grafaiai and Choice Scarf users like Passimian that can damage it before it moves and limit its power; it's also checked by the few Pokemon that can take on its Eruption reliably such as Snorlax and Cramorant, necessitating a team to have good answers to them such as Regirock and Articuno, respectively. On the other hand, the Choice Scarf set misses some OHKOs such as against Mesprit and Palossand, but it outspeeds common Choice Scarf users like Rotom and Passimian and fast attackers like Sneasel and Jolteon. Typhlosion's Eruption is limited by Stealth Rock as well as other damaging entry hazards, meaning it requires hazard removal support from the likes of Cramorant and Hisuian Decidueye. Eruption is Typhlosion main STAB attack, dealing insane damage at full health, even being able to 2HKO Fire-resistant Pokemon like Regirock and Appletun with the help of Tera Fire. Fire Blast and Flamethrower are to be used when Typhlosion gets weakened; both options are valid and come down to personal preference between power and accuracy. Fire Blast namely gives better odds to OHKO threats such as Sandslash and Passimian. Focus Blast gives Typhlosion a chance to 2HKO Snorlax, which can easily take Fire-type attacks, as well as being its strongest move against Rock-types like Regirock and Rhydon. Scorching Sands targets Fire-types such as opposing Typhlosion and Pyroar as well as some bulky Water-types like Lanturn and Qwilfish, and it is a more accurate option to threaten Rock-types. Flash Fire lets Typhlosion switch into powerful Fire-type attacks without losing power on Eruption, but this leaves it vulnerable to Trace Porygon2. Blaze boosts Typhlosion's secondary Fire-type STAB attack to insane levels in late-game scenarios, becoming about as strong as full-power Eruption. As a powerful wallbreaker, Typhlosion naturally benefits special cleaners such as Jolteon and Oricorio-G that appreciate special walls getting weakened. If opting for Flash Fire, its immunity to Fire-type moves makes it a great teammate for Fire-weak Pokemon such as Glastrier and Hisuian Decidueye. Typhlosion appreciates VoltTurn support that can force in walls to get nuked by it, such as Articuno, Lanturn, Qwilfish, and Mesprit as well as the aforementioned Jolteon and Hisuian Decidueye. Typhlosion has trouble breaking through Fire-resistant Pokemon, including Snorlax, Cramorant, and Appletun, which makes counters to these threats such as Orthworm and Articuno attractive. Entry hazard removal is also appreciated from Pokemon such as Sandslash and Hitmonlee to keep Typhlosion at full health as long as possible. Healing Wish Pokemon like Shaymin and Mesprit can give Typhlosion a second chance at full health Eruptions later in the match. Defensive pivots that can take on revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Passimian and Floatzel, like Palossand and Qwilfish, respectively, make for great partners."

  "Tyranitar": {
    "name": "Tyranitar",
    "text": "Tyranitar's unique typing alongside fantastic special bulk under sand allows it to check dangerous threats like Latios and Zapdos well. Tyranitar's ability to remove items with a strong Knock Off and pressure entry hazard removers like Mandibuzz and Excadrill from switching in safely make it an effective Stealth Rock setter. Thunder Wave allows Tyranitar to punish switch-ins like Keldeo, Tinkaton, and Cobalion. It can also be used to cripple Tera Steel Latios to help other teammates deal with them better. Earthquake can be used to do heavy damage to Tinkaton, Excadrill, and Cobalion, but without Attack investment, it does not threaten much else. Ice Punch is an option if Tyranitar is paired with Excadrill to lure in and remove a weakened Hydrapple to help it sweep more easily. Leftovers is the preferred item choice to provide Tyranitar with passive recovery. Smooth Rock can be used to provide Sand Rush Excadrill with more sand turns but is far from necessary. Heavy-Duty Boots can help offset entry hazard damage. Chople Berry is a situational item that allows Tyranitar to check Nasty Plot Tornadus-T and Aura Sphere Latios. The given Speed EVs allow Tyranitar to outpace Skeledirge and hit it hard before potentially being punished by Will-O-Wisp. Tera Fairy removes Tyranitar's glaring weaknesses, particularly to Fighting, allowing it to punish Pokemon like Mienshao. It also allows Tyranitar to deal with a boosted Draco Meteor from Latios and KO it back while improving its matchup against Lokix. Tera Ghost can be used for a similar reason to remove Tyranitar's weaknesses while also potentially preventing Excadrill from being able to remove its Stealth Rock. Tera Water is another option to improve the matchup into Greninja and Choice-locked Keldeo; however, under sand, Tyranitar can take a boosted Surf from them anyway. Tera on Tyranitar should be used in emergencies, as removing its Rock typing takes away the boost to its Special Defense under sand and causes it to take damage from sand as well. Tyranitar fits best on offensive structures that can force progress, as it is susceptible to being worn down quickly. Excadrill is a great partner that can remove entry hazards for Tyranitar, as well as capitalize on the sand with Sand Rush to turn it into a deadly cleaner. Tinkaton pairs nicely with Tyranitar to act as a secondary check to Latios and Tornadus-T, as both are capable of chipping away at Tyranitar or potentially KOing it with Fighting-type coverage. Tinkaton also helps against other threatening wallbreakers like Ogerpon formes and Lokix; pickpocket Tinkaton variants are able to steal their Heavy-Duty Boots, causing them to slowly get whittled down by Tyranitar's Stealth Rock and sand. Other U-turn punishers like Rocky Helmet Cobalion and Zapdos can also support Tyranitar well. Slowking and Tornadus-T can help deal with Cobalion and Keldeo. Tornadus-T can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Zapdos, allowing Tyranitar to get meaningful damage on it with Stealth Rock throughout a battle. Toxapex and Hydrapple do not mind having their item removed thanks to Regenerator, so partners like Zapdos and Mamoswine can help threaten them. Choice Band Tyranitar is one of the strongest wallbreakers in the tier, with its massive Attack stat, strong spammable STAB combination that hits key threats such as Latios, Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Slowking, and coverage moves to hit its counterplay. It can also leverage its great natural bulk, especially when combined with its Special Defense boost from sand, to defensively answer special attackers like Zapdos and Latios. Earthquake pairs with Stone Edge very well for near-perfect coverage, hitting many Steel-types that would otherwise take Tyranitar's moves solidly, including Tinkaton and Cobalion. Ice Punch is solely used to OHKO Hydrapple. Tera Dark can boost the sheer strength of Tyranitar's Knock Off, 2HKOing itemless Toxapex and doing greater damage to walls like Hippowdon and Rhyperior. It also lets it avoid super effective hits, such as Greninja's Surf and Hydro Pump and Excadrill's STAB moves, and KO back. However, it leaves it vulnerable to its own sand chip and voids the Special Defense boost from sand. Tera Rock can similarly boost the power of its Stone Edge, letting it 2HKO maximum Defense Hydrapple, which is otherwise its most common switch-in. This also allows it to keep the sand Special Defense boost and avoid the chip damage so it can take on the attacks of Latios and Zapdos more easily. Tera Flying can be used to obtain a resistance and immunity to Fighting- and Ground-type moves, respectively, from offensive checks such as Excadrill, Cobalion, and Mienshao, but gaining a weakness to Stealth Rock can be costly. Tyranitar often appreciates slow pivots to help it enter safely, as it does not have any form of recovery and thus does not like taking many attacks. Slowking does so and offers Future Sight support to help Tyranitar break through some of its checks, such as Okidogi and Toxapex, more easily. It can also help defensively check foes like Cobalion and Keldeo and offers paralysis to let Tyranitar outspeed foes such as Tornadus-T and Latios. Another good partner for Tyranitar is Excadrill, which, even with the limited sand turns, can revenge kill fast threats that may threaten out Tyranitar with OHKOs, such as Keldeo and Cobalion. Excadrill also helps wear down their shared checks in Rhyperior and Hydrapple, and Rapid Spin can allow Tyranitar to live longer and break more due to it no longer taking entry hazard chip damage. Hazard setters can provide support to chip defensive Pokemon like Hydrapple, Hippowdon, and Rhyperior into KO range from Tyranitar's attacks, while Tyranitar can remove the Heavy-Duty Boots that these Pokemon use to avoid hazard damage. Cobalion also helps defensively check revenge killers to Tyranitar like Lokix and both Ogerpon formes while providing the ability to pivot on foes, namely Slowking. Sandy Shocks can offensively check potential Tyranitar switch-ins or revenge killers like Okidogi and Tinkaton and can act as an alternative Zapdos check while blocking Volt Switch. Zapdos can check Tornadus-T, pivot Tyranitar in, and check Ogerpon and Lokix that check Tyranitar. Static paralysis can allow Tyranitar to outspeed would-be faster threats and deal great damage. Tornadus-T can be a great partner for Tyranitar, checking many threats that it may let in and forcing switches of its own, which can let it bring in Tyranitar to wreak havoc. Its Flying typing and solid special bulk with Regenerator can allow it to check Cobalion and Greninja while assisting Tyranitar with checking Latios. Ogerpon and Hydrapple can work well alongside Tyranitar, checking Water-type threats such as Greninja and Azumarill that Tyranitar lets in. Scizor and Lokix can help revenge kill or pressure strong threats to Tyranitar such as Ogerpon, Greninja, Tinkaton, and Hydrapple. They can also remove potential Air Balloons from Tinkaton and Cobalion to make them vulnerable to Tyranitar's Earthquake."

  "Ursaluna": {
    "name": "Ursaluna",
    "text": "Ursaluna's nigh-unparalleled offensive prowess makes it one of the most brutal wallbreakers in the tier. The combination of Guts and STAB Facade off of Ursaluna's gargantuan Attack stat is alarming for many bulky teams, with even the most physically bulky Pokemon such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu getting 2HKOed unboosted. Ursaluna's offensive presence is further pushed by its good offensive typing, having unresisted coverage and making the likes of Garganacl and Heatran fearful of Ursaluna. Swords Dance further bolsters this offensive profile, letting Ursaluna take better advantage of the switches it often forces. The power boost lets Ursaluna land OHKOs on common Pokemon such as Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T. Fire Punch targets Steel-types immune to Ground like Air Balloon Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Skarmory that would otherwise check Ursaluna. Flame Orb triggers Guts and makes Ursaluna an adept status absorber thanks to its solid natural bulk and ability to threaten status spreaders like Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Zapdos. Tera Normal boosts Ursaluna's Facade to ungodly levels; it can overwhelm even the most bulky of physical walls like Dondozo and can OHKO the likes of Zapdos, Moltres, and Gliscor after minor chip damage. Tera Ghost gives Ursaluna immunity to Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Ursaluna's natural bulk also opens it up to being versatile at taking advantage of Terastallization, as it can often afford to take neutral hits from powerful threats such as Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake after Terastallizing into types like Fairy or Grass and launch a counterattack in return. While an Adamant nature with maximum Speed investment is generally preferred for outspeeding the likes of Kingambit and Corviknight, a Brave nature, combined with maximum investment in HP and Attack, turns Ursaluna into a monstrous threat on Trick Room teams. Even outside of Trick Room teams, this variant can function as a powerful and bulky wallbreaker, taking advantage of Pokemon such as Iron Moth and Zapdos to switch in and wreak havoc. Ursaluna fits on many bulky offense teams as a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazard support from Glimmora and Gliscor provides chip damage to help Ursaluna further overwhelm defensive Pokemon. Landorus-T, in addition to being an entry hazard setter, is an amazing pivot thanks to Intimidate giving Ursaluna more ease coming into battle. Fast offensive Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Weavile, and Dragapult appreciate Ursaluna knocking out defensive Pokemon such as Gliscor, Dondozo, and Clefable, respectively. In return, they can help clean late-game against faster-paced offensive teams. Ursaluna tends to struggle against common offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Kyurem that can outspeed and threaten Ursaluna. Offensive Pokemon that can handle these threats, namely Gholdengo, Zamazenta, and Kingambit, make for strong teammates. These Pokemon heavily appreciate Ursaluna threatening defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Priority users such as Dragonite and Scizor appreciate Ursaluna's strong wallbreaking abilities that let them have an easier time cleaning late-game while also providing utility against faster offensive Pokemon. Defensive pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Alomomola do wonders in terms of letting Ursaluna switch in on offensive Pokemon thanks to their low Speed and Chilly Reception and Flip Turn, respectively, ensuring Ursaluna enters the field with as minimal damage taken as possible. The former is a great check to Pokemon that can beat Ursaluna, while the latter can help Ursaluna's longevity with Wish. On more aggressive teams, Alolan Ninetales can provide Aurora Veil support, boosting Ursaluna's already solid bulk and letting it more easily set up Swords Dance against bulkier foes. Ursaluna, with minimum Speed investment, is a hugely important aspect of Trick Room teams, often acting as the premier offensive threat on said teams. Hatterene is a natural choice for a Trick Room setter thanks to Magic Bounce letting it block Taunt, as well as entry hazards that would otherwise further compromise Ursaluna's bulk."

  "Ursaring": {
    "name": "Ursaring",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 6 onwards Price Range: 5-6 points Overview: Ursaring is a uniquely strong and flexible low-tier Pokemon due to its combination of incredible Eviolite-boosted bulk and natural strength. It can be used to check nearly any Pokemon in the meta, as it easily endures non-Fighting-type attacks and possesses wide coverage to pair with its high Attack. Ursaring can also leverage its power and bulk to serve as a capable sweeper or use Guts or Quick Feet to become a strong wallbreaking option. Despite all of these strengths, minimal utility, a lack of reliable recovery, and its Normal typing generally being a luxury cause Ursaring to be a budget pick. Eviolite Wall: Ursaring can use its sheer bulk to serve as either a physical or special wall to check nearly any particular foe. It can tailor its coverage to the Pokemon it is aiming to check and threaten the rest of the opposing team enough, as it still has quite naturally high Attack. These sets can also serve as an effective status spreader, as Body Slam is almost always the STAB attack of choice, and Yawn is often used to force switches or inflict sleep. Ursaring's lack of reliable recovery frequently forces you to choose whether it may bring its utility options or if it would like Rest and Sleep Talk to try and stick around. Wallbreaker: Ursaring can focus more on its brute strength to weaken opposing teams for late-game cleaners and sweepers. These sets often forgo Eviolite for a Flame Orb or Toxic Orb to activate one of its abilities, making it incredibly powerful or surprisingly fast while boosting a strong STAB Facade. In some circumstances, these sets can employ the use of setup with Swords Dance as well to become even more threatening. Bulky Setup Sweeper: Ursaring can use Eviolite and Bulk Up to become a strong threat that is difficult to remove. These sets often use Rest and Sleep Talk for longevity and choose one attack from its excellent coverage pool that can hit the entire opposing team. Primary STAB Moves: Body Slam, Facade, Double-Edge Setup Moves: Bulk Up, Swords Dance, Trailblaze Utility Moves: Yawn, Rest, Sleep Talk, Taunt, Brick Break Coverage: Earthquake, Close Combat, Gunk Shot, Low Kick, Play Rough, Ice Punch, Fire Punch, Crunch, Throat Chop, Payback, Thunder Punch, Seed Bomb, Avalanche, Stone Edge, Rock Slide, Shadow Claw Counter: Ursaring can use its physical bulk to survive nearly any one hit and trade with a foe through the use of Counter. High Horsepower: Although Earthquake is almost strictly better, High Horsepower has a niche when used in Grassy Terrain. Rock Tomb / Bulldoze: Rock Tomb and Bulldoze can be used as speed control options to prevent a foe from getting out of hand. Charm / Baby-Doll Eyes: Ursaring can use either of Charm or Baby-Doll Eyes to weaken a threatening physical foe. Although Charm is more impactful, Baby-Doll Eyes can allow it to go before the foe and lower its Attack, which can be invaluable against sweepers in a pinch. Eviolite: The absolute go-to item on Ursaring, Eviolite provides immense value on both offensive and defensive sets, as Eviolite boosts its bulk tremendously at no cost. Flame Orb / Toxic Orb: Flame Orb and Toxic Orb are seen on more offensive wallbreaking sets to activate Ursaring's abilities. Flame Orb is typically seen on Guts sets that aim for immediate power, whereas Toxic Orb is used on Quick Feet sets to get a jump on foes with 106 Speed or lower while not halving its own Attack. Anything Else: Stop and reflect on how this possibly outclasses Eviolite or self-status infliction. Ursaring is often drafted as a secondary Tera Captain, as it usually fits seamlessly with higher-tier Tera Captains that are reliant on the mechanic. Most commonly, it uses a solid defensive Tera type such as Tera Fairy, Poison, or Ghost to flip its weakness a Normal to further its wallbreaking on Guts sets to make Facade unstoppable. Ursaring ultimately never needs to Terastallize, which makes it a good secondary Captain, but it is often an excellent back pocket option to beat a specific foe or allow for a sweep. Ursaring fits on nearly any draft, as Normal-types are not incredibly common, so it should provide a unique typing as well as the fact it only brings one weakness to the table. However, it should only be drafted on teams that have their role compression sorted out, as it lack typical utility one looks for. Overall, Ursaring can provide a unique combination of defense as well as wallbreaking that is a nice luxury to have when logical and affordable. Knock Off Absorbers: Ursaring is incredibly item-reliant, as Eviolite facilitates all of its roles as bulky attacker. As a result, having its Eviolite removed is incredibly harmful to its longevity, especially as it lacks reliable recovery. Pokemon that switch into Knock Off consistently such as Ting Lu, Gliscor, and Cobalion help Ursaring hold onto its bulk. Fighting-type Checks: Ursaring functions as such a good blanket check partly because it only has one weakness. Having reliable switch-ins to the Fighting-type foes that force it out like Galarian Slowking, Uxie, and Zapdos help keep the bear safe. Entry Hazard Removal: As Ursaring is essentially item locked out of Heavy-Duty Boots, reliable entry hazard removers are ideal to keep it from taking too much chip damage. Hazard removers like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Quaquaval serve as consistent enough hazard control to keep it healthier. Utility Options: Ursaring is devoid of common roles such as pivoting, entry hazard setting, and item removal that are key to successful teams. Versatile utility Pokemon like Landorus-T, Hisuian Samurott, and Tinkaton fit well with it to cover these missing necessities. Status-weak Teammates: Due to Guts, Ursaring can switch in on status moves to shield its teammates and buff its Attack stat. In particular, it can be very solid at dissuading opposing Toxic Spikes, despite if its teammates are weak to them. These capabilities benefit most offensive teammates like Iron Valiant, Urshifu-S, and Ogerpon-W. Entry Hazards: As Ursaring has next to no item flexibility and does not ever employ Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazards are an easy way to wear it down. This is especially the case as it lacks reliable recovery and is often used as a status absorber, so the chip damage can accumulate quickly, and its ability to check foes multiple times evaporates. Ghost-types: Ursaring only has STAB on Normal-type moves, and with its Ghost-type coverage being relatively weak, it can struggle to break some of these enemies. Foes such as Annihilape, Gholdengo, and Sinistcha can be excellent checks to it and are difficult for it to remove. Rocky Helmet: Ursaring can suffer greatly from facing bulky Pokemon with a Rocky Helmet, as it almost exclusively attacks while making contact. This is impactful in particular due to its lack of reliable recovery. Faster Foes: Although it has impressive stats across the board for bulk and its Attack, Ursaring lacks Speed, greatly allowing most foes to hit it first. Anything with mediocre Speed or better can disrupt it or hit it as strong as they can, which in many instances is a hindrance."

Compared to other physically bulky Water-types like Swampert and Quagsire, Vaporeon excels due to its access to reliable recovery in Wish and its ability to pivot and potentially pass Wish to its teammates with Flip Turn. Vaporeon can also run Haze, which allows it to check bulky setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Iron Defense Registeel. However, more powerful or more aggressively boosting foes, such as Swords Dance Mienshao and Nasty Plot Munkidori, can overwhelm Vaporeon. Additionally, while Vaporeon can be a great blanket check to certain physical and special attackers, it can be easily overwhelmed at times by either how many it has to check in a battle or their sheer power. Grass- and Electric-type attackers, such as Poison Heal Breloom, Brambleghast, and Kilowattrel, are quite common as well and easily force Vaporeon out. Flip Turn allows Vaporeon to pivot in teammates for free and more easily pass Wish. Alternatively, Haze gives Vaporeon an option to prevent opposing setup sweepers like Calm Mind Cresselia and Iron Defense Registeel from boosting out of control. Leftovers gives Vaporeon additional healing, particularly in combination with Protect to gain free turns to heal. However, Heavy-Duty Boots allows Vaporeon to pivot more frequently without concern for entry hazard chip damage. Tera Poison gives Vaporeon a resistance to Fighting- and Grass-type attacks from common physical attackers such as Mienshao, Breloom, and Brambleghast, as well as an immunity to being poisoned by Umbreon's Toxic. Tera Dark, on the other hand, allows Vaporeon to temporarily check Stored Power sweepers like Bronzong and Cresselia if it doesn't have Haze, as well as Choice Band Tera Blast Ghost Basculegion, which would 2HKO it otherwise. Vaporeon benefits from teammates that can take powerful special attacks from foes like Chandelure, Porygon-Z, and Munkidori, so special walls like Incineroar, Bronzong, and Assault Vest Alolan Muk support it well. These teammates also benefit from Wish being passed to them, as they lack reliable recovery. A backup physical wall such as Sylveon or Vileplume is useful to ensure Vaporeon isn't overwhelmed by Ground- and Fighting-types like Flygon and Mienshao. On non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets, entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Talonflame, Tsareena, and Brambleghast is vital to ensure Vaporeon doesn't become excessively passive by being forced to heal each time it comes out. Powerful wallbreakers such as Mienshao, Flygon, and Chandelure benefit from Wish and Flip Turn support from Vaporeon, allowing them to repeatedly switch in and break opposing walls. As an alternative to Haze, Vaporeon can utilize Roar to phaze opposing setup sweepers. Calm Mind can be used on Vaporeon to let it take advantage of forced switches and passive Pokemon, usually alongside Ice Beam to make progress against Toxicroak and Grass-types like Vileplume. However, this set is still walled by opposing Water-types. Tera Fairy can be used to resist Fighting- and Dragon-type attacks, and Tera Ghost can be used to completely wall Paldean Tauros-W. Grass-types: Vaporeon is weak to common Grass-type attackers such as Brambleghast, Technician Breloom, and Tsareena. However, all of these hate switching into a Scald burn. Grass-type coverage, like Chandelure's Energy Ball and Tera Grass Paldean Tauros-F's Trailblaze, can also be threatening. Electric-types: Electric-type attackers like Kilowattrel and Iron Thorns force Vaporeon out, and they can take advantage of this by gaining momentum or setting up. Special Attackers: Strong special attackers, such as Porygon-Z, Chandelure, and Dragalge, scare out Vaporeon, and the first two have Trick to cripple it. Water-immune Pokemon: As Vaporeon only runs Water-type attacks, it cannot actually damage opposing Water-immune Pokemon. Most prominently, Toxicroak can set up on Vaporeon or throw out powerful attacks, Gastrodon can set hazards, and opposing Vaporeon are untouchable."

    "text": "Venomicon's great typing, solid defensive stats, and powerful ability in Stamina make it one of the metagame's premiere defensive Pokemon. Sludge Bomb allows Venomicon to check Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin, Iron Valiant, and Cresceidon and poison potential switch-ins such as Zapdos and Dragapult. However, Hurricane can help check Fighting-types such as Revenankh and Arghonaut while also hitting Chuggalong neutrally. Body Press hits Steel-types such as Equilibra and Kingambit while also synergizing greatly with Stamina. Stealth Rock is a fantastic choice for the last slot, allowing Venomicon to compress roles within itself even further. That being said, Knock Off is an alternative, should Stealth Rock already be present on another team member. 152 Defense EVs allow Venomicon to OHKO Speed Booster Energy Roaring Moon with Body Press after Stealth Rock damage, with the rest going into Special Defense to cover its weaker defensive stat. Tera Water allows Venomicon to check sun teams, have an easier time versus Heatran, tanks an Ice Beam from Kyurem, and helps Venomicon tank Doom Desire for its teammates. Tera Dragon also helps Venomicon check sun teams and allows it to handle Ogerpon-W. Tera Fighting deserve a mention mainly to nail Kingambit with Body Press, and it also provides a valuable resistance to Stealth Rock, which can be useful should Venomicon lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Steel-types such as Equilibra and Kingambit appreciate Venomicon's ability to shut down Fighting- and Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Landorus-T. In return, they check Gholdengo and Kitsunoh, which can take anything Venomicon throws at them, and Equilibra can provide entry hazard removal should Venomicon lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Psychic-types such as Deoxys-S and Galarian Slowking can be a pain as well, so Dark-types like Darkrai and Kingambit can be effective at threatening them and absorbing Future Sight. Knock Off absorbers such as Ogerpon-W and Gliscor are fantastic partners because Venomicon wants to keep its Heavy-Duty Boots for as long as possible. Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Raging Bolt appreciate Venomicon's ability to take on Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin and Cresceidon. Nasty Plot Venomicon takes advantage of its fantastic typing, ability, and Special Attack stat to easily set up and threaten foes such as Rillaboom, Revenankh, and Great Tusk with Hurricane. Sludge Bomb can be used instead to nail Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin and Cresceidon and pressure Venomicon's checks through poison damage. Body Press gets boosted by every hit that lands on Venomicon thanks to Stamina and pairs extremely well with Hurricane and Sludge Bomb, nailing Steel-types such as Kingambit and Equilibra. Tera Water gives Venomicon the ability to check sun teams, beat Heatran one-on-one more easily, tank an Ice Beam from Kyurem, though it still fears Freeze-Dry, and tank Doom Desire for its teammates. Tera Dragon also lets Venomicon check sun teams, but it also grants it the strength to handle Ogerpon-W. Tera Fighting mainly nails Kingambit with Body Press, but it also provides an important resistance to Stealth Rock, which can be helpful should Venomicon lose its Heavy-Duty Boots. Nasty Plot Venomicon fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive benefits and ability to act as a late-game sweeper. As a result, Venomicon benefits from having more offensive partners, such as Weavile and Dragapult, that help apply pressure to foes. Ogerpon-W and Great Tusk help ease the matchup against Steel-types such as Equilibra and Gholdengo that Venomicon struggles with. Other good partners such as Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit that appreciate Venomicon's ability to blow open holes in the opponent's defensive core so they can clean up. Nasty Plot Venomicon suffers against faster threats such as Deoxys-S, so partners such as Cresceidon, Dragapult, and Hatterene that can spread paralysis to slow them down are great choices. Venomicon also has a hard time against Electric- and Steel-types that are immune or neutral to Body Press such as Raging Bolt and Gholdengo so Ground-types such as Equilibra and Ting-Lu are fantastic partners. Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Raging Bolt appreciate Venomicon's ability to eliminate Fairy-types such as Hemogoblin and Cresceidon. On defensive sets, U-turn can be used over Stealth Rock or Body Press to allow Venomicon to slowly pivot in frail wallbreakers such as Weavile, Miasmaw, and Deoxys-S on more offensively inclined teams. It also allows it to keep up momentum on sun teams. Tera Fairy allows Venomicon to tank a boosted Knock Off from Roaring Moon, heal off the damage with Roost, and wall Roaring Moon. Tera Steel, however, can surprise Stratagem and KO it with Body Press while also easing the pressure from opposing Future Sights and Doom Desires. Gholdengo and Kitsunoh: These two are the biggest nuisance for Venomicon, as they resist Hurricane, are immune to Sludge Bomb and Body Press, and are somewhat unbothered by Knock Off. They can both annoy Venomicon by setting up on it in Gholdengo's case or getting rid of its Heavy-Duty Boots in Kitsunoh's case. Special Walls: Special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Mollux can easily switch into Venomicon and cripple it with Thunder Wave. However, both dislike Knock Off. Garganacl also gives Venomicon trouble due to Salt Cure not only being super effective but also wearing it down over time. Psychic-types: Deoxys-S and Galarian Slowking can easily threaten Venomicon with their STAB. Iron Crown can also give Venomicon a hard time with Psychic Noise preventing Roost while also being immune to Sludge Bomb and resisting Hurricane. Electric-types: Raging Bolt and Plasmanta both not only have super effective STAB attacks against Venomicon but are bulky enough to take any unboosted hit Venomicon has to offer. Krilowatt fears Knock Off, as it would lose a good chunk of its power, but if it comes in on any other move, it threatens Venomicon out easily. Kyurem: Kyurem can threaten Venomicon out with a powerful Ice-type STAB move. However, it does have to worry about Body Press, especially if Venomicon Terastallizes. Knock Off: Venomicon weak to Stealth Rock makes losing its Heavy-Duty Boots a bad situation, as it wants to stay as healthy as possible. This means Venomicon struggles with checking Pokemon it should that can commonly carry Knock Off such as Arghonaut and Great Tusk."

Sample set. Stay tuned for updates! A Modest nature maximizes Venusaur's wallbreaking potential and makes up for Giga Drain's relatively low Base Power, but opting for a Timid nature improves its matchup against opposing sun teams.

  "Vileplume": {
    "name": "Vileplume",
    "text": "Vileplume is one of the premier physical walls in the NU tier. Its Grass / Poison typing allows it to resist common Fighting- and Water-type attacks from Mienshao, Breloom, and Basculegion. Vileplume excels in punishing foes for making contact, dealing damage with Rocky Helmet and spreading status with Effect Spore. Despite being a wall, Vileplume isn't completely passive; with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, it can threaten serious damage on Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Avalugg, and Vileplume can potentially poison foes with the latter. Leech Seed and Strength Sap further Vileplume's longevity and weaken checks like Registeel and Alolan Muk. Special wallbreakers like Dragalge, Chandelure, and Porygon-Z can easily overwhelm Vileplume. Defensive Steel-types such as Copperajah and Klefki that resist both of Vileplume's STAB moves wall it well but risk being worn down by Leech Seed. Giga Drain hits offensive Ground-types like Swampert and Flygon that resist Sludge Bomb. However, Stun Spore can be run instead for extra utility, allowing Vileplume to spread paralysis for teammates. Leech Seed allows Vileplume to make progress against special walls like Registeel, Cresselia, and Dragalge. Effect Spore and Rocky Helmet can punish U-turn pivots like Mienshao and Flygon and other contact attackers like Paldean Tauros-W and Basculegion. Leftovers can be used to keep it from being too passive and having to heal up as often. Tera Water is used to resist Fire- and Ice-type attacks in a pinch from Chandelure, Mienshao, and Inteleon; on the other hand, Tera Fairy removes its weaknesses, notably to Fire and Psychic, while improving its matchup versus Fighting-types like Mienshao, Gallade, and Infernape. Defensive Steel-types like Copperajah and Registeel wall Vileplume's STAB moves, so Fighting-types like Mienshao and Gallade and Fire-types like Chandelure and Infernape pair well with it. Vileplume also needs support from more specially defensive teammates to take on special wallbreakers like Dragalge, Chandelure, and Inteleon. Options like Registeel, Incineroar, and Milotic can resist these wallbreakers' strong special attacks. Psychic-types like Assault Vest Gallade and Cresselia and Dark-types like Brute Bonnet and Alolan Muk also support Vileplume, helping it against Psychic-type threats like Munkidori, Indeedee-F, and Gallade. Powerful Fire-types like Infernape, Incineroar, Chandelure, and Hisuian Typhlosion also pose a threat to Vileplume, so teammates like Vaporeon, Swampert, and Diancie help it handle these threats. Growth can be used over Leech Seed, allowing Vileplume to take advantage of bulkier Pokemon that can't threaten it like Alolan Muk and Brute Bonnet, but losing out on Leech Seed means Vileplume can't take on or chip away at Steel-type checks like Registeel and Klefki. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to ignore entry hazards and to decrease passivity by not needing to heal as often, but the sheer punishment of Rocky Helmet or healing of Leftovers is usually preferred. This value is often not seen long-term, as Vileplume is often tasked with taking Knock Off repeatedly. Special Wallbreakers: Special wallbreakers like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Porygon-Z can all easily beat Vileplume down with their powerful super effective and even neutral attacks. Tentacruel: Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze poses a unique threat to Vileplume, which cannot meaningfully damage it with Giga Drain or Sludge Bomb. Liquid Ooze prevents Leech Seed from healing Vileplume and threatens to OHKO Vileplume if it attempts to use Strength Sap."

  "Vivillon": {
    "name": "Vivillon",
    "text": "Vivillon is a very good support Pokemon, providing redirection and fast sleep while dealing good damage. Compound Eyes helps make Vivillon more consistent as a support Pokemon, making Hurricane and Sleep Powder more accurate. Hurricane does good damage to foes such as Amoonguss and Rillaboom as well as hitting common Tera Grass users like Archaludon, which are forced to Terastallize due to Sleep Powder. Rage Powder, even with Vivillon's low bulk, is able to soak up one or two attacks for allies such as Garchomp. Focus Sash compensates for Vivillon's rather poor defensive stats, granting more turns for it to support its team, specifically allowing for more sleep opportunities. Tera Ghost denies Fake Out from foes like Rillaboom and Incineroar and Extreme Speed from Dragonite, which helps with Vivillon's survivability, as it stops Focus Sash from being broken. Vivillon works well on offensive teams, acting as a fast sleep support Pokemon while still hitting hard into defensive pieces like Rillaboom and Amoonguss. Sleep Powder can shut down slower foes such as Annihilape and Primarina, keeping the momentum for offensive threats like Garchomp. Vivillon also works well on balance, specifically with Porygon2, redirecting or shutting down attacks for Porygon2 while also sitting next to Ursaluna as it uses Earthquake. Thanks to Vivillon's Flying typing, it can be used next to Garchomp and its easily spammable Earthquake amazingly. Earthquake also forces threats such as Archaludon to go for Tera Grass, which then opens up Vivillon to hit hard with Hurricane. Vivillon can also put foes to sleep for Garchomp, which sets it apart from other Flying-types. Gholdengo is another solid partner for Vivillon, benefiting from redirection. Vivillon loses to Maushold and Annihilape as a duo, as Annihilape threatens Vivillon after it Terastallizes, and Maushold can shut down Vivillon by outspeeding it and using Taunt. It can also struggle with Maushold and Archaludon as a duo, with Maushold this time threatening Population Bomb as well as Taunt while Archaludon can take down Vivillon with Electro Shot, Flash Cannon, and Draco Meteor. Garchomp and Gholdengo can patch up these holes; Garchomp's Earthquake hits hard into all of the aforementioned foes, while Gholdengo can do the same with Shadow Ball and Make It Rain. Garchomp also has the added benefit of Rough Skin, damaging Maushold for attacking. Vivillon's main role is to put things to sleep with high Speed, hit decently hard, and redirect attacks to protect allies. Vivillon really shines when next to Garchomp, putting slower foes likes Pelipper to sleep and redirecting attacks such as Moonblast from Primarina and Draco Meteor from Hydreigon. Vivillon can be used best in early-game situations and works really well in the lead or even in the back next to Gholdengo, spamming Sleep Powder while Gholdengo uses Make It Rain or using Rage Powder to allow Gholdengo to set up and sweep. Vivillon can also be used next to Primarina, with Hyper Voice and Sleep Powder forcing Tera Grass from foes such as Incineroar, which can then allow Vivillon to hit hard with Hurricane. Vivillon can struggle with Pokemon like Incineroar chipping it down and breaking Focus Sash, and smart pivoting into Grass-types or Safety Goggles Pokemon can make it hard for Vivillon to do its job. For this, Incineroar can work to remove Safety Goggles with Knock Off and KO Grass-types with Flare Blitz. Tera Ghost is also great at preserving Focus Sash, while Protect and good pivoting of your own can help as well."

  "Volbeat": {
    "name": "Volbeat",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Despite its horrible stats and typing, Volbeat holds a niche as a viable low-cost disruptor due to its ability, Prankster. Taking advantage of this, it can be brought to matchups where the opponent has key setup or utility Pokemon to disrupt them with Taunt, Encore, or Trick, spread paralysis with Thunder Wave, and pivot out against incoming teammates with U-turn. However, Volbeat essentially offers nothing to the team outside of utility moves, as it can't meaningfully damage opposing Pokemon or take hits. Additionally, it is often forced into predictions to make progress against teams, as Dark-types are immune to Prankster moves, and Electric- and Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave. Disruptive Pivot: Volbeat is capable of switching in on setup or utility move-reliant Pokemon, disrupting them with various utility moves, and then pivoting out with U-turn. It doesn't usually run attacking moves beyond U-turn due to its poor offensive stats, although it can sometimes exploit a 4x weakness against the right foe. Primary STAB Moves: U-turn, Lunge Setup Moves: Don't run Tail Glow. Utility Moves: Thunder Wave, Encore, Taunt, Trick, Roost, Tailwind, Light Screen Coverage: Seismic Toss Endeavor: Although it has poor bulk, Volbeat can typically survive a neutral hit from most foes. Taking advantage of this, it can use Endeavor to weaken the foe and then paralyze it on the next turn with Thunder Wave, leaving it easy prey for teammates. Physical Coverage: Volbeat typically doesn't run attacking moves due to its poor Attack and desire to run utility moves. However, when it needs to deal damage against the right foe, it can use physical coverage to exploit a 4x weakness; for example, it can use Ice Punch to pressure a Landorus switching in to absorb Thunder Wave. Brick Break: Brick Break can break opposing dual screens if necessary. Sunny Day / Rain Dance: As a Prankster user, Volbeat can set weather to enable teammates or disrupt opposing weather teams. This is more useful for disruption than support, however; it's difficult for it to run Heat Rock or Damp Rock over Heavy-Duty Boots due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, and its poor defensive stats and typing leave it too vulnerable to set weather more than once or twice. Heavy-Duty Boots: As a pivot that is weak to Stealth Rock, Volbeat needs Heavy-Duty Boots to enter the battlefield multiple times. Choice Band / Specs / Scarf: When running Trick, Volbeat usually carries Choice items to graciously bestow on passive foes. Choice Band is its favorite, since it boosts U-turn as a bonus, but it can run any Choice item that benefits its intended target the least, as it doesn't need the increased Speed from Choice Scarf to successfully use Trick first. Trick Items: Although more niche than Choice items, Volbeat can run various other negative effect items to give to foes with Trick. Flame Orb and Toxic Orb are particularly notable, as Volbeat can otherwise only inflict paralysis, and it doesn't care as much about getting statused as its foes might. Sitrus Berry: When Stealth Rock isn't a problem in a given matchup, Volbeat can run Sitrus Berry for a quick burst of healing at low health. It benefits from this over Leftovers because it often survives neutral attacks at below half health, and it usually doesn't remain on the field for long enough for Leftovers's recovery to be greater. Light Clay: Volbeat has access to Prankster Light Screen, but it doesn't get Reflect. If it intends to support its team with Light Screen regardless, Light Clay gives teammates a few extra turns of protection. Despite Volbeat's bad base typing, Tera is useless to it; its typing is irrelevant to its typical role, and it doesn't have the stats to take advantage of Tera offensively or defensively. Virtually any other Pokemon can benefit from Tera more, so making it a Captain only presents an opportunity cost. If Volbeat is a Tera Captain despite this, various defensive Tera types can bolster its poor bulk against specific threats. Volbeat is typically taken as a low-cost final addition to an already-complete draft. It offers nothing but disruption, so its teammates must fill all other necessary roles. However, it's otherwise easy to fit Volbeat onto a draft due to its low price. It's even resilient to sniping, as it offers an alternative in its cousin Illumise, which is almost exactly the same, lacking Taunt and having a weaker U-turn but offering Wish support instead. Entry Hazards: Volbeat forces a lot of switches with its disruptive capabilities, maximizing the effectiveness of entry hazards. Hazard setters, especially ones with Spikes like Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu, exploit this. Entry Hazard Removal: Although Volbeat typically runs Heavy-Duty Boots, it can benefit from Stealth Rock and other entry hazards being removed in case it wants to run Trick or its Heavy-Duty Boots gets removed with Knock Off. Great Tusk in particular checks the Dark- and Electric-types that frustrate Volbeat. Offensive Pokemon: Volbeat enables many setup sweepers and wallbreakers by spreading paralysis and disrupting walls. Slower, more powerful wallbreakers like Baxcalibur and Gouging Fire particularly benefit from paralysis letting them outspeed foes, but any offensive Pokemon works well. Pivots: Other pivots can let Volbeat come in as necessary against foes it wants to disrupt. It especially benefits from slow pivots like Galarian Slowking and Swampert, since it's too frail to take many hits. After disrupting foes, Volbeat can in turn pivot back to its teammates to maintain momentum. Dark-types: Dark-types are immune to Prankster moves, which presents Volbeat with a massive problem, as its main purpose is to use Prankster moves. It can threaten super effective damage against them with U-turn as it pivots out, but it's too weak to deal more than chip damage this way, especially against bulky foes like Ting-Lu and Dark-types not weak to Bug like Kingambit. This leaves it in a guessing game: will the Dark-type switch in to negate Volbeat's move, or will the current foe stay in as Volbeat ineffectually pivots out with U-turn? Electric- and Ground-types: Electric- and Ground-types present a similar problem as Dark-types, specifically preventing Volbeat from freely using Thunder Wave. However, it can at least use other disruption moves like Taunt, Encore, and Trick on them. Strong Attackers: Volbeat can sometimes struggle even against the setup sweepers it tries to check: its poor bulk often leaves it 2HKOed by neutral attacks and OHKOed by super effective coverage, leaving it unable to safely switch in on them. Knock Off: Although Volbeat typically runs Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid Stealth Rock damage, getting its item removed with Knock Off presents problems for its longevity. Similarly, if running Trick, getting its negative item removed before giving it to a foe defeats the point of the set."

  "Volcanion": {
    "name": "Volcanion",
    "text": "Volcanion is one of the most potent wallbreakers available, making use of its strong STAB moves and diverse coverage options to rip through bulkier team structures. While it does struggle with longevity and Speed, the pure strength in wallbreaking power that it can provide a team makes up for these issues, with proper teambuilding further patching up these holes. Threatening defensive tier staples like Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Amoonguss, as well as nuking more fragile options with ease, Volcanion's offensive capabilities cannot be understated. Additionally, while mainly used in an offensive manner, Volcanion can also provide an out against rain teams thanks to Water Absorb, which also allows it to be a decent switch-in to Scald users like Slowbro and Suicune. Volcanion most often runs Heavy-Duty Boots, which provides it much-needed tenure in the face of Stealth Rock and entry-hazard stacking playstyles. Although Volcanion is powerful, there is reliable counterplay against it, with options like Knock Off from Cyclizar being able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots. In addition to this, Dragon-types, most notably Salamence and Hisuian Goodra, and bulky Water-types like Gastrodon and Empoleon leverage their utility and advantaged typing against it. Through options like Body Press, Earth Power, and Sludge Bomb, Volcanion is able to more readily deal with foes that resist its primary STAB moves in Steam Eruption and Flamethrower. Body Press and Earth Power cover very common checks to Volcanion, with Body Press dealing with the omnipresent Cyclizar and Earth Power providing a way to hit opposing Volcanion for super effective damage. While Sludge Bomb is not as noticeably potent against its checks, the value of being able to fish for poison against near stonewall counters like Salamence cannot be understated. Taunt can be slotted in over one of Volcanion's offensive options to break through more defensive foes, denying the option of recovery, including, but not limited to, Slowbro's Slack Off and Empoleon's Roost; these foes are able to absorb Volcanion's attacks naturally with their bulk. Heavy-Duty Boots increases Volcanion's overall longevity in the face of a tier ruled by entry hazards. Water Absorb allows for legitimate utility that isn't usually seen with other wallbreakers, providing a valuable matchup against rain teams, denying pivoting or strong boosted Water-type STAB moves from the likes of Barraskewda, Kingdra, and Basculegion-F. Maximizing Special Attack investment and a Modest nature allows Volcanion to deal huge damage even to Pokemon that resist its attacks, and it runs enough Speed investment to outspeed Adamant Crawdaunt. The rest of the available EVs are allotted towards HP to improve Volcanion's overall bulk. Tera types are flexible on Volcanion, but generally, Ghost and Fairy are the most applicable, as they provide very sound matchups against tier staples like Slither Wing and Krookodile while also providing a neutrality to Stealth Rock. Tera Ghost denies Rapid Spin from Cyclizar, one of Volcanion's primary checks, as well as gaining an immunity to the wide array of Fighting-type moves in the tier. Fairy is a great type defensively and can deny options like Draco Meteor from Cyclizar and Salamence, forcing them to rely on more inaccurate or weaker moves in order to deal meaningful damage to Volcanion. Tera Dark can allow it to stonewall one of the best progress makers in the tier, Slowbro, by not only blocking Scald due to Water Absorb but also any of Slowbro's Psychic-type STAB options like Psyshock and Psychic Noise. Being able to also blank many of the strong Psychic-types in the tier, like Gardevoir and Armarouge, with Tera Dark is always an invaluable trait to have. Most of the time, Volcanion fits on balanced team compositions where it can take advantage of more defensive play in order to keep itself healthy throughout a match. Volcanion struggles with not having any form of reliable recovery, so it benefits from teammates that can pivot it into foes it matches up well against. Additionally, Wish passing is incredibly powerful support for Volcanion, fixing its main weakness of longevity. Jirachi is able to provide pivoting and Wish passing for Volcanion, making it a great teammate for Volcanion; it can also spread paralysis through Body Slam or Thunder Wave, providing a remedy for Volcanion's lackluster Speed. For a more offensive pivot, Galarian Zapdos serves as an option to support Volcanion's offensive presence, creating powerful synergy that can take advantage of each other's weaknesses. Galarian Zapdos is able to pivot out on its checks, primarily those that have extreme physical bulk but are vulnerable to Volcanion's strong special offense, like Hippowdon and Galarian Weezing. Inversely, Galarian Zapdos is immune to Ground-type STAB moves from threats like Krookodile, and it can also take advantage of one of Volcanion's better checks in Salamence by gaining a Defiant boost. Entry hazard stacking teams can also benefit from Volcanion, with the passive chip damage from both Stealth Rock and Spikes creating larger openings for Volcanion's wallbreaking capabilities; as such, pairing it up with Klefki, Chesnaught, or Palossand is beneficial. Volcanion can run more diverse options for its moves and items, though they can either lack power or the longevity that Heavy-Duty Boots provide. Fire Spin can be slotted over Flamethrower to trap specially defensive walls like Chansey and Milotic alongside running Taunt over an offensive option to deny their recovery. Both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf are options to turn Volcanion into a nuke or fix its below-average Speed, respectively. Its Tera types can fluctuate from the norm, slotting Tera Water for more power from Steam Eruption or Tera Ground to boost the power of Earth Power, provide an immunity to Electric, and create a more impactful synergy with Water Absorb. Tera Blast can give Volcanion an additional offensive option that can help it break through previous checks or counters, with examples like Tera Blast Fairy allowing Volcanion to break through Cyclizar and Salamence or Tera Blast Dark to deal with Slowbro and other Psychic-types. Knock Off: Volcanion doesn't appreciate the loss of Heavy-Duty Boots, which puts it in jeopardy against Stealth Rock and entry hazard stacking playstyles. Cyclizar in particular can switch in on Volcanion that lack Body Press and freely remove its Heavy-Duty Boots. Dragon-types: Dragon-types resist all of Volcanion's STAB options and can easily threaten it with powerful STAB moves of their own or take advantage of its inability to threaten substantial damage and set up on it. In particular, Cyclizar, Salamence, and Hisuian Goodra only need to dodge the potential threat of a burn if they use physical moves in order to threaten Volcanion back for serious damage. Mirror Matchups and Water-types: Without Earth Power, Volcanion gets checked well by opposing Volcanion. In a broader view, Water-types as a whole check Volcanion's STAB options well, only fearing a potential burn from Steam Eruption or Flamethrower that might hinder their future longevity. Taunt can assist with this issue, beating walls like Milotic and Empoleon in the long term by denying their recovery options, and it can provide more opportunities for Volcanion to spread burns with Steam Eruption."

    "text": "Vullaby cements itself as an elite option in LC due to its versatility, great STAB combination, and ability to check threats like Mienfoo and Gothita. Knock Off hits Vullaby's few reliable switch-ins like Pawniard, Hisuian Growlithe, and Mudbray and makes them shakier answers without Eviolite. U-turn allows Vullaby to function as a pivot and provide momentum against Pokemon like Tinkatink and Pawniard. Alternatively, Defog is an option to support its teammates that are weak to entry hazards. Weak Armor is a great ability, as it allows Vullaby to outspeed the entire metagame after one Weak Armor drop, making Vullaby more offensively potent. Tera Electric removes all of Vullaby's weaknesses, notably allowing it to resist opposing Vullaby's Brave Bird and giving it immunity to paralysis from Pokemon like Snubbull. Vullaby basically fits on every teamstyle, but it appreciates wallbreakers like Stunky and Hisuian Growlithe that can deal with its checks like Snubbull and Tinkatink. Other Pokemon with pivot moves like Mienfoo and Hisuian Voltorb can form a potent VoltTurn combination with Vullaby. Mudbray and Mienfoo appreciate Vullaby's ability to check Snivy and Foongus. In return, Mudbray and Mienfoo can switch into Pokemon Vullaby is threatened by like Pawniard, Hisuian Growlithe, and Snubbull in Mudbray's case. If Vullaby is instead running Defog, Pokemon weak to Stealth Rock such as Hisuian Growlithe and Larvesta appreciate Vullaby's ability to remove hazards to support them coming in safely."

    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1 point Overview: This adorable furball only sees serious consideration if a draft is desperate for a sun setter and if the premier options in Torkoal and Ninetales have either been already taken or out of the budget range. Aside from being able to set up the sun, Vulpix offers little else to a draft, and it rarely comes to matches. Sun Setter: Vulpix sets up the sun for its teammates to take advantage of. It can also provide support through its utility movepool with moves such as Encore and Will-O-Wisp to disrupt and cripple foes. Primary STAB Moves: Fire Blast, Overheat, Flamethrower, Weather Ball Setup Moves: Vulpix can set up the sun but not itself. Utility Moves: Will-O-Wisp, Encore, Healing Wish, Memento, Hypnosis, Roar, Pain Split Coverage: Dark Pulse, Foul Play, Energy Ball, Extrasensory, Hex Sunny Day: Against foes that can change the weather, Vulpix may benefit from being able to replenish sun duration via Sunny Day, putting on less pressure for it to switch in and out to set up the weather. Heat Rock: The go-to item for Vulpix, Heat Rock extends the duration of sun and maximises the benefits its teammates can take advantage of. Heavy-Duty Boots: As Vulpix is more vulnerable to entry hazards, Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to gain more longevity in exchange for a lesser sun duration. This requires more support so that it can continuously set up the sun for its team. Eject Pack: As Vulpix lacks pivoting options, it can use Eject Pack in conjunction with Overheat to immediately pivot to a teammate and keep up momentum. Vulpix makes the sun shine bright, but it does not shine as a Tera Captain. Do not make Vulpix your Tera Captain. Vulpix should not be drafted as a consistent sun setter. While it can boost its teammates' power through its sun-setting abilities and utility, it really only comes to a handful of games, and in some cases, other 1-point Pokemon can provide more value in fulfilling more pressing roles to complete a team. Sun-reliant Teammates: Vulpix is usually drafted alongside partners that benefit from the sun. Pokemon with Protosynthesis such as Raging Bolt, Great Tusk, and Walking Wake can drop Booster Energy for other useful items to make themselves more threatening. Chlorophyll users such as Venusaur, Hisuian Lilligant, and Victreebel also love having their Speed doubled to become potent late-game cleaners. Being Attacked: Poor defenses and HP means that Vulpix is likely to faint from most attacks in one hit. Opposing Weather Setters: Pokemon with weather-changing abilities such as Pelipper and Tyranitar can switch in safely to override the weather and threaten Vulpix out easily with their STAB combination."

  "Walking Wake": {
    "name": "Walking Wake",
    "text": "Choice Specs Walking Wake is a powerful wallbreaker and a staple on sun teams due to its unique offensive typing, amazing Special Attack, high Speed, and signature Hydro Steam, which is a powerful Water-type STAB move that takes full advantage of the sun. Draco Meteor is a brutally powerful STAB move that synergizes wonderfully with Hydro Steam, capable of OHKOing Water-resistant Pokemon including the likes of Ogerpon-W and Raging Bolt, in addition to 2HKOing nearly every Pokemon in the metagame barring Fairy-types such as Clefable and Primarina. Flamethrower guarantees an OHKO on Corviknight and bulky variants of Kingambit, though Flamethrower isn't used very often in practice due to Walking Wake's already fantastic STAB combination; Weather Ball is a stronger alternative to Flamethrower and allows Walking Wake to still take advantage of opposing weathers such as rain or snow. Dragon Pulse can be used in the last slot, which forgoes Draco Meteor's raw power for more consistency; however, Flip Turn allows Walking Wake to generate momentum for its team, taking advantage of switch-ins from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Primarina to safely bring in its teammates; lastly, Knock Off allows it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from checks such as Galarian Slowking. 244 Special Attack EVs gives Walking Wake a Speed boost from Protosynthesis, making it a potent late-game cleaner against offensive teams due to its power coupled with its heightened Speed, letting it outspeed and threaten would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus; alternatively, Walking Wake can sacrifice the Speed boost for even more power by fully investing in Special Attack, allowing it to break through the likes of Primarina through sheer strength. Tera Water boosts its Hydro Steam's power even further, bolstering its cleaning potential against offense while 2HKOing even resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and allows Walking Wake to 2HKO even Blissey should it opt for a Special Attack boost; however, Tera Fairy could be considered as an alternative, granting it an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult and opposing Walking Wake as well as a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Mystic Water is a viable alternative, allowing Walking Wake to switch up moves while still boosting its most spammable attack in Hydro Steam. Walking Wake is a mainstay on sun teams, requiring Torkoal to set the sun with Drought. Torkoal can also set Stealth Rock, which makes defensively answering Walking Wake even more difficult, as checks such as Primarina would repeatedly have to sustain chip damage. Hatterene and Great Tusk are also great teammates for Walking Wake, alleviating the issue of entry hazards limiting its longevity; Hatterene is also capable of forcing out checks such as Toxapex and Iron Valiant, while Great Tusk can check priority revenge killers such as Dragonite and Kingambit. In return, Walking Wake can consistently KO or force out either Pokemon's checks, notably taking on Skarmory for Great Tusk and Heatran for Hatterene. Choice Band Roaring Moon can pair with Walking Wake to form a devastating wallbreaking core, which can rapidly overwhelm each of their respective checks through raw power, such as Skarmory, Dondozo, Primarina, and Galarian Slowking. Walking Wake also appreciates Roaring Moon's powerful STAB Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Toxapex, and can pivot on its switch-ins with Flip Turn to bring Roaring Moon onto the field. Hisuian Lilligant and Venusaur can threaten Water-types such as Primarina and Ogerpon-W; both also appreciate Walking Wake blowing holes into the opposing team's defenses, giving them ample opportunity to run off with the game after their checks have been weakened. Lastly, Raging Bolt greatly enjoys Walking Wake's efficiency in dismantling its checks, notably Unaware Clodsire, as doing so enables Raging Bolt to sweep more efficiently in mid- or late-game scenarios."

  "Whimsicott": {
    "name": "Whimsicott",
    "text": "Blessed with the rare Fairy typing and an excellent Speed tier, Whimsicott makes for an excellent revenge killer and utility Pokemon. Whimsicott's unique typing allows it to beat many dangerous threats like Hisuian Decidueye and Virizion. A powerful Moonblast and pivoting coupled with Choice Specs allow Whimsicott to break past bulkier threats like Hisuian Qwilfish and Glastrier. However, Whimsicott's low offensive stats leave it often wanting for power, especially without Choice Specs, and it's incapable of fitting every move it wants. Furthermore, lack of reliable recovery and only average bulk makes it unable to consistently check the Pokemon it's supposed to like Regirock and Sandaconda. Choice Specs Whimsicott takes advantage of its high Speed and Moonblast to be a powerful cleaner and revenge killer. U-turn lets It scout for switches and pivot out of unfavorable matchups like Weezing and Orthworm, allowing it to bring in a more suitable teammate. Switcheroo allows Whimsicott to cripple its defensive checks, greatly hindering special walls like Dudunsparce, Orthworm, and especially Articuno, letting Whimsicott and its teammates break past them later in the game. However, Whimsicott loses a substantial amount of power without its Choice Specs, so one must be careful about when to use Switcheroo. Infiltrator allows Whimsicott to bypass Substitute from foes like Glastrier and opposing Whimsicott. Choice Specs Whimsicott best fits on balance and bulky offense teams looking for a fast offensive cleaner that also provides some defensive utility. Whimsicott loves entry-hazard stacking teammates like Qwilfish and Orthworm to help push its otherwise average damage output. It can't handle Fire-types like Charizard and Typhlosion, so answers to them like Regirock and Snorlax help immensely. Whimsicott can in return take advantage of the Grass- and Fighting-types like Hisuian Decidueye and Passimian that these Pokemon are at a disadvantage against. Whimsicott struggles with Poison-types like Weezing and Grafaiai who resist its STAB attacks and threathen it with 4x super effective attacks, so answers like Qwilfish and Sandaconda make for great teammates. Whimsicott pairs well with offensive Fire-types like Typhlosion and Charizard that handle the Steel-types like Orthworm that it has difficulties breaking past, and in return, it handles their Water and Rock-type answers such as Regirock and Lanturn. Special sweepers such as Mesprit and Oricorio-G enjoy pairing with Whimsicott for its capability to pressure and cripple special walls like Snorlax and Hisuian Qwilfish. Whimsicott leverages its superb Speed and access to Prankster to be a competent offensive pivot. Giga Drain is used for its ability to give Whimsicott staying power in longer games. Encore is key to this set, allowing it to force defensive foes into unfavorable moves like Stealth Rock and Recover, as well as shutting down setup sweepers like Oricorio-G and Snorlax by locking them into their setup moves. U-turn pairs beautifully with Encore, scouting any forced switches and allowing Whimsicott to bring in powerful teammates like Glastrier and Typhlosion. Tera Steel gives Whimsicott an immunity to Poison-type attacks from Grafaiai and Hisuian Qwilfish and a resistance to Flying-type attacks from Dodrio and Braviary as well as Ice-type attacks from Sneasel in a pinch. However, this still leaves Whimsicott vulnerable to Fire-type attacks from Charizard and Typhlosion and makes it weak to Fighting, making it unable to reliably switch into Hisuian Decidueye and Virizion. Tera Fire provides emergency resistances to Ice and Fire, but this makes Whimsicott unable to safely check Ground- and Rock-types like Sandaconda and Regirock. Balance teams enjoy Whimsicott's pivoting and Prankster Encore helping them deal with bulky defensive Pokemon and dangerous setup sweepers. Powerful physical wallbreakers like Glastrier and Passimian pair well with Whimsicott, as it baits in special walls like Articuno and can bring these teammates in with U-turn. Ground-types like Palossand and Sandaconda make for excellent partners, as Whimsicott helps them handle the Water- and Grass-types like Floatzel and Virizion that they struggle with, while they can handle Poison-types like Grafaiai that scare Whimsicott out. Fire-types like Charizard and Magmortar can easily gain entry on Whimsicott, so Fire-resistant teammates like Regirock, Rhydon, and Snorlax are helpful partners. Partners such as Charizard or Passimian that threaten Steel-types like Orthworm and Magneton can come in after a U-turn on these Steel-types to fire off attacks. Electric-types like Jolteon and Magneton appreciate Whimsicott's ability to handle Ground-types like Sandaconda, and in return, they handle the Flying-types like Dodrio and Articuno that Whimsicott struggles to beat. Other offensive pivots like Grafaiai and Floatzel can form a powerful VoltTurn core with Whimsicott, quickly racking up damage against walls like Regirock and Qwilfish, especially with entry hazards up. Psychic is an option that nails Poison-types like Weezing and Grafaiai. However, this comes at the cost of either losing U-turn's pivoting or the utility of Switcheroo or Encore. Whimsicott can use a SubSeed set to mess up its usual defensive checks like Snorlax and Orthworm and be a general nuisance. This set struggles to find setup opportunities however and relies heavily on getting a free Substitute on a forced switch. Poison-types: Whimsicott's 4x weakness to Poison and inability to hit Poison-types with its STAB attacks makes Poison-types like Grafaiai and Weezing good checks. However, these Pokemon lack reliable recovery and can thus be worn down over a game. Steel-types: Steel-types like Magneton and Orthworm can take Whimsicott's STAB attacks with ease. Orthworm can start setting entry hazards or set up with Coil or Iron Defense, while Magneton can generate momentum with Volt Switch. Fire-types: As Whimsicott's STAB attacks do little to them, Fire-types like Charizard, Typhlosion, and Magmortar can use Whimsicott as an entry point to start firing off powerful attacks. These Pokemon aren't usually defensively invested however and can struggle to switch in consistently. Special Walls: Special walls like Dudunsparce, Snorlax, and Articuno aren't bothered by Whimsicott's attacks and can use it to start forcing progress with entry hazards, status, pivoting, or boosts. However, Switcheroo completely ruins these walls, especially Articuno, and Encore can force them to repeat their status moves, allowing Whimsicott to safely bring in a teammate. Choice Scarf Users: Many common Choice Scarf users like Grafaiai, Qwilfish, and Gunk Shot Passimian get the jump on Whimsicott and can easily take it out."

  "Wo-Chien": {
    "name": "Wo-Chien",
    "text": "With its staggering Tablets of Ruin-bolstered bulk and disruptive utility options, Wo-Chien serves as a sturdy physical wall that can be difficult for teams to maneuver around. Wo-Chien's typing also provides it with multiple valuable resistances, such as Ghost, Ground, and Psychic, helping it both stave off deadly wallbreakers like Decidueye, Golurk, and Meloetta and punish opposing walls like Mudsdale and Gastrodon. On top of scouting what move Choice-locked foes like Flamigo go for, Protect maximizes the health Wo-Chien regains from Leftovers and the progress it makes with Leech Seed. Ruination consistently puts immense pressure on Pokemon looking to exploit Wo-Chien, such as Florges, Skuntank, and Coalossal, especially if they lack recovery like the latter two or have already been hit by Leech Seed. Foul Play more directly deals with physical attackers like Decidueye and Copperajah and lets Wo-Chien trade damage with setup sweepers like Zoroark and Scyther after it Terastallizes. While Heavy-Duty Boots seem appealing to protect Wo-Chien from entry hazards, especially if its team opts not to run removal, Leftovers is generally better for making Wo-Chien more durable. Tera Poison removes all of Wo-Chien's weaknesses; this notably makes it much less vulnerable to U-turn while also letting it wall the likes of Paldean Tauros-W, Skuntank, and Scrafty and punishing foes like Hoopa for using coverage. It also improves Wo-Chien's longevity by preventing it from being poisoned by moves like Bellibolt's Toxic and Gastrodon's Sludge Bomb. Wo-Chien can be tough to break after it Terastallizes, which is why it's often a team's Tera user; upon doing so, though, it becomes weak to Ground- and Psychic-type moves from foes like Golurk and Hoopa and easier to overwhelm with threats like Decidueye. Wo-Chien's massive Special Defense also makes running specially bulky sets a viable option, letting it more easily sponge attacks from Goodra and non-Sludge Bomb Toxtricity and virtually function as a mixed wall thanks to Tablets of Ruin. Balance teams benefit a lot from Wo-Chien's unique defensive profile and the amount of progress it can potentially force, all without being too bothered by its occasional passivity. Galarian Slowbro is an excellent teammate; on top of absorbing Toxic, Assault Vest variants stifle special sweepers like Florges and Salazzle, while physically defensive sets more reliably answer Fighting-types like Flamigo. Special walls, such as Florges, Gastrodon, and the aforementioned Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, keep threats like Tatsugiri, Rotom-H, and Scream Tail at bay while forming robust defensive cores with Wo-Chien. Florges can also run Wish to reduce Wo-Chien's reliance on Leech Seed for recovery, while Gastrodon and Galarian Slowbro are good at wearing down nuisances like Coalossal. Entry hazard removers like Altaria and Coalossal give Wo-Chien more opportunities to switch in and help it stay healthy without needing to play predictably. Both examples deal with physical Fire-types like Paldean Tauros-F and Arcanine, respectively, and can give Wo-Chien an easier time outlasting both physical attackers and opposing walls by spreading burns. Setup sweepers like Scrafty, Paldean Tauros-F, and Grimmsnarl pose a threat to Wo-Chien, particularly if it can't Terastallize, mandating offensive teammates that can either revenge kill them or scare them out; good examples include Choice Scarf users like Florges, Bruxish, and Flamigo and tanks like Arcanine and Assault Vest Copperajah. Sample set. Stay tuned for updates!"

  "Yanmega": {
    "name": "Yanmega",
    "text": "Yanmega is a Speed Boost setup sweeper with all of the tools necessary to break through even the sturdiest of teams. With Bug Buzz and Throat Spray, it is most threatening when it can position itself to come in and KO a weakened foe, allowing it to rack up a Special Attack and Speed boost in one turn. As one of the few offensive staples that can reliably use Protect, Yanmega is enormously difficult to revenge kill, as it can use Speed Boost to outpace even the fastest Pokemon in the metagame, like Choice Scarf users Gengar and Hisuian Zoroark and Swift Swim sweepers like Barraskewda and Basculegion-F. Using its STAB attacks isn't enough, however, as Yanmega notably struggles to break through Steel-type Pokemon like Empoleon and Hisuian Goodra, though this is circumvented by using Terastallization. Tera Ground gives Yanmega the attacking coverage to hit the entire metagame for at least neutral damage while also removing its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock damage. Without Terastallization, Yanmega struggles to break many of the defensive staples in the metagame, like Empoleon, Fezandipiti, and Jirachi. This 4x weakness does limit Yanmega significantly as a setup sweeper, though it has the bulk needed to survive most priority attacks like Aqua Jet from Barraskewda and Sucker Punch from Bisharp. Speed Boost Yanmega functions as a nearly unstoppable late-game cleaner, taking advantage of Terastallization to maximize its potency. Bug Buzz is an excellent move for Yanmega, as it activates Throat Spray, which gives an immediate boost to Special Attack while outputting damage. Tera Blast Ground is a great move for Yanmega, giving it the capacity to break through Steel-types like Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Registeel and bulky Poison-types like Fezandipiti and Slowbro. Protect gives Yanmega the ability to scout for opposing Terastallization attempts and accrue Speed boosts while also preventing Slither Wing's First Impression from taking it out post-Terastallization. Tera Ground provides Yanmega with the offensive coverage needed to hit nearly the entire metagame while also eliminating its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock damage. Tera Ground is also useful for preventing Sand Stream Hippowdon from using weather chip damage to take it out and Thunder Wave from Prankster Thundurus. Offense and hyper offense structures use Yanmega to clean games after the mid-game breakers do their part. Maushold is a notable offensive teammate for Yanmega, as it can remove entry hazards with Tidy Up. Armarouge and Thundurus are special setup sweepers that pair well with Yanmega, often forcing Steel-type Pokemon like Hisuian Goodra and Registeel to take damage during games that Yanmega can capitalize on to break through them later. Teams that use pivot options such as Mienshao and Slither Wing can take advantage of incoming physical walls like Amoonguss, Chesnaught, and Slowbro to give Yanmega the turn it needs to activate Throat Spray and accrue its first Speed boost. Cyclizar and Noivern are hazard removal options for bulkier teams that can similarly provide pivots for Yanmega. Froslass and Terrakion are excellent offensive leads that can establish hazards to chip at Pokemon that Yanmega can struggle to break, like Cyclizar and Suicune. Tera Electric allows Yanmega to KO Pokemon like Basculegion-F and Talonflame at the cost of struggling to break through Hisuian Goodra and Fezandipiti. Heavy-Duty Boots is a consideration for bulkier team structures, allowing Yanmega to enter the field multiple times while still functioning as a competent late-game cleaner. Phazing: Yanmega relies on Throat Spray to give it the Special Attack boost it needs to function as a late-game cleaner, so Pokemon like Red Card like Mimikyu can force it out and prevent it from wreaking havoc. Dragon Tail Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra and Roar Empoleon similarly force out Yanmega and, with Stealth Rock support, can prevent it from returning safely. Trace and Imposter: Choice Scarf Gardevoir is an excellent anti-offense Pokemon, notably using Trace to copy Speed Boost from Yanmega and being able to revenge kill it comfortably, as Yanmega does not threaten to OHKO it back even after a Throat Spray boost. Ditto similarly takes advantage of Yanmega's own boosts to threaten a reverse sweep against offensive structures. Stealth Rock: Yanmega struggles to enter the field, as it takes significant damage from Stealth Rock, which can be difficult for offensive structures relying on Maushold to remove against setters like Hippowdon. Pokemon like Cyclizar and Hisuian Goodra can take a hit from Yanmega and phaze it, which is enough to prevent it from coming back in, and priority users like Bisharp and Entei threaten to revenge kill it after one round of Stealth Rock damage."

    "text": "This analysis was written prior to Miraidon's ban. As such, the information provided is out of date and does not accurately reflect the current metagame. Bear with us while we rework our analyses! Zacian-C's absurd Speed, ability, and amazing typing make it one of the most dangerous physical threats in Ubers. A single Swords Dance sets it up to threaten 2HKOs on even the tier's premier physical walls such as Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM. This allows Zacian-C to take over games if left alone for even a single turn. Its Fairy / Steel typing allows it to switch into Dragon-type attacks and check even boosted Extreme Killer Arceus. Its wide selection of powerful coverage moves lets it easily check tier staples such as Arceus-Fairy, Koraidon, and Miraidon. It serves as an extraordinarily powerful wallbreaker and sweeper, able to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame save for Deoxys-A. However, while extremely powerful, Zacian-C is heavily reliant on its ability Intrepid Sword and is easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf Koraidon, one of the most common Pokemon in the tier. It also struggles to break past Necrozma-DM without lowering its own stats with Close Combat or taking recoil damage from Wild Charge, allowing it to be revenge killed by priority users such as Extreme Killer Arceus. Good positioning and threat control are required for Zacian-C to seize an opportunity and tear apart enemy teams. Wild Charge allows Zacian-C to break through Flying- and Water-types that might otherwise resist its attacks, such as Ho-Oh, Arceus-Water, Corviknight, and defensive Kyogre. Close Combat is the strongest option to damage Necrozma-DM, 2HKOing when boosted by Tera Fighting. It also allows Zacian-C to OHKO Arceus and prevent Giratina-O from using Tera Steel. Tera Flying instead allows Zacian-C to shed its Ground weakness and set up on Arceus-Ground, Groudon, and Landorus-T. Tera Fire lets it resist Koraidon's Flare Blitz and opposing Zacian-C's Behemoth Blade, while preventing burns from Sacred Fire and Will-O-Wisp. It can also Terastallize defensively to live a hit from Choice Scarf Koraidon. Zacian-C can lure threats like Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM for teammates such as Koraidon, Extreme Killer Arceus, and your own Necrozma-DM. It fits best on bulky offense teams, which use its Speed and wallbreaking ability to make progress, and hyper offense teams where its high Speed helps it against opposing offensive teams. It can swap into Koraidon's Scale Shot, but it has to be wary of Flare Blitz. Ribombee makes a fantastic partner for Zacian-C, providing much needed speed control with Sticky Web against opposing Choice Scarf Koraidon that has the added benefit of preventing Speed ties with an opposing Zacian-C. Physically defensive Pokemon such as Groudon, Skeledirge, and Landorus-T prove difficult for it to break through, so it enjoys being paired with a strong special attacker such as Miraidon or Kyogre; it also likes being paired with strong physically offensive Pokemon such as Scale Shot Koraidon, Taunt Extreme Killer Arceus, and Rayquaza, which all share the same checks and can wear them down together. Setup sweepers such as Scale Shot Koraidon, Necrozma-DM, Kyurem-B, and Arceus all benefit from Zacian-C's ability to both force foes to Terastallize and severely weaken enemy physical walls. While not as common, Zacian-C can still be valuable on slower teams, especially against Miraidon, and it serves as a potent revenge killer once its opponents have been chipped by entry hazards from teammates like Glimmora, Deoxys-A, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor. Substitute can be run over an attacking move, sacrificing Zacian-C's coverage for the ability to dodge status conditions and safely set up while being extremely effective into opposing Sticky Web teams. Unfortunately, giving up an attack greatly limits Zacian-C's offensive profile, meaning this set relies heavily on your team being able to cover the resulting bad matchups. Tera Blast can be run on double STAB sets that carry Swords Dance + Behemoth Blade + Play Rough to provide additional coverage, replacing Wild Charge. Tera Water allows Zacian-C to resist Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and 2HKO it at +3, as well as OHKOing both Ho-Oh and Tera Fire Calyrex-I, while Tera Ground instead allows Zacian-C to check Choice Scarf and Double Dance Miraidon sets and Tera Fire Pokemon such as Extreme Killer Arceus, as well as giving it a chance to outright OHKO Necrozma-DM at +3. Tera Fire can be used to survive an incoming Flare Blitz then hit Necrozma-DM or opposing Zacian-C hard with Tera Blast. This would be run in conjunction with Wild Charge and Behemoth Blade. This comes at the cost of a move slot when not Terastallized, requring Zacian-C to be the team's Terastallization user in order to be effective. Necrozma-DM: The ability to resist all of Zacian-C's standard attacks makes Necrozma-DM one of its most reliable checks. However, offensive Necrozma-DM variants are still OHKOed by a +3 Tera Fighting Close Combat. Defensive variants struggle to KO Zacian-C while being beaten by Wild Charge followed by Close Combat at +3. Choice Scarf Koraidon: Zacian-C can never outspeed Choice Scarfer users and Speed-boosting Paradox Pokemon. Choice Scarf Koraidon always guarantees an OHKO on Zacian-C with Flare Blitz unless it Terastallizes to a Fire-resistant type. Bulky Ground-types: Arceus-Ground, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Groudon can leverage their great physical bulk to survive Intrepid Sword-boosted attacks then threaten Zacian-C with super effective Ground-type attacks. Ho-Oh: Once the Intrepid Sword boost has been spent, Zacian-C struggles to break through Ho-Oh, letting it pivot into and check Zacian-C. Tera Fire Users: Tera Fire Pokemon such as Koraidon, Arceus, and Calyrex-I all take neutral damage from most of Zacian-C's attacks and can revenge kill it while threatening a sweep. Skeledirge: Unaware lets Skeledirge ignore Intrepid Sword's attack boost, allowing it to comfortably wall Zacian-C and prevent it from making progress against bulkier team compositions."

    "text": "Iron Defense Zamazenta is a fast sweeper for offense that also happens to blanket check most of the physical metagame with great matchups into key threats such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Weavile. It acts as a strong form of role compression that can make use of its great bulk, a Defense boost from Dauntless Shield, and its high Speed stat to find opportunities to use Iron Defense to not only bolster its survivability but also strengthen the power of its Body Press. Crunch is a necessity to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking that aren't threatened by Body Press, while its last moveslot is more flexible; Heavy Slam gives Zamazenta super effective coverage into Fairy-types that otherwise would wall it such as Clefable, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant, while Roar can be used to force out Pokemon that aim to beat it with Defense-boosting moves like Skarmory, Corviknight, and opposing Zamazenta as well as also turning Zamazenta into a panic check able to force out setup sweepers and Booster Energy users like Roaring Moon and Great Tusk. Substitute is an alternative that allows Zamazenta to dodge status moves from the likes of Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex along with helping to block revenge killing attempts from faster Pokemon such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Stone Edge can also be considered to give Zamazenta a non-contact option to hit Zapdos and Moltres while still giving it coverage to hit Enamorus, at the expense of losing its ability to hit other Fairy-types and the utility of Roar or Substitute. 168 EVs in Speed allow Zamazenta to outrun Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance while also outrunning key threats like Weavile and Darkrai. Zamazenta can then choose to invest EVs into HP for better overall bulk or into Attack for stronger coverage moves; notably, maximum HP investment ensures that Zamazenta will survive Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast from full while also avoiding a 2HKO from Clefable. Choosing to maximize Attack gives Zamazenta a clean 2HKO on offensive Gholdengo with Crunch and on both Clefable and Hatterene with Heavy Slam. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense to improve Zamazenta's bulk and give it a stronger Body Press. Tera Steel is one of Zamazenta's best options, defensively flipping the matchup into Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from foes like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, Deoxys-S, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon while also powering up Heavy Slam to OHKO both Enamorus and Iron Valiant even without Attack investment. Tera Steel also gives Zamazenta a crucial immunity to Toxic from Gliscor and Toxapex. Tera Fire serves to grant Zamazenta a key Fairy resistance without making it weak to Fighting-type moves from Iron Valiant, but the primary draw of this Tera type is an immunity to burn, a particularly important quality against Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Moltres, with the former and the latter able to burn even Substitute variants of Zamazenta with Infiltrator and Flame Body. Tera Fairy is another solid defensive typing for Zamazenta, granting it a great defensive profile that includes a resistance to Fighting-type attacks that helps out immensely in the Iron Defense mirror matchup against both Zamazenta and Skarmory, as well as an immunity to Dragapult's Draco Meteor and a retained resistance to Dark-type attacks that allows you to still check Weavile and Roaring Moon; Tera Ghost is an option that leans even heavier into beating opposing Iron Defense users at the expense of granting little defensive value. Zamazenta is a great fit on both bulky offense and hyper offense teams that need a fast offensive piece with good matchups into the tier's physical threats, in particular providing a crucial Kingambit check to a team. However, to be able to fully leverage its defensive value, it appreciates entry hazard removal to allow it to switch in without taking chip damage on entry and potentially being neutered entirely by Toxic Spikes. Hatterene is a particularly good partner in this regard, as it not only blocks entry hazards but can also be used to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge, and Great Tusk can clear hazards from the field along with helping to wear down Gliscor and force in and chip down Gholdengo attempting to block Rapid Spin. Rillaboom also serves as a great pairing that helps to bolster Zamazenta's longevity, with the additional healing from Grassy Terrain making Zamazenta much more difficult to remove from the field. Zamazenta's ability to check the tier's offensive Dark-types is also a valuable quality for hyper offense teams that opt to run a hazard lead like Glimmora or Deoxys-S, as these builds often use Gholdengo to block hazard removal; this will often give threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Hisuian Samurott free attacks that necessitate an offensive switch-in that Zamazenta provides. Zamazenta is then able to take advantage of these Pokemon by using them as setup fodder. Gholdengo itself is a strong partner to Zamazenta, able to switch into Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Hatterene while also taking advantage of Zamazenta's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking and Clefable being unable to touch it. Zamazenta's relatively low wallbreaking power unfortunately leaves it struggling to muscle through Unaware walls like Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, while its inability to boost the strength of its coverage moves makes bulkier Pokemon that don't fear Body Press like defensive Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking hard to break through; Zamazenta matches up best into opposing offense teams, and so balance breakers and stallbreakers are appreciated to support it in its other matchups. One strong offensive pairing with Zamazenta is Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, as it can weaken Skarmory and remove its Rocky Helmet to allow Zamazenta to later break through it. In particular, Roaring Moon's ability to chunk Dondozo and force it to take hazard damage with Knock Off is much appreciated to help Zamazenta make progress against it. Kingambit is another excellent teammate for Zamazenta, loading well into bulkier teams and heavily pressuring Dondozo while also being able to switch into Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hatterene that may come in to force Zamazenta out. A great partner to Zamazenta on hyper offensive teams is Booster Energy Iron Valiant, able to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge for Zamazenta to later break through. Iron Valiant also provides hyper offensive teams with a temporary form of speed control that can outrun Dragapult and Deoxys-S, both of which outspeed and can threaten Zamazenta with strong special attacks, or, in Dragapult's case, debilitating status with Will-O-Wisp. With an outstanding Speed tier, fantastic natural bulk and the raw power to match, all-out attacking Zamazenta is one of the tier's best natural forms of speed control and a great one-time check to some of the tier's most dominant physical threats like Kingambit and Ogerpon-W with Dauntless Shield. A powerful Close Combat is backed up by Heavy Slam to hit Fairy-types like Hatterene, Clefable, and Iron Valiant, while Crunch allows for Zamazenta to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking. Stone Edge lets Zamazenta secure a 2HKO on Tera Flying Roaring Moon and specially defensive Skeledirge, along with dealing massive damage to Moltres. Alternatively, Zamazenta can opt to run Ice Fang as its strongest move against Gliscor and Landorus-T, coming with the additional benefit of comfortably 2HKOing Dragonite, while Psychic Fangs is a niche option that allows for Zamazenta to hit both Clodsire and Toxapex while improving its matchup against dual screens hyper offense teams. Heavy-Duty Boots allows for Zamazenta to switch in safely regardless of entry hazards and fully leverage its bulk, allowing for it to come in multiple times over the course of a game. Choice Band can instead be used to greatly enhance its wallbreaking power, granting it key 2HKOs on Skarmory, Corviknight, and offensive Great Tusk, but this comes at the expense of Zamazenta losing out on longevity and the ability to hit subsequent switch-ins with its coverage options. An alternative spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe, again with a Jolly nature, allows for Zamazenta to still outrun +1 Adamant Dragonite, Weavile, and Darkrai while improving its bulk. This HP investment notably allows for Zamazenta to live Enamorus's Moonblast and even +1 Dragon Dance Roaring Moon's Acrobatics with Dauntless Shield active, but the lack of Speed is detrimental for the matchup against opposing Zamazenta. Tera Steel is selected to flip Zamazenta's matchup against Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon while also turning Heavy Slam into a powerful STAB option that cleanly OHKOes both Iron Valiant and Enamorus and providing Zamazenta with an immunity to Toxic from Galarian Slowking. Tera Stellar can instead be considered as an option that gives a one-time boost to all of its moves; this boost is strong enough to allow for Zamazenta to OHKO offensive Cinderace and a slightly chipped Ogerpon-W with Close Combat, while also giving it 2HKOs on both Raging Bolt and Pelipper with Close Combat and Stone Edge, respectively. This also gives Zamazenta a one-time nuke to break through weakened checks like Skarmory and Corviknight. However, this comes at the expense of Tera Stellar having no defensive value. Tera Fighting is a more niche option without any defensive merit that Zamazenta can opt to run, only boosting its Close Combat but crucially letting it 2HKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock. Zamazenta is a great fit for both balance and offense teams lacking speed control while giving these builds a check to Dark-types like Kingambit, Weavile, Meowscarada, and Darkrai. It appreciates entry hazard support to take full advantage of the switches it forces, pairing well with hazard setters such as Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor on balance and Landorus-T and Glimmora on offense. Zamazenta's ability to check both Weavile and Meowscarada pairs particularly well with Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T; Zamazenta's lack of recovery means that it struggles to switch in consistently on these Pokemon though. This makes bulky pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola much appreciated to allow it safe entry onto the field, the former also providing a much-needed switch-in to Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Galarian Slowking in particular forms a potent combination with Zamazenta, as Zamazenta's Close Combat dissuades Dark- and Steel-types like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon from switching into Galarian Slowking's Future Sight, while common switch-ins to Zamazenta such as Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Skarmory cannot safely come in and take both hits. Although Zamazenta's Speed tier is impressive by OU standards, it is still outsped by Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Choice Scarf users like Enamorus and Gholdengo, which are able to threaten it with heavy damage; priority attackers that can revenge kill these faster threats are therefore much appreciated. Kingambit in particular is a strong partner that can switch into Dragapult and Gholdengo and threaten both of these targets along with Deoxys-S with Sucker Punch, while Weavile cannot freely switch into these threats but is able to provide an alternative form of speed control that can also threaten Dragapult, Enamorus, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon with Ice Shard. With Booster Energy, Iron Valiant is also able to outspeed and threaten Zamazenta with Moonblast; Gholdengo makes for a solid check to Iron Valiant, also being able to come in on Galarian Slowking and Clefable that would live a hit and threaten Zamazenta back. In turn, Gholdengo appreciates Zamazenta's ability to threaten many of its common checks like Kingambit, Weavile, and Meowscarada. Rillaboom also makes for a great partner to pick off Deoxys-S and Iron Valiant with Grassy Glide while weakening shared checks like Skarmory and Corviknight with Knock Off to allow for Zamazenta to freely attack them without taking Rocky Helmet damage. Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain is particularly useful for providing Zamazenta with recovery to help maintain its longevity; Alomomola can similarly help to alleviate this issue by providing Wish support while also appreciating Zamazenta's ability to check Ogerpon-W. Zamazenta is walled by Gliscor and Clodsire when using Stone Edge as its coverage option, and so switch-ins to these Pokemon such as Gliscor itself and Clefable on balance and Hatterene on offense make valuable partners, along with powerful attackers like Weavile and Meowscarada to directly threaten them out. Zamazenta pressures some of the tier's common physical walls like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Skarmory; teammates like Kingambit and Weavile appreciate its ability to weaken these targets."

  "Zapdos": {
    "name": "Zapdos",
    "text": "Zapdos is a defensive pivot that is able to take hits, spread status, and build momentum for its team. Volt Switch is a strong option for a pivoting move, being both STAB-boosted and non-contact, but U-turn is a solid alternative to avoid being blocked by Ground-types if Zapdos already has Discharge as its STAB move. Thunder Wave is a powerful support move for slowing down the opposing team, whereas Heat Wave gives Zapdos a coverage option against Steel-types like Iron Treads and Kingambit, which can be 2HKOed by it. Heavy-Duty Boots is important for mitigating Zapdos's weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Steel gives Zapdos favorable matchups against foes like Kyurem and Galarian Slowking, allowing it to resist attacks like Ice Beam and become immune to status moves like Toxic while giving it the opportunity to spread paralysis, which it may not have been able to do otherwise. Tera Fairy is very useful for giving Zapdos a Dark resistance, allowing it to take hits from Roaring Moon's Knock Off and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave, thus providing more chances for Static to activate. Most of the EVs are put into Zapdos's Defense, with 16 Speed EVs allowing it to outspeed neutral-natured base 70s like Volcanion and Sinistcha. Zapdos is extremely useful on balance teams. Galarian Slowking is an excellent choice of teammate to tank special attacks from threats like Kyurem and Iron Valiant, while Zapdos can help it in return by switching into Ground-type moves that threaten it from Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T, pivoting back and forth between each other to support this. Zapdos can also form strong defensive cores with other bulky Pokemon like Zamazenta and Ting-Lu. Zamazenta is able to deal with less favorable matchups for Zapdos, such as Kyurem and Weavile, and Zapdos is able to help by pivoting to it safely. Ting-Lu can support Zapdos by setting entry hazards that can wear down foes like Gholdengo and Walking Wake so that they can be KOed by Zapdos more easily. Hex Gholdengo becomes much stronger with Zapdos as a paralysis-spreading partner, and it is then able to support Zapdos and its teammates with speed control, taking out threats like Dragapult and Darkrai. Zapdos struggles to make progress against common Ground-types like Gliscor, which are immune to Volt Switch, thus preventing it from pivoting. Gliscor can also threaten Zapdos with Knock Off. Teammates like Weavile and Kyurem are great at putting pressure on these counters, and they in turn appreciate Zapdos's ability to get them in safely. While Weavile and Kyurem make good teammates, they also make difficult foes for Zapdos, both of them outspeeding and KOing it. The aforementioned Zamazenta as well as Kingambit can put pressure on these threats. In exchange, Zapdos can help by taking hits from Pokemon like Great Tusk and opposing Zamazenta and crippling these threats with Static and Thunder Wave, giving a teammate like Kingambit more chances to sweep. Knock Off users like Roaring Moon threaten to remove Zapdos's Heavy-Duty Boots. Pokemon that can take hits from Knock Off, like Clefable and Gliscor, are great at helping Zapdos avoid this."

  "Zapdos-Galar": {
    "name": "Zapdos-Galar",
    "text": "Galarian Zapdos is a unique Fighting-type in the metagame because of its excellent offensive utility and good Speed tier. Knock Off is a staple for offensive Fighting-types to punish switches to Ghost- and Psychic-types like Armarouge, Gengar, Jirachi, Slowbro, and Reuniclus while doubling as item removal to rack up residual damage with entry hazard support. U-turn is an excellent pivot move, as it hits Psychic-types for super effective damage while giving teammates the opportunity to position onto the field safely into favorable matchups. Choice Scarf provides excellent Speed control, notably allowing Galarian Zapdos to outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Basculegion-F, Gardevoir, and Krookodile. Choice Band gives Galarian Zapdos the breaking power to 2HKO would-be defensive checks like Galarian Weezing and Slowbro, which isn't possible using Choice Scarf without supplementing the damage output with Terastallization. Defiant is excellent for taking advantage of Defog attempts from Galarian Weezing and Noivern and Intimidate from Krookodile and Salamence. Tera Flying turns STAB Brave Bird into a practically unwallable attack and has the added benefit of removing weaknesses to Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from the likes of Fezandipiti, Gardevoir, and Slowbro. Tera Dark provides similar defensive utility to Tera Flying, turning Electric- and Flying-type attacks from super effective to neutral, which is helpful against Thundurus and opposing Galarian Zapdos, while giving an immunity to Psychic and providing a STAB boost to Knock Off, allowing for an OHKO on Armarouge and a 2HKO on Reuniclus. It also provides a key immunity to Prankster, making Thundurus unable to hinder a late-game sweep with Thunder Wave. Tera Steel flips the weaknesses to Fairy-, Flying-, and Psychic-type attacks into resistances, giving defensive utility into Choice Scarf Gardevoir and opposing Galarian Zapdos, and gives an immunity to Poison that helps against Fezandipiti and Gengar. Using Tera Steel allows Choice Band Galarian Zapdos to pick up valuable damage or KOs into Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Gengar. Choice Item Galarian Zapdos can function on balance and offense teams as either a fast attacker and pivot with Choice Scarf or a strong breaker with Choice Band. Defensive teammates that can pivot and give Galarian Zapdos safe entry points like Cyclizar, Empoleon, and Jirachi are crucial to maximizing the immediate damage output and offensive pressure that it puts on opponents. Pairing Choice Band Galarian Zapdos's potent breaking power with Pokemon that excel at late-game cleaning, like Bisharp, Maushold, and Mimikyu, can be advantageous. Empoleon and Jirachi are notable teammates for their ability to absorb Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Fezandipiti, Gardevoir, and Slowbro and establish entry hazards. Offensive teammates like Basculegion-F and Hisuian Zoroark can threaten physical walls like Hippowdon, Jirachi, Slowbro, and Reuniclus and can form an offensive core that keeps momentum against otherwise strong defensive cores. Other teammates that can form a VoltTurn core with Galarian Zapdos like Barraskewda, Slither Wing, and Thundurus can put immense pressure on teams by forcing considerable chip damage with their strong pivot attacks. Capitalizing on this VoltTurn structure, Galarian Zapdos fits well on hazard stack archetypes, partnering with Chesnaught, Empoleon, Gligar, and Jirachi comfortably, as they provide defensive support and use its offensive pressure to wear down opponents. Galarian Zapdos lacks recovery and often takes a lot of recoil damage using Brave Bird, so Healing Wish and Wish support from teammates like Gardevoir, Jirachi, and Umbreon can improve its longevity and give it the staying power to consistently break through teams."

  "Zarude": {
    "name": "Zarude",
    "text": "Choice Scarf Zarude provides a solid speed control option with a decent amount of defensive utility. Zarude's Speed grants it the ability to pressure Latios, Greninja, Serperior, and Quaquaval at +1 Speed, while its typing allows it to switch into foes like +1 Speed Excadrill and Choice Scarf Hoopa and threaten them out. U-turn allows Zarude to pivot out against opposing switch-ins like Tinkaton and Okidogi, allowing it to bring in teammates that can threaten them. Close Combat gives Zarude super effective coverage for Ogerpon-C and Cobalion while also OHKOing Excadrill, while Jungle Healing grants Zarude the ability to shrug off status from Slowking, Rotom-W, and Zapdos. However, locking Zarude into Jungle Healing is very risky, due to the fact that the opponent will be able to switch anything in for free. Tera Dark gives Knock Off an extra boost in power, notably 2HKOing Serperior even after its item is removed, while Tera Fighting boosts Close Combat and makes Zarude less susceptible to revenge kill attempts from Lokix. However, Zarude loses its defensive utility when it Terastallizes, so it should only Terastallize when it is necessary to either revenge kill an opposing threat or clean up the rest of the game. Choice Scarf Zarude fits on offense teams that appreciate its compression as a revenge killer and Ground-resistant Pokemon. However, as a Choice item user, Zarude struggles with foes that can sponge its attacks and switch to a resist such as Hydrapple or Toxapex. As a result, it appreciates teammates that it can pivot to to pressure these foes such as Latios and Okidogi. Latios also outspeeds and pressures opposing Okidogi and Cobalion, allowing Zarude to more easily slot Jungle Healing, while Okidogi can sponge hits from Lokix. More offensively capable foes such as Enamorus-T and Okidogi can also switch into Zarude, so it appreciates defensive teammates that can withstand their attacks, like Tornadus-T and Pecharunt. Zarude also appreciates teammates that can handle the tier's Flying-types in Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and opposing Tornadus-T. Rhyperior and Excadrill both help against Zapdos and Tinkaton and provide Stealth Rock to help wear down the aforementioned Flying-types after Zarude removes their Heavy-Duty Boots. Rhyperior also offensively pressures Tornadus-T and Mandibuzz, while Excadrill provides entry hazard removal to prevent Zarude from being worn down by opposing hazards. Zapdos can act as a switch-in to Tornadus-T and Tinkaton while also offensively pressuring Mandibuzz and Okidogi. Zapdos, alongside other potential teammates like Tornadus-T and Slowking, also functions as a pivot that can bring Zarude in on foes it can pressure out such as Latios."

  "Zebstrika": {
    "name": "Zebstrika",
    "text": "Draft Order: Round 8 Price Range: 1-2 points Overview: Zebstrika can be a decent final pick to patch some holes in a draft with its great Speed tier, solid Attack with ok coverage, and nice immunities with its abilities. Unfortunately, it struggles with power as well as frailty, often needing Life Orb to achieve the KOs it wants while making its already subpar bulk even worse. Zebstrika also has a lot of competition with other low-tier Electric-types and wallbreakers that have the necessary coverage and power that it often lacks, making it a rare pick for most drafts. Mixed / Physical Wallbreaker: Zebstrika can use its great Speed tier and okay Attack stat to threaten some teams offensively. It typically relies on damage-boosting items to deal a reasonable amount of damage. Revenge Killer: Zebstrika can use its Speed tier coupled with Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer to a lot of opposing setup threats, and it is able to use Volt Switch to keep up momentum. Primary STAB Moves: Supercell Slam, Wild Charge, Thunderbolt, Volt Switch, Discharge Setup Moves: Flame Charge, Trailblaze, Agility Utility Moves: Thunder Wave, Taunt, Roar, Substitute Coverage: Overheat, High Horsepower, Low Kick, Smart Strike Endeavor: Endeavor can be used alongside Quick Attack and Focus Sash to potentially secure a trade against teams lacking a Ghost-type. Light Screen: Zebstrika can use Light Screen to let itself and its teammates take hits on the special side, but it unfortunately lacks Reflect. Damage-boosting Items: Zebstrika often makes use of Life Orb, as it wants all the power it can get and likes switching moves to use its solid coverage, and the recoil is not as important as it's already very frail. Expert Belt is an option if it doesn't want to take recoil damage from Life Orb. Choice Scarf: Zebstrika can use its Speed with Choice Scarf to outspeed most Speed-boosting setup threats and either paralyze them with Thunder Wave or threaten a KO. Focus Sash: Focus Sash can be used alongside Endeavor, or it can let Zebstrika survive one hit and nail something with a Thunder Wave, crippling an opposing Pokemon for the rest of the game. Choice Band / Specs: Choice Band and Specs can be used to boost Zebstrika's middling offensive stats, but it usually struggles with being locked into one move, since foes can easily take advantage of its limited coverage, so this usually isn't recommended. Air Balloon: Air Balloon can be used to gain entry on certain Ground-type attacks and temporarily help Zebstrika deal with its main weakness. Zebstrika generally shouldn't be a Tera Captain, as there are usually better alternatives available, but it can perform decently with options like Tera Grass and Ice to threaten the Ground-types that usually wall it. It can also use its abilities alongside Tera to make better use of its immunities and check certain Pokemon defensively. Zebstrika usually isn't recommended on most teams, but as a low-cost Pokemon, it can fit well on already-solid teams that appreciate the Speed tier and immunities it brings. Ground-types: Zebstrika struggles to damage most Ground-types not weak to its coverage like Great Tusk, Garchomp, and Donphan, as it lacks the coverage necessary to beat them, and they can easily force it out and gain positive momentum. Generally bulky Pokemon: Because of Zebstrika's middling Attack, it can struggle to do meaningful damage to most bulky Pokemon that are not threatened by its coverage like Landorus-T, Scream Tail, and Latias. Faster Pokemon: Zebstrika has next to no bulk, so most faster Pokemon like Cinderace, Darkrai, and Meowscarada can threaten it with huge damage. A weakened Zebstrika can also be picked off by priority. Chip Damage: Zebstrika can easily be chipped down into low health thanks its reliance on Life Orb for damage, entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, and Wild Charge / Supercell Slam recoil."

  "Zoroark": {
    "name": "Zoroark",
    "text": "Choice Specs Zoroark is a powerful wallbreaker that, unlike others, can surprise opponents thanks to Illusion and net KOs, paving the way for partners like Galarian Slowbro and Paldean Tauros-F. Sludge Bomb hits incoming Fairy-types that plan on taking a Dark Pulse like Scream Tail and Grimmsnarl. Trick allows Zoroark to maintain utility, as it can then cripple bulkier Pokemon like Wo-Chien and Florges and bulky setup sweepers like Scrafty and Arcanine. Focus Blast punishes Dark-types that try to take on Zoroark's Dark Pulse like Skuntank and Bombirdier. U-turn can also be run to give extra utility to Zoroark, allowing it to gain momentum. Tera Dark is preferred to boost Zoroark's wallbreaking capabilities to insane levels, allowing it to 2HKO Gastrodon after a layer of Spikes and non-Assault Vest Goodra, but Tera Poison gifts Zoroark a boost to its Sludge Bomb and a resistance to Fighting-type attacks, letting it survive a hit from Heracross and Paldean Tauros-F. However, Tera Fighting can also be used to boost Focus Blast's damage output, preventing Pokemon like Skuntank and Wo-Chien from taking on Zoroark as well as they could otherwise. Though, with the latter two Tera types, Zoroark's Psychic-type immunity turns into a weakness, worsening its matchup against Delphox, Meloetta, and Galarian Articuno. Zoroark's access to Illusion allows it to pair well with Paldean Tauros-W and Calm Mind Florges, as it can disguise as them to lure in and beats Pokemon such as Decidueye, Bronzong, and Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro, which tend to switch in to check them. Some of Zoroark's checks, namely Milotic and Assault Vest Hariyama, are open to getting chipped away at by entry hazards, so Spikes setters like Gastrodon, Alolan Sandslash, and Heracross pair well alongside it. When paired with physical wallbreakers like Emboar and Hariyama, Zoroark can have its specially defensive checks like Scrafty and Gastrodon overpowered while together they can chip away at shared checks like Milotic and Scream Tail. Fairy- and Fighting-types like Grimmsnarl and Flamigo force Zoroark out, so checks to these Pokemon like Salazzle and Bellibolt make for strong teammates. In return, Zoroark can chip away at bulky Water- and Ground-types they struggle against, such as Qwilfish and Gligar. While Zoroark can play mind games with Illusion, how healthy a Pokemon is can easily give away who's out on the battlefield, so it must be paired with teammates that have access to entry hazard removal like Altaria, Alolan Sandslash, and Tatsugiri. Although suffering competition from other Choice Scarfers such as Florges and Flamigo due to more spammable STAB moves and more utility, Zoroark finds itself a niche thanks to a spammable STAB attack in Knock Off, great Attack and Speed stats, and Illusion allowing it to create mindgames against the opposing team. U-turn allows Zoroark to pivot against awkward matchups such as Florges and Mudsdale while generating momentum for its team. Trick cripples walls such as Bellibolt, Milotic, and Terastallized Wo-Chien as well as setup sweepers like Florges and Scrafty that would otherwise try and switch into Knock Off or try to setup and sweep. Low Kick targets Pokemon like Coalossal and opposing Dark-types such as Wo-Chien for decent damage. Tera Dark boosts the power of Knock Off, allowing Zoroark to achieve rolls such as 2HKOing Rotom-H and OHKOing Bronzong and Ambipom after minimal chip and helping Zoroark to clean up games with Knock Off. Alternatively, Tera Fighting boosts Low Kick, OHKOing Alolan Sandslash while also providing a valuable defensive typing that allows Zoroark to resist Stealth Rock and U-turn, although it makes Zoroark lose its valuable immunity to Psychic. Choice Scarf Zoroark finds itself fitting on balance teams looking for a revenge killer and fast pivot. Zoroark struggles to break through bulky physical walls such as Bellibolt, Coalossal, and Mudsdale, so checks to these threats like Golurk and Paldean Tauros-W make good partners. Zoroark's ability to threaten out Bronzong, Delphox, and Galarian Slowbro makes it an excellent partner to Pokemon like the aforementioned Paldean Tauros-W, Toxtricity, and Salazzle. In return, Zoroark appreciates disguising as these three in order to play mindgames with its checks such as Wo-Chien and Milotic. Hazard control from Coalossal, Altaria, and Tatsugiri allows Zoroark to be a more effective pivot and revenge killer while also helping it to keep its Illusion intact. Zoroark appreciates teammates like Decidueye, Paldean Tauros-F, and Toxtricity that can take advantage to setup or revenge kill offensive Pokemon that threaten it out, such as Paldean Tauros-W, Scrafty, and Florges. Zoroark's high Speed and Special Attack alongside decent coverage allow it to serve as a threatening Nasty Plot sweeper. However, what allows Zoroark to excel in this field is its unpredictability, with its wide variety of sets and unique ability in Illusion giving it a definite niche over other Nasty Plot users such as Delphox and Salazzle. Sludge Bomb provides coverage for Fairy-types such as Florges and Grimmsnarl, as well as hitting other Dark-resistant foes such as Emboar, Hariyama, and Bombirdier neutrally. Flamethrower hits any remaining threats, OHKOing Skuntank and Heracross at after a Nasty Plot. Focus Blast is another option that hits many of the same neutral targets harder and, after using Nasty Plot, OHKOes some of Zoroark's largest roadblocks, such as Snorlax, Assault Vest Copperajah, Bulk Up Scrafty, and specially defensive Wo-Chien. However, this extra power is often not needed once boosted, and Focus Blast missing can put an end Zoroark's sweep instantly. While vast, Zoroark's special movepool falls short in power, so the extra boost from Life Orb is greatly appreciated and needed for many of the previously mentioned KOes. Heavy-Duty Boots can help Zoroark set up more safely and further help it bluff the opponent via Illusion, but losing out on the power boost from Life Orb is suboptimal. Tera Dark further helps with the lacking power, giving Dark Pulse its much-needed boost to KO bulky threats such as Milotic, Goodra, and Gastrodon with little previous damage. Tera Poison boosts Sludge Bomb to further its reliability against neutral targets and grants resistances to all of Dark's weaknesses, allowing Zoroark to tank a hit from threats like Florges, Flamigo, and Pawmot. Tera Ghost supplies similar resistances while giving up any offensive prowess for the useful immunity to priority moves like Arcanine's Extreme Speed and Pawmot's Mach Punch, and it can punish Choice-locked Pokemon like Emboar and Paldean Tauros-F. However, this also leaves Zoroark weak to previously resisted priority moves like Decidueye's Shadow Sneak and Skuntank's Sucker Punch. The defensive utility and surprise factor of Tera Poison and Ghost can also give Zoroark a chance to start setting up. Nasty Plot Zoroark is ideally run on offensive teams seeking a late-game special sweeper rather than the utility ran on Zoroark's other sets such as item control, pivoting, and speed control. As such, it should have teammates that can take out common revenge killers like Ambipom, Choice Scarf Staraptor, and Choice Scarf Paldean Tauros-F. Bellibolt and Mudsdale make for good defensive checks to these revenge killers, with the former notably being able to paralyze these faster threats with Static and safely bring Zoroark in with its slow Volt Switch. Knock Off users like Copperajah and Gligar can also be helpful with this due to being able to remove a foe's Choice Scarf. Smeargle or Vikavolt's Sticky Web is a niche option to slow down foes but is rarely run outside of teams centered around it. Fighting-types like Pawmot, Flamigo, and Hariyama pair well with Zoroark, simultaneously luring Psychic-type moves that it can take advantage of while benefitting from the opponent's hesitance to use them. Furthermore, they are able to check special walls like Scrafty and Snorlax for Zoroark. Psychic- and Ghost-types like Delphox, Hoopa, and Golurk can accomplish similar feats alongside Zoroark while keeping Fighting-types in line. The former two pair especially well with Zoroark due to also being able to run sets with both Choice items and boosting moves, leading to more mind games with the opponent. Wallbreakers like Goodra and Choice Specs Toxtricity can wear down special walls like Wo-Chien and Gastrodon to put them in KO range for a boosted Zoroark. Florges is an especially notable threat to Zoroark due to its bulk and Fairy typing, so checks to it such as Copperajah, Galarian Slowbro, and Arcanine are much appreciated. Zoroark stands out as a very strong Swords Dance user, leveraging the lack of defensive Dark-resistant Pokemon; the various Dark-weak staples like Galarian Slowbro, Delphox, and Golurk; and Illusion allowing it to disguise itself as other Swords Dance users to give it setup opportunities and tear holes in the opposing team. Knock Off and Sucker Punch are great STAB options that give Zoroark a devastating mix of wallbreaking power and priority, with Sucker Punch allowing it to pick off weakened Choice Scarf users like Staraptor and Rotom-C. Aerial Ace allows Zoroark to hit Fighting-types like Heracross and Emboar that would survive a +2 Knock Off as well as weakening all Paldean Tauros formes, while Low Kick removes Coalossal, Regirock, and Duraladon consistently; both of these options let it remove or severely weaken Scrafty and Wo-Chien. A Life Orb in conjunction with Tera Dark gives Zoroark outstanding power at +2; it gains great odds to OHKO physically defensive bulwarks like Bellibolt and Mudsdale after a single layer of Spikes, as well as always OHKOing Milotic, Altaria, and specially defensive Alolan Sandslash. Heavy-Duty Boots forgoes the power on Life Orb in favor of more bluffing potential and less chip damage, getting more setup opportunities as a result. Black Glasses can be used to hit similar damage benchmarks compared to Life Orb without taking recoil; however, it misses out on the guaranteed OHKOs stated above and has worse odds to OHKO Bellibolt and Mudsdale under the same circumstances. Swords Dance Zoroark is an effective wallbreaker but struggles with faster Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch and slower priority users that resist Sucker Punch, like Skuntank, Paldean Tauros-W, and Choice Scarf users like Flamigo, so checks to these Pokemon are highly recommended. Bellibolt and Houndstone are solid switch-ins on bulkier playstyles, while Paldean Tauros-F and Decidueye can use Skuntank and Paldean Tauros-W, respectively, as setup fodder or can easily revenge kill them with priority after Zoroark has weakened them. Zoroark heavily appreciates partners that it can disguise itself as effectively; some notable ones include Bruxish, Scyther, and Delphox, since Zoroark disguised as them can take advantage of their switch-ins like Milotic and Meloetta. Bruxish and Scyther's access to Swords Dance as well as Scyther's and Delphox's Speed tiers make it hard to tell if it's Zoroark or not."

    "text": "Hisuian Zoroark is a fantastic special wallbreaker and cleaner that utilizes its power and nigh-unresisted STAB combination to fire off devastating attacks whenever it enters the field. Illusion provides it with the unique ability to overwhelm the opposing team by forcing suboptimal plays and switches that attempt to minimize risk, which works especially well when paired with strong physical wallbreakers that share few checks with it. Its naturally high Speed enables Hisuian Zoroark to serve as either a blazingly fast cleaner with Choice Scarf or blow holes in its switch-ins with Choice Specs that can proceed to be exploited by its teammates. However, Hisuian Zoroark is incredibly frail and must be maneuvered carefully so that it doesn't get eliminated before making meaningful progress. The fact that Assault Vest Cyclizar, one of the best answers to Hisuian Zoroark thanks to its typing and access to Knock Off and Regenerator, is the most used Pokemon in RU holds Hisuian Zoroark back quite a bit. Additionally, as both of Hisuian Zoroark's STAB attacks can be blocked with immunities, it is quite prediction reliant and can end up whiffing in games by repeatedly getting locked into a useless move. Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark is an incredibly powerful wallbreaker that enables the art of bluffing with its signature ability Illusion and makes up for its relative frailty by naturally outspeeding most of the unboosted metagame. Tera Blast, while weaker than Hyper Voice before Terastallizing, gives Hisuian Zoroark the ability to blast through Assault Vest Cyclizar and Umbreon in conjunction with Tera Fairy. Flamethrower provides coverage for some of Hisuian Zoroark's checks like Bisharp, Wo-Chien, and Assault Vest Magnezone. Trick is a very useful and, thanks to Illusion, unpredictable move, as it allows Hisuian Zoroark to lock setup sweepers like Revavroom and Mimikyu into their setup moves and drastically decreases the effectiveness of defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Amoonguss. Grass Knot can be used as additional coverage to more effectively threaten bulky Ground-types such as Hippowdon and Gastrodon while also reliably OHKOing offensive Pokemon like Krookodile and Terrakion. U-turn serves as an easy escape option when it might not be wise to rely on a prediction and can be used in tandem with other U-turn pivots like Cyclizar and Galarian Zapdos to attempt to confuse the opponent with Illusion. Choice Specs supplements Hisuian Zoroark's wallbreaking power to impressive levels that can even 2HKO naturally bulky Pokemon like offensive Empoleon and Fezandipiti. Tera Ghost boosts the power of Shadow Ball to pick up important KOs on Pokemon like Revavroom, Conkeldurr, and Volcanion after some chip damage. Tera Fairy can be used to flip Hisuian Zoroark's weakness to Dark-type moves into a resistance, which is helpful for taking hits such as Knock Off from Krookodile and Galarian Zapdos and Sucker Punch from Bisharp as well as providing an immunity to Dragon-type moves such as Draco Meteor from Hisuian Goodra. Choice Specs Hisuian Zoroark fits best on offensive structures that appreciate its raw wallbreaking power and great Speed tier that lets it outspeed and exploit common Pokemon in the metagame like Krookodile, Jirachi, and Terrakion. Hisuian Zoroark appreciates entry hazard removal options like Cyclizar and Noivern that allow it to enter the field and attempt to blow holes in the opposing team more often. This can also help to continue disguising Hisuian Zoroark, as differences in entry hazard damage can sometimes be used to determine its identity despite Illusion. Hisuian Zoroark provides unique support to offensive Fighting-weak Pokemon such as Terrakion and Maushold, as its presence can deter Fighting-type moves from Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos and Mienshao. At the same time, physical wallbreakers like the aforementioned Terrakion and Slither Wing can threaten Hisuian Zoroark's defensive checks such as Empoleon, Hisuian Goodra, and Wo-Chien, while they themselves benefit from Hisuian Zoroark being able to lure in and heavily damage physical walls like Hippowdon and Chesnaught with the help of Illusion. Hisuian Zoroark benefits from entry hazards set by Pokemon like Hippowdon, Jirachi, and Chesnaught, as they can help chip down Pokemon like Krookodile, Galarian Weezing, and Amoonguss into guaranteed OHKO range. To support these hazard stacking cores, Hisuian Zoroark can function as a spinblocker in a pinch, though it fears Knock Off from Cyclizar. Choice Scarf Hisuian Zoroark capitalizes on its naturally high Speed, Special Attack, and Illusion to act as one of the fastest and most threatening cleaners in the tier. U-turn enables it to deal decent chip damage and safely pivot out into answers to its switch-ins, which allows Hisuian Zoroark to make progress without needing to rely on predictions. Flamethrower is a coverage option that hits Pokemon like Bisharp, Bulletproof Chesnaught, and Registeel that can absorb one or both of its STAB attacks. Trick is a fantastic move that allows Hisuian Zoroark to cripple bulky Pokemon such as Hippowdon, Umbreon, and defensive Empoleon that often rely on status moves to make progress and is not easy to see coming thanks to Illusion. Choice Scarf catapults Hisuian Zoroark's Speed even higher to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, slower Choice Scarf users like Gardevoir and Terrakion, and sweepers like +1 Speed Salamence, +2 Speed Cloyster, and Modest +2 Speed Basculegion-F. Tera Ghost boosts the and an OHKO on Gardevoir. Hisuian Zoroark fits well on offensive structures that benefit from its ability to outspeed and revenge kill powerful threats and clean up chipped teams in the late-game. Strong pivot partners such as Galarian Zapdos, Slither Wing, and Magnezone can form VoltTurn cores with U-turn Hisuian Zoroark that make full use of their ability to simultaneously deal damage to their switch-ins and pivot into another threat; examples include Hisuian Zoroark being able to deal with physical walls like Hippowdon and Slowbro, and the aforementioned wallbreakers in turn threaten some of Hisuian Zoroark's checks like Hisuian Goodra, Umbreon, and Empoleon. Wallbreakers lacking a pivot move like Terrakion and Armarouge can accomplish a similar role by wearing down the aforementioned defensive Pokemon to enable Hisuian Zoroark to clean. Illusion aids in both of these structures by creating situations where the opponent has to make predictions to safely switch into these wallbreakers, which can quickly turn sour if they get it wrong. Hisuian Zoroark appreciates entry hazard removal options like Cyclizar and Noivern that allow it to enter the field and attempt to blow holes in the opposing team more often. This can also help to continue to take advantage of Illusion , as differences in entry hazard damage can be used to determine its identity. Hisuian Zoroark itself benefits from entry hazards set by Pokemon such as Jirachi, Krookodile, and Gligar, as they aid in lowering the overall health of the opposing team and creating more opportunities for Hisuian Zoroark to clean. To support these hazard stacking cores, Hisuian Zoroark can function as a spinblocker in a pinch, though it fears Knock Off from Cyclizar. Furthermore, Choice Scarf Hisuian Zoroark can work well in hyper offense structures due to its ability to revenge kill threats such as Armarouge, as well as use Trick to neuter defensive Pokemon like Hippowdon and Quagsire that could otherwise pose problems to sweepers such as Shift Gear Revavroom and Swords Dance Bisharp. A Nasty Plot set alongside Heavy-Duty Boots is able to turn Hisuian Zoroark into a threatening sweeper while aiding it in its Illusion by removing entry hazard damage. However, it can be difficult to use safely due to Hisuian Zoroark's poor defenses. Focus Blast is a decent coverage option over Flamethrower that can similarly deal with Steel-types along with specific targets such as Assault Vest Cyclizar, Umbreon, and Empoleon, though it is often high-risk due to its low accuracy and Hisuian Zoroark's frailty and ironically renders it unable to deal meaningful damage to opposing Hisuian Zoroark. Knock Off can be used on Choice Scarf sets as an option to make progress by removing Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots from switch-ins like Umbreon, Registeel, and Fezandipiti. Special Tanks: Specially defensive Pokemon like Umbreon, Hisuian Goodra, Empoleon, and Assault Vest Cyclizar usually take little damage from Hisuian Zoroark's attacks and can proceed to easily take it out due to its low defenses. However, they should be wary of Trick, which can drastically hinder their ability to fulfill their roles. Faster Wallbreakers: Faster offensive Pokemon like Noivern, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Galarian Zapdos can outspeed and OHKO non-Choice Scarf Hisuian Zoroark thanks to its paper-thin bulk. Bulky Wallbreakers: Many of the naturally bulky wallbreakers in the tier, such as Eviolite Bisharp, Volcanion, and Assault Vest Magnezone, can absorb one or two attacks from Hisuian Zoroark depending on its item and promptly eliminate it."

    "text": "Hisuian Zorua provides excellent utility to a team with its combination of a high Special Attack stat, unique defensive typing, and its ability to spread burns and Knock Off. Thanks to its Normal typing, Hisuian Zorua can use Tera Blast as a STAB move even before Terastallizing to hit threats like Alolan Grimer and Shroodle. Tera Fight let it hit Pawniard and provides defensive value by flipping its Dark-type weakness, while Tera Ground additionally allows it to hit Alolan Grimer, Glimmet, and Tinkatink. Hex in combination with Will-O-Wisp's burns does massive damage to even bulkier foes like Mudbray and Toedscool while cleanly OHKOing Drifloon. Will-O-Wisp helps neutralize physical attackers like Pawniard and Crabrawler and can turn them into setup fodders for other sweepers. Knock Off lets Hisuian Zorua soften up opposing teams and is also its best option for hitting opposing Hisuian Zorua. U-turn is an alternative that lets Hisuian Zorua capitalize on the switches it forces from foes like Drifloon. Nasty Plot is an option on dual screens teams where Hisuian Zorua can become a threatening sweeper. Illusion is a highly unique ability that lets Hisuian Zorua create uncomfortable turns for your opponent by disguising as Pokemon whose checks it might beat, and Glimmet and Mudbray appreciate its ability to chip or beat opposing Mudbray and Drifloon, respectively. Pawniard enjoys Hisuian Zorua checking Crabrawler. Hisuian Zorua is often competing with Drifloon for the team's Ghost-type, so it appreciates teammates like Wattrel and Toedscool that can cover for its lack of Ground-type immunity. Crabrawler and Mudbray check opposing Pawniard for Hisuian Zorua when Tera Fight is not an option, and Alolan Grimer, Mudbray, and Croagunk switch into opposing Alolan Grimer."
